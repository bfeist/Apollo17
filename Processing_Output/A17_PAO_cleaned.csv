-01:22:00|PAO|This Is Apollo Saturn launch control we're at T minus 1 hour 22 minutes and counting. Cabin purge has now been completed and the boost protective cover has been closed. The 65 percent nitrogen 35 percent oxygen mixture will now be enriched to a 60 40 mixture at liftoff. Just completed were some preflight command tests with the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. These tests are to insure that Houston can send commands, and that they are being received on or by the launch vehicle. Also just completed was a first motion signal. This is the first motion of the vehicle as it lifts off the pad. A test signal is sent to the eastern test range and to the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston to assure that they will get this signal at liftoff. Also, we just received a final go for a Jim-sphere release. The Jim-sphere is a weather balloon which is the final weather balloon to go up before launch indicating the wind direction. C-band beacons are in check at this time. The C-band beacons aboard the launch vehicle are used in tracking. They give indications of range velocity during the power phase of flight. Que ball sim command was just sent. The que ball is an angle of a tacmeter which is purched above the launch escape system, and it's read by the spacecraft commander in the spacecraft. It would indicate any deviation from the planned flight route. It reads zero as it sits on the pad and during the test a simulated command is sent to it, and Gene Cernan in the spacecraft reads off what he is reading in the spacecraft during that sim command. The checks in the spacecraft continue to run somewhat ahead of schedule. The spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin indicated their running ahead and looking good to which Cernan repled we're looking good up here too. The countdown continuing to move along well at this time T minus 1 hour 21 minutes and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

-01:12:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control T minus 1 hour 12 minutes and counting. At this time Spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan and the Spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin are going over some command checks. During these checks the Spacecraft Commander actually gimbles the - or moves, swings the main engine in the Service Module. He does this using his flight hand controller and this is a system which is done so that if there is a problem with the computer which normally flies these, he can take over and manually fly it. Normally, however, all burns of this engine are done by the computer. Out at the pad, the space vehicle is surrounded by searchlights producing some 225 foot candles of light, a total of 72 20 kilowatt zeon lights and 2 60 kilowatt zeon searchligh banks provide this illumination. At liftoff, approximately 7500 foot candles will be produced from the flame of the Saturn V first stage engines. This is almost equivalent to daylight. Searchlight will also illuminate the Apollo 17 for the first 60 feet of its flight. Countdown continuing to go smoothly now as we approach the 1 hour mark. T minus 1 hour 11 minutes and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -01:00 CST 19:52 MC 3/1
-01:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T minus 1 hour and counting. T minus 1 hour and counting. Just completed were the C—band beacon checks. These are checks of the beacons, two of them aboard the instrument unit of the space vehicle. These are used in conjunction with C-band radar here at Kennedy Space Center to check the space vehicle during powered phase of flight. A check was just made with the superintendent of range operations who ran through the camera coverage looking at the weather around the various areas to see what camera coverage, and that appears to be satisfactory. Meanwhile, at the pad, the closeout crew has completed securing the white room area, and they are clearing the pad area themselves at this time. Just before they left, they indicated to Cernan that they were completed their jobs going back away from the pad area. Cernan said "We'll see you when we get back." The pad leader responded that "The next face you see had better be a frogman or you're in trouble." The weather appears to be satisfactory. We've been tracking some local buildups, but at this time they're just -they do not seem to be posing any problem for an on-time launch at 9:53 p.m. EST. Now, T minus 59 minutes, 32 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -0:55 CST 19:57 MC 4/1
-00:55:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We are at T-55 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Stoney, astronaut Bob Parker, the capsule communicator here in the firing room who has a variety of of functions during this mission; one of which is to set the elevators at the 320 foot level. He actually commands the elevators which are part of the egress system -emergency egress system, for the astronauts. He has just reported that the elevators have now been set at the 320 foot level. In an emergency the crew could come out of their spacecraft into these elevators where they would be lowered at a high speed, 600 feet per minute, to the ground floor or A level floor where they can exit from there into a variety of escape modes; one of which would be down a chute into a blast danger area or a safety area, or they could continue on out and be picked up by armored carriers. Underway at this time with the launch vehicle are some checks of the secure range safety systems aboard the vehicle. These are actually checks of the receivers in that system. A range Safety Officer could terminate the flight of Apollo 17 if it became irratic by initiating emergency cut off, or if necessary a propellant dispersion command. These systems are located on each of the flight stages. There are three stages of the Saturn V. Two receivers in each stage, and they would receive a signal from the range safety officers and then sending through them -through these receivers, they could perform the propellant dispersion. These actions, of course, will be taken only if the vehicle were so irratic that it were endangering some land areas, and of course, only after the crew had used one of the escape options open to them. The test going well at this time. Our countdown continuing T minus 54 minutes 6 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 20:02 GET -00:50 MC 5/1
-00:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T minus 50 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Preparations are underway in the launch control center at this time for a critical power transfer test. The space vehicle at this time is being fed from an external power source, but shortly before liftoff it will be transfered to the internal flight batteries. This test is to ensure that all electrical systems aboard the vehicle function properly on the internal flight batteries. The test takes about five minutes during which time the various elements of the launch team monitor thier systems and report in then to the test supervisor, Bill Schick here in the control room that everything looks good during the test. Depending on local weather conditions the various areas around the United States, the flight of Apollo 17 will be monitored or be able to be seen by people as far as 500 miles away. This is the flight as seen of the first stage of powered flight. This would include a large portion the southeastern United States, northern tip of Cuba and the Bahama Islands. The power transfer test is now underway; first stage, second stage, third stage, instrument unit now all going to internal power. Countdown continuing to go well T minus 49 minutes 35 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Test Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:45 CST 20:06 MC6/1
-00:45:00|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control, we're now T minus 45 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Various elements of launch team reporting in to test supervisor Bill Schick, that they experienced no problems during the power transfer. We now transfer back again to an external power source, which will feed the vehicle systems until approximately 50 seconds before liftoff, at which time the final power transfer to Internal takes place. At the T minus 45 minute mark, we'll be watching for swing arm number 9. That's the swing arm which gives access to the Spacecraft to swing back to a retract position, 12 degrees back from the Spacecraft. This is a park position, a standby position, where it remain down until the final moments of the countdown. T minus 5 minutes, it swings back to the full retract position. Once it swing backs, the launch escape system aboard the a-, atop of the Spacecraft can be armed and this system could be used to pull the Astronaut crew to safety in any disaster. Now T minus 44 minutes 52 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:41 CST 20:11 MC7/1
-00:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn - This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.  We're at T minus 40 minutes, 51 seconds and counting. Swing arm number 9 just retracted a few minutes ago, and, as it retracted, the astronaut crew aboard the space field could feel it moving away from the spacecraft. Eugene Cernan the spacecraft commander commented, "We're really hanging out here in the breeze now." Spacecraft test conductor, referring to the weather indicated that that was just a small breeze. The launch escape system has been armed. The system now could be used to carry the astronauts to safety if necessary. It's also used during the initial phases of powered flight to carry the astronauts away in an emergency. It would fly away in a high arc pulling them to a height, enough so that their parachute systems could deploy, and they could make a normal landing. The system is about 33 feet long. The motor develops 147 thousand pounds of thrust. This is almost twice the amount of thrust of the Redstone rocket, which powered astronaut Alan Sheppard, America's first man into space. The countdown continuing to move along smoothly now. T minus 39 minutes, 36 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 20:18 GET -00:25 MC8/1
-00:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, We're at T-minus 35 minutes 11 seconds and counting. Spacecraft commander Gene Cernan has reported back to the spacecraft test conductor Skip Chauvin. He said you've delivered us the best now it's our turn. Thank the guys we want to see them as soon as we can when we get back and I guarantee you we'll do that. Meanwhile C-band beacon checks are going on with the space vehicle. The liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen fully aboard and being replenished at this time to ensure a full load at liftoff. Count down continuing to go smoothly as we approach the half hour mark T-minus 34 minutes 34 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

-00:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. T-25 minutes 54 seconds and counting. Command Module Pilot Ron Evans at this time has armed the reaction control system aboard the service module. He does this by allowing the hypergolic fuels to move down the lines to the engines. At this time he is reading out the temperatures, pressures and fuel quantities in that system. Our weather continues to look good. The major frontal area which had been of some concern earlier, has remained well west of the launch area also some smaller buildups which we have been monitoring do not appear to be coming close enough to cause any concern for our 9:53 PM launch time. That launch will be aiming Apollo 17 for the Taurus-Littrow area of the Moon. This area is named after the Taurus Mountains. These in southern Turkey and the Austrian astronomer, Littrow. The site is expected to yield some of the oldest and some of the youngest lunar samples returned during the Apollo flights to the Moon. Now T-24 minutes 50 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

-00:20:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control T-minus 20 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Short time from now we we'll begin chilling the propulsion systems aboard the second and third stage of the Saturn V vehicle. This necessary to condition them for the flow of the super cool liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Just a few moments ago the crew aboard spacecraft America was doing an updated weather forecast. Cernan reported I hope it's as beautiful out there as it is in here. Countdown continuing to move smoothly at T-minus 20 minutes 24 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

-00:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 10 minutes 55 seconds and counting. At this time some computer checks being run with the launch vehicle. The spacecraft has now gone to full internal power. Up to this point the spacecraft fuel cells have been sharing the power load with an external source. Also going on at this time are some checks of the astro comm circuit. This is the circuit which is used by the launch operations manager spacecraft test conductor Stony and the three astronauts at launch time. This is to ensure that they are not getting any extrenious voices or are having to listen to any of the other network which might be carrying on a conservation which they don't need at that time. Countdown proceeding smoothly T-minus 10 minutes 15 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:08 CST 20:44 MC14/1
-00:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control T minus 8 minutes and counting. T- minus 8 minutes and counting. The Vice-President in the firing room at the launch control center, observing the final minutes of the countdown and he'll watch the launch from here. The countdown has proceeded smoothly since picking up at 11:53 A.M. this morning. Weather continues to look good as we aim toward a 9:53 P.M. Eastern Standard Time launch. Now T minus 7 minutes 37 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:01 CST 20:47 MC15/1
-00:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Launch Control. T-5 minutes 54 seconds and counting. At this time entering the final phases of the countdown various elements of the team reporting into Test Supervisor Bill Shick with the go no-go for launch. At launch time a water deluge system at the pad will spray water over the entire area of the pad, some 400 000 gallons of water. More than the average family would use in three years will be spread over the pad and the swing arms protecting them from the searing flames of the Saturn V first stage. Various elements reporting in now. First stage reporting they are GO. Range Safety, Superintendent Range Operations they are GO. Launch Operations Manager reports he is GO for launch. Launch Director Walter Kapryan has given a GO for launch. We've passed the 5 minute mark, T-4 minutes 55 seconds and counting and swing arm No. 9 now coming back to the fully retracted position. The launch escape system setting atop the spacecraft, spacecraft named America by the crew, now could pull the crew to safety if there were any problem while the vehicle remains on the pad or during the early portions of the flight. At the T-4 minute mark we'll be standing by for word from the Launch Vehicle Test Conductor Norm Carlson, giving a clear for launch for the launch vehicle ignition. At T-3 minutes 7 seconds we'll go on an automatic sequencer. It's called the terminal countdown sequencer. The astronauts on the Astro com circuit now reporting and thanking the launch team for all their prayers and all their help. T-3 minutes 55 seconds and counting. Apollo 17, the launch team wishes you good luck and God speed, reports the launch operations manager over the Astro com circuit. T-3 minutes 40 seconds, the countdown continuing to go on smoothly. Once we go on the terminal countdown sequencer, the countdown will be automatic from there on out. The countdown sequencer will initiate the various functions from that time on; however, the men here in the firing room will be monitoring their consoles, watching temperatures, pressures, various readouts. They could override that terminal sequencer if necessary. Moving up now to the time when we'll go on that terminal sequencer. T-3 minutes 10 seconds and counting. Spacecraft ready light has come on indicating that the spacecraft is ready. We are now on the terminal sequencer. Launch sequence has started. The flowing of that water on the pad will begin at the 1 minute mark flowing on the flame deflector below the launch vehicle on the launch pedestal itself and along the swing arms which will be coming back at liftoff. Instrument unit ready light has come on. Emergency detection system ready light is on. All indications are we are GO for launch as we approach the 2 minute 30 second mark. Pressur-ization of the various propellant tanks now aboard the space vehicle is starting. At two, our second stage liquid oxygen tanks now pressurized. These propellant tanks are pressurized with helium to insure that during the flight the fuel flows properly down through the engine. It's quiet here in the firing room now as the men are monitoring their consoles, looking at the temperatures, checking pressures and a variety of parameters to ensure everything is in a GO condition. Pressurization continuing on the fuel tanks at this time we'll go to the critical power transfer at the T-50 second mark in the count down. At that time we'll transfer external power source to the flight battery aboard the space vehicle. The final action by the crew aboard the spacecraft America will be a final guidance alignment conducted by the Spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan. The flight of Apollo 17 will be able to be seen depending on weather conditions, some 500 miles away as it goes into Earth orbit. Pressurization continuing, liquid hydrogen tanks now aboard the second stage have now been pressurized, all propellants aboard the second stage now pressurized. A cover aboard the cue-ball
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:01 CST 20:52 16/1
-00:01:00|PAO|A cover aboard the que ball. This is the que ball system on top of the launch escape system will be pulled off just shortly before launch. First stage propellant tanks have been pressurized. Now past the 1 minute mark and we are going on internal power. Now all systems to internal power. We'll be looking for the engine start sequence at the 8.9 second mark in the countdown. Engines will build up to a thrust of 7.6 million pounds. T-minus 30 seconds, we have a cutoff, we have a cutoff at T-minus 30 seconds. We are standing by at T-minus 30 second mark. We'll bring word to you just as soon as we get it. We have a cutoff at T—minus 30 seconds. T—minus 30 seconds and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're holding at the 30 second mark. This was an automatic cutoff. Cutoff by the terminal sequencer as mentioned this sequencer initiates various actions. Each action must take place and must be completed before the next one can be initiated. If anything does not get completed in time there will be an automatic cutoff. This cutoff was automatically done by the sequencer. We're standing by now to check just what the problem was. Now at T-minus 30 seconds and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. The astronaut crew aboard the spacecraft going through their various safing now. Safing of all systems and the launch team here continuing through their emergency procedures. We'll be standing by to check out the problem just as soon as we can get word. T-minus 30 seconds and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. The safeing procedures continuing at this time. Up to the T-minus 30 second mark the countdown had been proceeding smoothly. Weather conditions at launch were predicted to be and appears to be good at that time. However, we had an automatic cutoff from the terminal countdown sequencer and we're standing by to see just what caused that automatic cutoff. All systems being safed at this time. T-minus 30 seconds and we are in a hold. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:01 CST 20:59 MC17/1
-00:01:00|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold at the 30 second mark, while the launch team assesses our problem. The swing arm, swing arm number 9 will be brought back to it's park position, which is 12 degrees back from the space vehicle. Continuing the safing procedures this time and assessing the problem, holding at T minus 30 seconds, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

-00:01:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T minus 30 seconds and continuing our hold. The problem was with the terminal countdown sequencer, which failed to give the command to pressure, pressurize the third stage lox tank. The crew in the firing room, realizing this were seeing this happen pressurized the tank manually, but this did not happen fast enough to satisfy the automatic sequencer. As was mentioned earlier, during this sequence everything must happen at a certain time, before the next step in the sequence can take place. The next step that was to take place was the retraction of swing arm and at the time that was to take place the terminal sequencer had not had an indication that the third stage lox tank had been pressurized. The plan now is to recycle to the T minus 22 minute mark in the countdown. Now this recycling procedure will take an additional 35 to 40 minutes. This still puts us well within our launch window. While we're recycling, we'll continue to review the data to determine just what the problem is and whether or not we can proceed from the T minus 22 minute mark for a launch later in the window. The crew aboard the spacecraft has been alerted to the problem and understand what is happening. They're standing by there at this time. Now at T minus 30 seconds and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, We're remaining still in the T minus 30 second mark. We'll remain here for some period. It will take approximately 35 to 40 minutes to recycle back to T minus 22 minutes, where we'll resume the count. To explain again what has happened was we were in what was called the terminal countdown sequencer. At 3 minutes 7 seconds in the countdown we go on to an automatic system called the terminal countdown sequencer. This countdown sequencer initiates various actions, the final actions in the count. Each of these must occur on schedule and in sequence. Now what happened at this particular time was, the third stage liquid oxygen tank was not automatically pressurized as it should have been. The launch crew here in the firing room, when they saw this, manually pressurized that system, but it was too late to satisfy the sequencer. The next event in the sequence was the retraction of swing arm number 1, swing arm going over to the first stage and at that time, the sequencer did not see that the tank had been pressurized and sent an automatic cut-off. So we had an automatic cut-off at the 30 second mark. We're standing by at the 30 second mark to go back to T minus 22 minutes and we are reevaluating the problem, looking at the, what caused the sequencer not to automatically pressurize that tank, seeing what that problem is and seeing if there is a possibility if we go ahead and do this manually early in the sequence, if that will satisfy the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:01 CST 21:15 MC20/2
-00:01:00|PAO|sequencer and we can proceed. Now holding at the T minus 30 second mark in our countdown, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 21:25 GET -00:30 21/1
-00:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing to stand by here at the T-minus 30 second mark in the countdown. The crew remaining perfectly calm in their spacecraft. They have gone through their safeing checks. The various safeing checks of the launch vehicle have been completed. We are now going through preparations for recycling to the T-minus 22 minute mark. Standing by at this time at T-minus 30 seconds. T-minus 30 seconds and holding in the countdown for Apollo 17. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 21:30 GET -00:30 22/1
-00:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing our hold at the 30 second mark. We'll recycle to the T-minus 22 minute mark. The T-minus 22 minute mark is chosen as the recycling point because this is the point where we start the chill down as was mentioned during that point in the countdown. We start the chill down of the second and third stages to prepare them for the influx of the liquid hydrogen, the cold liquid hydrogen and the cold liquid oxygen. This chill down has some very specific parameters and must be started at a certain time and cannot go beyond a certain time. So it's best to go back to that point in the countdown under these circumstances and to resume our countdown at the T-minus 22 minute mark. When a determination is made that we can resume. Continuing to look at the data here is see exactly what happened. There is no indication of ignition. Ignition was scheduled to come at the 8.9 second mark. Here in the control room a number of the people were looking through the remote cameras which have the capability out at the pad of zooming in on specific areas and a number of people here were looking right at those first stage engines and there was no indication whatsoever of engine ignition. We're continuing to evaluate all the data at this time as we hold at the T—minus 30 second mark. This is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:30 CST 21:35 MC23/1
-00:30:00|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control still in our hold at the 30 second mark. While the launch team here is busy recycling to the T-22 minute mark, the mission team out at the Manned Spacecraft Center also preplanning some of the new time for the mission. They are also at this time busily preplanning the new launch azimuth. The azimuth now if we go at the next opportunity would be the 81.06 degrees. This will be automatically fed into the instrument unit of the Saturn V vehicle from the Manned Spacecraft Center. All elements of the launch team now putting everything together, checking over data and doing their best to put us back into a recycle position ready to pick up the count at the T-22 minute mark. Still evaluating data, however, and we have not at this time been given a GO for that resuming of the countdown. T-30 seconds and holding at this time. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

Continuing our hold at the 30 second mark back at the mission control center in Houston the flight controllers returning to their seats now after some consultation. They're back now giving status check and getting ready in case we are - it is determined that we can pick up the count. In the firing room here, the Apollo Program Director Rocco Petrone has moved into the viewing area where the President - Vice President Spiro Agnew and NASA administrator James Fletcher are and he is giving them a briefing and a run down on our problem. We are standing by at this time. The clock has now been recycled to the T—minus 22 minute mark; however, we have not picked up the count at that mark. We are now at T-minus 22 minutes and holding.

We're back to the T minus 22 minute mark and at this mark which we will pick up the count if we are given a go to resume. Check has been made of the Mission Control Center team at the Mission Control Center in Houston. All elements of that team reporting that they are ready to resume as soon as they get the word. Now standing by here at Kennedy Space Center, while data is reviewed and determination will be made if and when we can resume our countdown for Apollo 17. Now at T minus 22 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

-00:22:00|PAO|This Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We are continuing to standby at the T-22 minute mark. We are hoping to resume the count shortly. The problem has not been resolved. We're continuing to look into it; however, it has been determined that a resolution one way or the other should be able to be made shortly. So right now we are continuing our recycle procedures hoping to pick up the count perhaps just minutes from now. If the problem is not resolved by the time we reach the T-8 minute mark after we continue to count down, the clock will be held again. Right now we are continuing the recycling procedures hoping to pick up shortly at T-22 minutes. We are now T-22 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

We've been given the word here in the firing room now that the count will be resumed at 11 p.m. at T-minus 22 minutes. At this time there still has not been a resolution to the problem, but we'll continue looking at that. We could continue on counting down while this problem is looked at. To reiterate what the problem was; the terminal countdown sequencer failed to give the command to pressurize the third stage liquid oxygen tanks. The crews monitoring this function saw that that happened and immediately manually pressurized the tanks, but this did not occur in time in the sequence and when swing arm one was to retract it had not received this signal. As a consequence an automatic cutoff was sent. There are several possible work arounds to this they are being looked into at this time, and we plan to resume our countdown at the T-minus 22 minute mark at 11 p.m. Now holding at T-minus 22 minutes. This is Kennedy Launch Con t rol.

Back at the Mission Control Center the men there are updating the launch azimuth. Launch azimuth standing now at 82.54 degrees. This will automatically be feed into the instrument unit. The swing arm, swing arm No. 9, the access arm to the spacecraft, remains at the 12 degree position it will remain there until the T-5 minute mark in the countdown. Going on at this time are the recycling of some of the vents for the liquid hydrogen and the liquid oxygen. These are the vents which allow the venting of the gases as there is some boil-off occuring. It is necessary to continue venting these to ensure they do not freeze in either an open or closed position. The countdown proceeding smoothly now. T-13 minutes 43 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control.

We can hold at that point for 20 minutes and plan a 20 minute hold while the launch crew here satisfies themselves that they have worked out a good solution and a work around to the problem. The crew has been alerted aboard the spacecraft. Cernan indicated that perhaps they could start a nice conservation about a good book, Thomas Hardy or something like that.

The crew feels that they have, that they have a work around to the problem, working around the indication going to the terminal sequencer that the tank has not been pressurized, when actually it had been done manually. They are checking all of their data, however, to insure that this is the proper method to work around the problem and that this will result in a smooth countdown from here on. Now at T minus 8 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

The launch operations manager has gone over with the launch team their proposed solution a work around. The team appears to be satisfied that it is the proper one. They are now briefing management personnel on the problem and the work around. Out at the pad the liquid oxygen continues to vent from the vehicle and is replenished. Liquid hydrogen is also vented from the vehicle as there is some boil off. However, because it is quite a volital fuel it is vented through a burnpond at the side of the pad. That burnpond is at the north side of the pad and there it can be seen burning in a controlled condition at this time. This is a normal condition, actually during the day this burns in such a pure manner that it cannot be seen. However, at night it is clearly visible. Our countdown continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark at this time. T-minus 8 minutes and holding this is Kennedy Launch Control.

Me an time the crew is getting a variety of updates in the spacecraft, updating them on various aspects and the changes to their mission due to this hold period. Also, at the Manned Spacecraft Center they are continuing to update the flight azimuth as they get new times for the launch. Launch Operations Manager Paul Donnelly just went through quite an extensive briefing with the spacecraft test conductor to pass on to the crew what they feel the problems were and how they plan to work around it . The crew aboard the spacecraft indicated that if the launch team was satisfied with these solutions, that they certainly were confident themselves. Now continuing our hold at the T—8 minute mark this is Kennedy Test Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 GET -00:08 CST 22:33 MC34/1
-00:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're continuing in our hold at the T minus 8 minute mark. At this time, it's been determined to take an additional 20 minutes, add an additional 20 minutes to that planned hold period. The reason for this is, the crews would like to take the work around that they have devised and at Marshall Spaceflight Center, where the Saturn V launch vehicle was developed, they have what is called a bread board or a system, which is similar to this one and run through the sequence and insure that it does operate properly. The crew aboard the spacecraft was informed of this additional 20 minute hold. They indicated that they expected to use all three stages of this Saturn V and they were happy to have the 20 minute hold if that was going to assure that all three were going to work properly. Now continuing our hold at the T minus 8 minute mark, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 22:40 GET -00:08 35/1
-00:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Test Control. We are continuing our hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. The reason the T-minus 8 minute mark is chosen for this hold as mentioned earlier has to do with the chill down of the thrust chambers in the S-2 or second stage and the third stage. Both of these stages use liquid hydrogen, an extremely cold cryogenic fuel and the thrust chamber must be conditioned prior to flight so that it's ready at the time of ignition inflight to receive these fuels coming in. To achieve the proper temperature the thrust chamber chill down should not exceed 20 minutes, but it must be on for at least 7 minutes and 40 seconds. So rounding that off the hold was called at the 8 minute mark. We can continuously hold it at this point whereas if we continued on down we would have to watch these parameters very closely so that we'did not exceed that 20 minute accumulated cooling time. At this point we can continue our hold and that continuation can be determined by the problem and we can pick up then at any time or continue at long as necessary. We're continuing that hold now at T-minus 8 minutes and holding. This is Kennedy Launch Cont rol.

Back at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the crews there are at work on a bread board, or a mock-up of the system in question, where they're putting it through it s paces, checking out the work around solution, that is, jumping around this erroneous signal, and insuring that everything works properly. The crew still standing by in the spacecraft, updating various systems there, updating their flight plan, all continuing to go well there. The crew at the Manned Spacecraft Center also doing considerable amount of updating. They'll be continuing to update the azimuth, and the Launch Control Center here at Kennedy Space Center, the launch team manning their consoles, standing by to pick up the count, when we're given the word to go. However, we're standing by still. At this time, we have no word from the Marshall Spaceflight Center. We're expecting that to come within 10 to 15 minutes from this time. Now at T minus 8 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

Test Supervisor Bill Shick just announced here in the Firing Room that the hold is expected to last approximately 20 more minutes. Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen continuing to be replenished aboard the 3 stages of the launch vehicle at this time. That replenishing will continue during the hold period and during the final minutes of the countdown. The countdown continuing in the hold. T-8 minutes and holding this is Kennedy Launch Con t rol.

Work is still going on at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Updating of the tracking continuing at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. And the launch team here at Kennedy Space Center preparing to pick up the count. Hopefully, we will be given a go ahead to pick up the count in approximately 10 to 12 minutes from this time. We are continuing to stand by waiting to hear from the testing going on at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. To recap the activities earlier today the countdown picked up at 11:53 a.m. after a planned hold period picked up at T-minus 9 hours mark shortly after that time the pad was cleared and we began loading the cryogenic fuels, that's the liquid hydrogen and the liquid oxygen aboard the space vehicle. Those operations actually went a little bit ahead of schedule. The astronaut crew went out to the pad, enter their spacecraft, began checking it out and those operations also running a little bit ahead of schedule. We went on to our terminal countdown sequencer at the 3 minute 6 second mark as scheduled. Everything seemed to be proceeding fine. At the T-minus 30 second mark we got an automatic cut off. It was determined that this cut off came because pressurization of the liquid oxygen tank aboard the third stage was not initiated automatically as it should have been when it was done manually the terminal sequencer did not sense that this had been done and therefore gave the automatic cut off. We're working the problem right now continuing to hold at the T-minus 8 minute mark. T-minus 8 minutes, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

-00:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch control. We're continuing our hold at the T minus 8 minute mark. We have approximately 5 more minutes remaining in that hold. It has been determined that the workaround is a correct and satisfactory one, A bread board or a sample system at the Marshal Spaceflight Center was used to run through the entire sequence as it now configured and that operated satisfactorily. What happened was the - during the terminal sequencer, the liquid oxygen tank was not pressurized automatically. When this was done manually, the indication did not get to the sensors in time so that we had an automatic cutoff. The liquid oxygen tanksaboard the third stage, it has been determined, will be pressurized manually early in the terminal sequence and jumpers have been installed so that we can then feed the information to the sequencer so that it will not have an indication that the LOX tanks have not been pressurized. This - a bread board situation of this has been constructed at the Marshal Spaceflight Center in Huntsville and this has operated satisfactorily. So, it's been determined to go ahead with our countdown on this basis. We'll be planning to pick up the count at the T minus 8 minute mark some 4 minutes from now. Now T minus 8 minutes and holding.

Safety indicates that we have a GO, First stage test conductor, this is the man who has charge of those five first stage engines which will give us the lift off, has indicated a go for launch. Launch Operations Manager, Paul Donnley, also giving us a GO for launch, and finally the Launch Director, Walter Kapryan says we are GO for launch. We've passed the five minute mark now and swing arm number nine, this is the access arm to the spacecraft, is coining back to the full retract possition. It moves back along side the mobile launch tower and it will remain there now through the final portion of the countdown and the launch. At the T-minus 60 second mark 20 nozzles will start flame deflector deluge of 13 000 gallons per minute of water pouring down on that flame deflector, so a great deal of what is seen at launch time, which looks like smoke, is actually steam as this water is burned off. This water's to cool the pad area and to cool the equipment along side the launch tower as the water also pours across the swing arms in the launch tower. We are approaching the 4 minute mark in the count down now, T-minus 4 minutes 5 seconds and continuing to count. At the 4 minute mark we'll stand by for a final GO from Norm Carlson, Launch Vehicle Test Conductor. He has given a GO.

|PAO|This is Apollo Control coming up on 14 minutes after liftoff, that liftoff coming about 2 hours 40 minutes late, and we'11 be assessing the effects of that late liftoff on subsequent events in the mission timeline, passing those along. One of the effects will be a change in the acquisition of signal loss of signal time and as we move along on the ground track -
|SC|C off.
|CAPCOM|Stand by in there, Jack.
|SC|I've been carrying very low amps on the BAT BUSS and I did not see a drop. I'm carrying about 2 amps now. Volts are 30.5.
|CAPCOM|Jack, go ahead and take the BC motor switchoff.
|SC|Okay, it's off and I confirm that one.
|CAPCOM|And we think it's the (garble) power switch and the fuel cell LAT switch that are drawing the current you are seeing there.
|SC|Okay, that could well be.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we're going to lose you in about one minute off the vanguard here and see you at 52:20.
|SC|Roger, we're fresh and thanks, Bob. Okay, Bob, everything is looking GO on board. Everything's stable. We can see the AMPs firing and our attitudes look good.
|CAPCOM|You know everything is good shape down here - the boosters are in good shape, they're looking good and their AOS time is 52:20 as I gave you.
|SC|We got that, Babe, we'll see you coming around.
|CAPCOM|Good show, Babe, little late but its a good show .
|SC|Absolutely right.
|CAPCOM|Testing Houston, we're hanging with you here. Looks like you're hanging in vanguard a little longer than we e xp e c te d.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 16 minutes 45 seconds after liftoff. We've confirmed Apollo 17 is in a near nominal orbit. The crew reported an orbit of about 93.5 by 89.5 based on their onboard calculations and computations on the ground show that we're very close to the nominal ninety mile nautical mile orbit. As a result of the late liftoff, the translunar injection will be a little bit earlier than the flight plan ground elapsed time but we'don't have an update on this time yet. We expect that it will be on the order of 8 to 10 minutes early. We'll update that time as we get a later update. We would expect that the time of arrival at the Moon will be approximately the same as the flight plan time in terms of Greenwich Mean Time. The ground elapsed time will be somewhat earlier and we expect that there will be clock update ~ a so called clock update - at some point where we make the clocks in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft agree with the ground elapsed time that they would be showing in the flight plan. The net effect will be that we'll arrive at the Moon in a shorter ground elapsed time -in effect about 2 hours 40 minutes earlier than the flight plan would show, but at the same Greenwich mean time or local time here on Earth, that - that we would have had had we lifted off on time. We're in effect making up the time by speeding up the arrival at the Moon. The spacecraft at translunar injection will be going somewhat faster than a nominal liftoff translunar injection. Consequently, it will arrive at the Moon going slightly faster, and also somewhat earlier, about 2 hours 40 minutes earlier in terms of ground elapsed time. This will also mean that the lunar orbit insertion will require a bit more energy to slow the spacecraft down and get it into lunar orbit. These details of course, will all be worked out in the time that we have before our lunar orbit insertion. And, when we get an updated translunar injection time, we'll pass that along
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/6/72 CST 00:24 GET 00:25 MC 47/1
000:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 24 minutes. Apollo 17 now in an orbit about 90 miles by 93 miles and everything appears to be nominal aboard the spacecraft and aboard the launch vehicle, Saturn third stage. One additional impact of our late liftoff will be the loss of television coverage for the transposition and docking maneuver. The television coverage will not be possible because the ground track has shifted and we'don't have the site coverage that had been expected for television. The translunar injection burn, reigniting the Saturn third stage to put the spacecraft on its trajectory to the Moon, is now scheduled to occur at a ground elapsed time of 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds, or roughly 9 minutes earlier than the flight plan time. This again the effect of the late lift off. And we will be reacquiring Apollo 17 through the Carnarvon Tracking Station at a ground elapsed time of about 52 minutes 20 seconds, roughly 27 minutes from now.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control now 32 minutes after the liftoff of Apollc 17 and we have loss of signal with the spacecraft, we will be reacquiring through the Carnarvon Tracking Station in about 20 minutes. And from the President of the United States we have the following message to the crew of Apollo 17. The message reads: As you set forth on the final Apollo expedition to the Moon I want to have my personal best wishes for a successful mission and safe return. I am sure your voyage, your scientific exploration, will be the crowning achievement in a program which has expanded man's horizons, brought great credit to your country and lifted the spirits of people all over the world. God speed to you all. Signed Richard Nixon. The flight Dynamics officer, continuing to process tracking data, following orbital insertions, reports that there is a small amount of out of plane error showing up in the orbit. This is believed is due to a small error in the ins truient unit of the Saturn thrid stage. However, the orbit is very close to nominal, about 90 nautical miles by 93 nautical -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 0:35 CST 24:03 MC 48/1
000:35:00|PAO|However, the orbit is very close to nominal - about 90 nautical jiiles by 93 nautical miles. And, we look very good, both with respect to the spacecraft and with respect to the Saturn 3rd stage which must perform that burn putting Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. At 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston. This is Apollo Control. The postlaunch press conference at Cape Kennedy is scheduled to begin at 12:33 central standard time, 1:33 a.m. eastern standard time. Again, that time 12:33 central standard time, 1:33 eastern standard for the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 00:51 CST 24:25 MC 49/1
000:51:00|PAO|Control at 51 minutes into the flight of Apollo 17 and we're standing by to reacquire the spacecraft through the Carnarvon, Australia, tracking station. One of the things the booster engineer will be looking for when we reacquire them and get good log on the data will be the Saturn 3rd stage instrument unit. Looking at one brief bit of data before we lost signal, it appears that one of the four batteries in the instrument unit had a very high current drain on it. We will be looking closely at that to see if it was simply a telemetry problem or if, in fact, that battery does have some problem. And we should be about 15 seconds from reacquiring.
|SC|Hello, Houston, how do you read 17?
|CAPCOM|17, read you loud and clear.
|SC|Hey, we're going real well up here, Bob. Have no significant anomalies as yet and we've just about completed our part of the insertion checklist. Gene has his SCS check yet and Ron's got some P52 numbers for you and the only thing I've seen so far is some spurious master alarm without caution and warning that seem to be associated with moving switches on p an e 1 2 .
|CAPCOM|Okay, can you get a sudden (garble) switches anywhere, anytime they switch it on?
|SC|So far it's been fairly random. Some that I remember is the secondary cooler loop evap switch, the lamp test switch, let's see - I think I got one with the TEMP and auto switch. Gene got one doing something - I can't remember exactly what it was.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Jack, we're standing by for that P52 data. We've only got about a 4 minute - or a 5 minute pass here. We'll take the P52 data and I got a few updates for you.
|SC|Okay, 52 data is coming. NOUN 71 is 24 and 30, 905 is .01, 9 9 3s are plus .080, plus .Q29er, plus .018, and retort at 3525.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. Okay, while we're filling in some here, you might want to know this, Jack, your sunset and sunrise times in the launch checklist are all off by 8 - approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds. That every - sunset and sunrise will occur about 8 minutes and 30 seconds sooner than in the launch checklist. That's an approximate number. Okay, we got you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and on page 2-17 of the launch checklist, you're going to want to delete all reference to Honeysuckle, AOS and LOS, and delete all reference to Canary's AOS and LOS.
|SC|Willco.
|CAPCOM|And we want to add an Ascension pass AOS, an Ascension one plus 54 plus zero zero, and Ascension LOS will b e 020016.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 00:51 CST 24:25 MC49/2
000:51:00|SC|Okay, Bob, you're going to have to repeat that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by. Let me give you a page. On 2-17 - let's go to Hawaii AOS first of all. Hawaii AOS on page 2-17. AOS is 01 plus 17 plus 24. Hawaii LOS 01 plus 22 plus 4 minor.
|SC|Gotcha. Now what about the Ascension.
|CAPCOM|Okay, here I'll give you the Ascension again now. AOS 1 plus 54 plus 00. Ascension LOS will be 020016. Over.
|SC|Okay, I got those- Hawaii is 1 plus 17 plus 24 and LOS is 1 plus 22 plus 49, and Ascension is AOS 1 plus 5400 and LOS 2 plus 0016.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, good copy. And booster's looking good down here and you look good.
|SC|Okay, and I'll do a better job of itemizing : those switches. We were pressing pretty hard and I'll be able to go back and get most of them, I think, and we'll keep an eye on it on the master alarms.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, we understand, and I think we copied most of what you said there and we're working on it.
|SC|Okay, Bob, other than that master alarm, all is well on America and I understand the booster is looking good to you.
|CAPCOM|That's (garble)1,
|SC|And Bob, let me add that not - we'did get spurious master alarms without switch movement, but many came with switch movements. We've had about seven.
|CAPCOM|Okay, understand.
|SC|And that was only after insertion.
|CAPCOM|Seven time that you heard (garble)1;
|SC|Oh, we were paying attention to a sunset that was the biggest - or sunrise or something that we saw. It was the biggest rainbow I'd ever seen.
|CAPCOM|Beautiful. We can't wait to hear what you had to say about that ignition on the S2 . It sounded pretty spectacular.
|SC|Well, I just let it be said that that was quite a booster ride; and when we get a chance a little later, I'll just tell you about it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 00:51 CST 24:25 MC 49/3
000:51:00|CAPCOM|We're about ready to lose time here. You re looking great, guys, and we'll pick you up in Hawaii here shortly.
|SC|Okay, we're looking at the deserts of Australia right now and again everything is good on board.
|CAPCOM|Roger, pick you up at 1:172 4.
|SC|Gotcha.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're coming up now one 1 hour after liftoff for Apollo 17. And as you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmyer reporting to the crew that everything looks good including the Saturn 3rd stage. Apparently the indication we had of a possible battery problem in the instrument unit nothing more than a bad bit of telemetry there. When the booster engln eer got a good hard look at the telemetry on this pass, he reported everything looked good. We are ready at this point to begin the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy and we 11 switch to Cape Kennedy and stand by for that press conference
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 1:25 CST OlOO MC 50/1
001:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 1 hour 25 minutes after lift off. During the postlaunch press conference at Cape Kennedy, we had a short aquisition with the crew through the Hawaian tracking station. During that period of conversation, and during that period of monitoring the systems on the spacecraft and the launch vehicle, we found that the situation was essentially unchanged. That is both vehicles now looking good; the spacecraft and the launch vehicle. And we're progressing toward a normal translunar injection. 1 hour 46 minutes 50 seconds from now. The crew has discussed one unexplained series of events. It appears that when certain switches are cycled or moved on panel 2 which is the main panel in front of them, the center panel of the spacecraft, they're getting a master caution and warning signal. A light comes on - a tone comes on. This is to attract the crews attention that something may be wrong and the normal procedure is then to look at another matrix of lights which would zero them in on the problem. The light - the system or the subsystem or particular area being monitered, or which had the problem would light an individual light. However, when they go to this other matrix of lights, they find that none of them are lighted. This is leading the crew and the flight controllers here in mission control to believe that they are getting an SP signal to the master caution and warning, when in fact nothing is wrong. we'don't have any further explanation for the problem at this point. We will continue to look at the data and particularly during the translunar coast, we think we'll get a good long time to look at things in detail and try to find out precisely what is happening. At this point however, the problem presents no concern and one of the more likely explanations -possible explanations that's been advanced is perhaps some contamination in some switches. we'did accumulate some taped conversation during the press conference with the crew. We will replay that for you now and then stand by for acquisition of signal over the United States.
|SCHMITT|Hello Earthlings. We're back with you.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, Read you loud and clear, how us?
|SCHMITT|Loud and clear, and no change systemswise that I've seen.
|CAPCOM|Roger Jack. Any more master alarms?
|SCHMITT|We had one when Ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Sounds like we had something loose on panel 2 , huh?
|SCHMITT|Yeah. I don't kn ow - it may be annoying but so far it doesn't seem to be a problem.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Just for your information. Everything is looking outstanding and no problems, we're taking a look at the data at Hawaii and we'll make a Go/No-Go decision about 60 seconds after acquisition at Goldstone, but there's nothing right now to lead us to believe that zero ppportunity will be required.
|SC|Okay, Bob, understand that we are prepared, however, spacecraft other than those master alarms is looking very good. We got the docking probe extended. The SCS reference dtat 2 check i s complete.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 1:25 CST 0100 MC50/2
001:25:00|SC|Okay, Bob, I just remembered another switch that I think gave us a master alarm was H20 quantity indicator.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that, Jack. H20 quantity indicator. Roger. We're going to lose you in about 30 seconds, when you get over stateside here we're going to take - take the dump on the data and we'll read it out real carefully so when you get TLC we ought to be able to see where that master alarm click is coming in to.
|SC|Okay, Bob and yell at me if you want anything done on the COMM with it's change in AOS and LOS and all that stuff.
|CAPCOM|Negative on that right now. We'll see you at 12859 through Goldstone.
|SC|Okay, 12 859 Bob, we'll be there.
|CAPCOM|Roger Gene. Okay, Houston, we're back with you.
|SC|Okay, Bob we're still same as before and ready when you are for TLI.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I can see the lights of southern California, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|We're going to be going a little bit south of that area.
|CAPCOM|Roger, your ground path looks like it taking you right up over the mid part of Baja, California.
|SC|Yes sir. I believe that. I bet you I can see Encinada right now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Bob. I expect you'll probably be able to see the lights in Silver Cit.y too.
|SC|Well, I'm sure going to be looking for them, I'll te11 you.
|CAPCOM|Jack, just for your information, you'll probably when you come up (garble) and you get over Mexico, you should be able to see all that bad weather that - that was giving us so much worry and had Tindall and New Orleans and everything all messed up this morning when I went through there. It was a pretty bad line of weather along there.
|SC|I assume it wasn't too bad. I think you made it didn't you?
|CAPCOM|Oh, yeah, I made it but I had to - you know I had to work at it. But it's a - I was worried about it getting down as towards Mila there after - you know if we had to scrub and go tomorrow night. Boy, I'm sure glad we got you off tonight.
|SC|Guess who else is.
|CAPCOM|I wouldn't believe that.
|CAPCOM|Parker can't make it back. He's got to come back on the Gulfstream, so you might have to have Young on for a while after we'do a TLI.
|SC|Hey, you just wouldn't believe, Bob the light you can see in the west right now. It must be absolutely clear.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Sounds spectacular. Jack, people in the room here want to know if you've been down your checklist yet.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 1:25 CST 0100 MC 50/3
001:25:00|SC|Oh, we got that out of the way in about 5 minutes. Have we missed something?
|CAPCOM|There's a different checklist we're talking ab o ut.
|SC|(Laughter) If you're talking about the flightplan, yes.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|What a waste. If I'm not mistaken we must be just south of Arizona now. Is that right? right Bob?
|CAPCOM|That looks real good. Yeah, you're over Mexico there and looks like you're oh - maybe a hundred miles south of the border there.
|SC|Okay. I'm pretty sure I'm looking up into Ph o en i x-Tu cs on complex there.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Understand.
|SC|Beautiful. (garble) Yeah, the west is always that way. I wish it was daylight so we could see Senora and that country. That's spectacular, i'll bet you. (garble)
|SC|Bob, we're coming through a large - squeal right now in the background.
|SC|Un de rs t an d .
|SC|Okay, I think we got Gulf coast showing up now by the band of lights. Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger,
|SC|Okay, Bob, assume the booster is still looking good and we'll be GO for a nominal TLI.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And you're still coming up with a loud squeal,
|SC|Rog (garble)
|SC|Would you believe we are just south of Houston n ow , B ob ?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 0110 GET 1:35 MC 51/1
001:35:00|PAO|17 are you receiving Houston now?
|SC|Sorry, Bob, it came up unreadable with the squeal that time.
|PAO|Am I still squealing, is this Houston.
|SC|That's afirm, you're very loud, almost unreadable with the squeal. A1, why don't you give it the short count?
|CAPCOM|Geno, don't change anything, we think it's a ground site situation here and just stand by.
|SC|I believe it's in the VHF, Bob.
|SC|Okay, Bob, I'm not sure exactly where we are, but I'm looking out to an awful lot of lights on the horizon out there at 12 o'clock and an awful lot of lightening in the clouds out there.
|PAO|Roger, we show you just about the middle of the Gulf, look out ahead and you're probably seeing the very tip of Florida there.
|SC|It looks like almost the entire Florida peninsula has got lights all blinded in somewhere.
|CAPCOM|How does my comm sound to you now, Gene ?
|SC|Okay, give us a short count.
|CAPCOM|Roger, short count follows: Five, four, three, two, one. One, two, three, four, five, short c oun t out.
|SC|Bob, you're all right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And can you give us a feel for what the final weather was at the Cape at launch.
|PAO|Yeah, let me get that for you. The reason why we had that problem on the comm is we just handed over from Texas to MLA and you're going through MLA now and it's great and so we so we have a little problem with our Texas site.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|The television coverage had you all the way through staging very well in the S 2 ignition then and you went right behind a cloud for a while but they were tracking you pretty well.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|They also cut in for about a half minute or so and showed a view of the crowd in the just the available light from the booster and it stood out pretty well.
|SC|Okay, Bob, we're going right over Florida now, looking down at Miami, a beautiful view of the Keys all lit up and I just saw a shooting star right ove r Miami.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|That's a very very fine view of Miami, hard to believe.
|CAPCOM|I'll bet they sat there and watched you go.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 0110 GET 1:35 MC 51/2

|SC|Well, I'm not easily impressed, Bob, but I'm certainly impressed by this one.
|CAPCOM|What's the CMP doing, we haven't heard much from him. Is he at the other window?
|SC|He's crawling around looking for things down in the LAV.
|CAPCOM|Okay, they want let you jam a window tonight, huh, Ron?
|SC|Naw, I'll catch one here pretty quick.
|CAPCOM|Just a reminder, if you haven't all ready done it, there is no need to unstow the TV 'cause due to this late launch there's just no site available.
|SC|Okay, Bob, we're not going to unstow it.
|SC|Bob, I don't - I guess there's no site available for sometime, is that correct.

|CAPCOM|Roger, we'll copy that. It's interesting. You know, you're just directly over that south Atlantic area. Your pass just kinda kept you going right between the Africa and South America - right dead center all the way. And, 17, just for your information, we've searched all the data we can and we cannot find anything wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. Everything is looking real fine and the only problem in the air is that those master alarms that you have reported - we're not able to tie in anything common yet to any of those things either.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 1:55 CST 0130 MC 53/2
001:55:00|SC|Okay, Bob, we have not had any for quite some time, I think, since the last time we talked to you about them.
|CAPCOM|Roger, I understand. We'll probably get a good workout on that after TLI and try and track it down a little mo re.
|SC|Okay, but also, we have not really been doing much switching since the insertion checklist was complete, either.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand. Got you glued to the windows, I guess, huh?
|SC|They are interesting, I'll say that. Well, I certainly am, Bob, and again there's a big - a continuous intermediate cloud deck, I think. It has patterns comparable to what I've seen on pictures of ice flows, (garble). Pack Ice, I should say, pictures of pack ice in the Antartic.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. We've got two questions con cerning the master alarms. One, do you get the master alarm on the LEB also; and two, do you get the tone with the master alarm?
|SC|we'did get the tone. The master alarms were on both panel 1 and panel 3. I can't tell you about the LEB right now. Maybe Ron can. No, I didn't pay that much attention.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Hey, Bob, there was something interesting, I want to get around to tell you. The mission timer down in the LEB when Ron went down there to get things squared away, was about 15 seconds or so behind all the other clocks.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'll copy that.
|SC|Okay, an d w e re s et i t , re synched it, an d i t 1 s been running okay. I don't know whether that's a clue to anything or not, but apparently it happened either during launch or somewhere before we got down there right after insertion.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're going to lose you here in about 9 seconds. Your GO is looking great and we're working on it and if you get another MEV, will you check the LEB board?
|SC|Yes sir, I sure will do, Bob. We'll see you. What's our next DO I?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. Carnarvon at 2:25.
|SC|Thank you.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 now over the horizon from the Ascension site - will be reacquiring in about 25 minutes through Carnarvon. And, as you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmyer advising the crew, we've been getting a good look at all the data, and spacecraft launch vehicles look fine. No discernable problems. Gene Cernan did mention one anomaly and that was the mission timer. One of the — one of the numerous clocks aboard the spacecraft which was running about 15 minutes slow - and someone said it appeared that it happened either during the launch phase or shortly before they got down to take a look at it in the lower equipment bay. No explanation for that one at this point. And we show now 1 minute - 1 hour, rather - 11 minutes until ignition for the translunar injection maneuver, the burn with the Saturn 3rd stage which will place Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. Ignition time and still holding at about 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds ground elapsed time, and that burn will be about 5 minutes 45 seconds in duration, but we'don't have the final calculated time from the flight dynamics officer which will undoubtedly vary somewhat from the premission flight plan time. At 2 hours 2 minutes this is Apollo Control Ho us t on .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 0200 GET 2:25 MC 54/1
002:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 2 hours 25 minutes. Apollo 17 now approaching the west coast of Australia. And we'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in about 35 seconds. During this pass over Carnarvon we expect to pass up the first set of numbers to the crew that they'll use in the translunar injection burn to put them on their trajectory toward the Moon. That maneuver is scheduled to begin at 47 minutes from now. And we have acquisition of signal a little bit early.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. How are you going?
|SC|Well, we're pretty good. Your wavery a little bit on signal strength.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We've got a TLI pad anytime you're ready to copy it, Jack.
|SC|Okay. Let me get rid of some of - Ron, I'm putting that right underneath you.
|CAPCOM|And guys, we'd like POO and ACCEPT please.
|CAPCOM|Your CSM state vector if you'll give us POO and ACCEPT.
|SC|Got POO and ACCEPT. Okay, let me have my favoritepad.
|CAPCOM|Okay, here's the TLI pad. Time base 6 302 57 180 312 000 551 Delta VC is 10359er 6 35582 000 345 040, extraction will be at 300 165 320 3120 3060 5710, Yaw is 0. Ejection time 4 plus 3 9er plus 00. Over.
|SC|Okay, Houston. Here's your TLI. 302 57 180 312 000 551 103596 35582 000 345 040 300 165 320 3120 3060 5710 000. Ejection time 4 plus 39er plus 00.
|CAPCOM|Good readback Jack, and we'd like OMNI Charlie.
|CAPCOM|And it's your computer and you've got your state vector.
|SC|Okay, you've got OMNI Charlie. And Bob we had almost a completely weather free passover Africa and Madagascar. And the scenery both aethes ti cally and geologically was something like I've never seen before for sure.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Got odds and ends on the tape and quite a bit on the film.
|CAPCOM|Roger, good show. Are you saying that you didn't have any weather over that southern Africa there?
|SC|Not very much. Barely broken clouds in some places. Most of the countryside was clear.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|There were patterns like I haven't even seen in text books. Maybe I haven't been looking enough but some of the dessert and grassland patterns were - had the appearance of ice crystals on most except on a megascale here. Ever looked at ice crystals in s an d.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 0200 GET 2:25 MC 54/2
002:25:00|SC|Or better yet, ice crystals on your car window when you get out early in the morning up in northern areas.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And just be advised that we'll be standing by for the Go/No-Go for power arm when you get to Hawaii and we'll be giving you a Go for TLI about that time.
|SC|Okay, and we'll be ready.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, on the launch checklist, on 2-25 on the manual and nominal S-IVB TLI 1, add 34 degrees on the nominal pad for all the pitch angles, and on the manual pad add 34.5 degrees to all the pitch angles and you'll have it right.
|SC|Okay, Bob. (garble) Okay, we'll just add 34 to the nominal and 34.5 to all the manual ones.
|CAPCOM|And you'll want to do that on your cue card Ron.
|SC|Yeah, that's arfirm.
|CAPCOM|And we're about ready to LOS, so I'll see you in Hawaii,
|SC|Okay , Bob .
|CAPCOM|2 plus 50 in Hawaii.
|SC|Okay, 50 and we'll be into our TLI checklist and we'll be ready for Power arm.
|CAPCOM|Okay. ^This is Apollo Control. We'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in about 18 minutes. Arid during that passover Carnarvon, and we've passed up the numbers to the crew they'll use in the translunar injection maneuver. The burn is targeted to last 5 minutes 51 seconds with a change in velocity of some 10 359 feet per second. Accelerating Apollo 17 to the required speed to get it into an orbit that will intercept the Moon. And the time of ignition, 3 hundred 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds and we're showing an ejection time of 4 hours 39 minutes. The transposition and docking maneuver which preceeds ejection, is somewhat fluid in that it's done when the crew and mission'contro 1 are ready following translunar injection. However, from the projected time for ejection, it would appear that transposition and docking will occur about 25 to 30 minutes ahead of the nominal flight plan time. And we're now 39 minutes away from the scheduled ignition for translunar injection. At 2 hours 34 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 0224 CST 2:49 GET MC-55/1
002:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 2 hours 49 min utes. We're standing by now to acquire radio contact with Apollo 17 through Hawaii. During this Hawaian pass we're getting another good look at spacecraft and launch vehicle systems. The last look we had through Carnarvon everything looked very good. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, going over the status for these flight controllers observed that there appeared to be no problems that would interfere with TLI and we expect to have a normal translunar injection, about 23 minutes from now as Apollo 17 completes its stateside pass and moves out over the Atlantic Ocean at the start of its third revolution.
|SC|Houston, this is Apollo 17, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Ron, you're sounding great. Good voice h e re.
|SC|Golly, we've got things all set up here and we're kind of standing by for logic check whenever you guys can give us a go.
|CAPCOM|Roger, as soon as we get some TM in here, we'll give you a go.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. We're ready for the logic ch e ck .
|SC|Okay, Bob. Okay, six arm breakers are closed.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, and logic 1 is on market and logic 2 is on market.
|CAPCOM|17, you're go for PYRO ARM.
|SC|Thank you, understand go for PYRO ARM.
|CAPCOM|17 - -
|SC|Say, Bob, in case you're interested there - all through the night side pass here - there's a - quite a strong - well - stronger than I would have ever expected -horizon glow off to the north. I suspect that, I think that Gene said awhile ago that it's around on his side also.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Guys, I've got the word you wanted to hear, you are go for TLI - you're go for the Moon.
|SC|Okay, Robert. I understand. America and Challenger with their S-IVB are go for TLI.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|You're a sweet talker.
|CAPCOM|We try to please here, Gene.
|SC|You know, somehow Bob, I knew you were going to say that -- that we were go - and that you try to ple as e .
|CAPCOM|We've been working together too long, huh?
|SC|Not long enough, yet.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 0224 CST 2:49 GET MC 55/2
002:49:00|CAPCOM|And, 17, Houston. You're about 1 minute from LOS and we'll pick you up at Goldstone at about 3 hours and 00 minutes and that's only a couple of minutes prior to time base six start.
|SC|Okay, Bob. We'll be with you.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, that glow is actually above the horizon, just in case you're curious. I can see stars below the top of the glow - down closer to the Earth.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 03:34 GET 2:59 MC 56/1
002:59:00|CAPCOM|17, Houston, we're with you again and you're looking good.
|SC|Okay, mighty fine. Bob.
|SC|And,Bob, we've got the piles ironed out.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And you can expect some different OMNI calls as we go LOS and AOS again.
|SC|Okay, I always expect that, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And it's down on time,
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|And it shows time bay 6 right on time, Gene.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|We'd like OMNI Delta, Please.
|SC|Okay, you've got it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I'll just switch, Bob, I won't give you a call.
|CAPCOM|Right.
|SC|Sup light was out on time.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 3 hours 4 minutes. We are now some 8 minutes away from ignition. Everything's looking good for the translunar injection maneuver, the combined S-IVB Saturn third stage and the spacecraft with an orbital weight of three hundred eight thousand two hundred ninety eight pounds at the start of this maneuver.
|SC|I'll check, Bob.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, go ahead.
|SC|I was just checking with you, you're so quiet down there we almost forgot you were there.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Don't wanta forget me. We're just watching everything, we can't find anything wrong, so we're just trying to keep quieter.
|SC|Okay, Bob, we're watching here for B tanks pressurized.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gotta look for the good things rather than the bad.
|CAPCOM|Well, that's good when we'don't find anything wrong.
|SC|Can't agree more.
|CAPCOM|17, the chilldown is in progress and the tank pressures are looking good.
|SC|Okay, Bob, looking good here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 3:09 CST 0244 MC 57/1
003:09:00|CAPCOM|17, Houston, you are GO at 3 minutes prior to ignition, you're looking good, and we're going to have a ARIA coverage all the way through the burn until the session.
|SC|Roger, understand, Bob, 5710 ORDEAL operate..
|PAO|And we're coming up now on 2 minutes until ignition. This burn, again, will be a 5 minute 51 second maneuver. The S-IVB engine, delivering about 225 000 pounds of thrust, and it will be increasing the spacecraft velocity in the current state of about 25 000 feet per second up to about 35 5 85 feet per second.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we confirm it.
|SC|SEP light on at 3:06.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|And booster reports the ullage engines are on. This is to settle the propellants in the S-IVB prior to ignition. We are at 53 seconds from ignition.
|CAPCOM|17, you're looking great on the final status check here and your're GO for TLI.
|PAO|20 seconds now to ignition and we're main taining communications with the spacecraft through one of the ARIA, Apollo range instrumented aircraft.
|SC|Roger.
|PAO|lOseconds.
|SC|The light is on and we have ignition. And, very faintly we copy the crew reporting S-IVB ignition and that's confirmed by the telemetry and booster reports the thrust looks good on the S-IVB.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, you're looking good and the thrust is GO.
|SC|Roger (garble). We go on board in 20 seconds.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|And telemetry data from the Saturn instrument unit shows the velocity increasing up now to 26 000 feet per second, beginning to climb ever more rapidly. This burn was initiated at an altitude of about 97 nautical miles above Earth, and when finished, the spacecraft will be at about 15 0 miles above Earth, and on its way to the Moon, some 213 000 miles nautical mi 1es away.
|SC|One minute, Houston, inclined and we're GO.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. We can barely hear you through the ARIA but you're GO.
|SC|You have a reasonable signal here, but you are un re adable.
|PAO|Very weak voice communications and booster says the data is now static but at last look everything looked normal.
|SC|(Garble) 145.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, we can confirm PU shift and you are GO.
|PAO|That was CAPCOM Robert Overmyer confirming to the crew that our data showed the Saturn shifting its propellant utilization for a most efficient utilization of the propellant.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 3:09 CST 02:44 MC 57/2
003:09:00|SC|Okay, Houston, 2 30 in the blind we're still GO.
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17, you're GO, looking great.
|SC|Okay, Bob, got that. Understand we're GO from the ground and it's a good ride although it's rumbling around a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|Coining up now 3 minutes into the burn and velocity approaching 30 000 feet per second.
|SC|3 minutes and we are GO.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Bob, we're going to TLI right through sunrise.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|PAO|Gene Cernan reporting the TLI burn has taken them out of darkness and into sunrise now and we're showing a velocity of 30 463 feet per second.
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17.
|PAO|Apollo 17 now about 107 nautical miles above Earth and continuing to climb ever more rapidly. 4 minutes and 30 seconds now and everything continuing to look good. Apollo 17 at a velocity of 32 000 feet per second.
|SC|Bob at 430, you're still reading.
|CAPCOM|Roger, how do you read me? You are GO (garble)
|SC|Okay, we got you that time. Understand we're GO on the ground and we're still GO here and we're TLI right through a sunrise.
|CAPCOM|Understand.
|PAO|5 minutes now, less than 1 minute to go, and booster engineer reports that we're very close to the nominal predicted shutdown time.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, your burn time is nominal.
|SC|I understand burn time nominal.
|PAO|Shutdown time now in about 21 seconds. Show ing a velocity of 33 000 feet per second. Altitude now approaching 150 miles.
|SC|Cutoff at 52. Did you read the DSKY?
|CAPCOM|we'don't have the DSKY - you have to read it to us, Ron.
|SC|Okay, VI is - I got a 00 and a 00 and a 995 VIS. 355 73......is at plus 9. And, Bob, the EMS is minus - the EMS is minus 19.4 minus 19.4.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
|SC|And it was an auto cutoff - auto cutoff on time .
|CAPCOM|Understand a guided cutoff on time. Looking great.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 3:09 CST 02:44 MC 57/3
003:09:00|SC|And I am watching tank pressures - tanks are venting, the tanks are venting.
|CAPCOM|Understand. The tanks are venting.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 0256 GET 3:20 MC 58/1
003:20:00|PAO|Well, we're still getting communications through the Apollo Range instrumented aircraft. We'll be picking up through Ascension shortly, at which time we'd expect the communications to improve, the noise to drop off. From Gene Cernan's report, also from the reports from Ron Evans, it appeared that that translunar injection was extremely close to nominal. The crew read a cut off time of 5 minutes 52 seconds. The premaneuver prediction was 5 minutes 51 seconds. And the cutoff velocity appeared to be very, very close to the planned normal. Booster engineer, Frank Van Rosilier reports the booster cutoff appeared to be exactly normal. And booster engineer now predicting that the maneuver to separation attitude will begin in about 3 hours 33 minutes 27 seconds.
|SC|Okay, Houston. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|17, Houston we'd like OMNI Delta.
|SC|Okay, I fixed it up a little bit. How do you read n ow?
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, I hope you got all that. It was a beautiful burn right through sunrise. Did you get the numbers?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we copied your VI and EMS numbers and we've got a number for you - maneuver start time will be at 3 plus 33 plus 2 7.
|SC|Okay, we got you. Maneuver at 3 33 27.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack.
|SC|You guys didn't tell us we couldn't see anything going through the sunrise.
|CAPCOM|(Laughter) Roger.
|CAPCOM|17 Houston, we're making plans here for the spacecraft sep time of 3 plus 43.
|SC|3 plus 43. Roger.
|CAPCOM|17 Houston, we're copying cabin press of 5.9 this t ime.
|SC|Roger. We just got it, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Thankyou.
|PAO|Thisis Apollo Control at 3 hours 30 minutes. The Flight Dynamics Officer has just reported that -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 0306 CST 3:30 GET MC-59/1
003:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 3 hours 30 minutes. The flight dynamics officer has just reported that initial tracking, following the translunar injection burn, shows the spacecraft to be on a very nominal trajectory, and a relatively small midcourse correction indicated at this time. The pre-burn prediction on that first midcourse correction was around 5 feet per second and we expect that that will be updated as we get additional tracking following the burn. In about 3 minutes the spacecraft should - the launch vehicle should be - begin maneuvering to the proper attitude for separation and we're predicting separation to occur at about 3 hours A3 minutes - or about 13 minutes f rom n ow.
|SC|Frame 65 for the LNPS mag, November, No ve mb e r.
|PAO|About 10 seconds now until the Saturn third stage begins maneuvering into the proper separation attitude. And booster engineer reports from telemetry data that the booster has begun maneuvering into the proper attitude for spacecraft separation.
|SC|Okay, we are maneuvering, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're watching it.
|SC|Now we've got a few very bright particles or fragments or something that go drifting by in the maneuvers.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|SC|There's a whole bunch of big ones on my window, - just bright - it looks like the 4th of July on Ron's window.
|SC|Yeah, now you can see some of them have shape. They're very jagged, angular fragments and they're t umbling.
|CAPCOM|Roger, look like fluid of some sort?
|SC|Not to me, they look like pieces of s o me t h in g .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|They're very bright.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'd OMNI copy Charlie.
|SC|Bob, for the most part, these fragments are not - or are tumbling at a very slow rate. I tried a couple of pictures of them, different settings, you may get an idea of what at least, the patterns look like.
|CAPCOM|Roger, I've got you. We're all ears on these fragments. Do you think you can figure out what they mi gh t be?
|SC|Well, you know - I don't know — there are a number of possibilities. If you had some kind of a - I got the impression that maybe they were curved a little bit as if they might be a - off the side of the S-IVB - and that's a wild guess -
|SC|Okay, I see (garbled) logic is -
|SC|Ice chunks, possibly, or maybe there's paint coming off of it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 0306 CST 3:30 GET MC 59/2
003:30:00|CAPCOM|Rog. I noticed on one trip up the eleva tor last week there was a slag, 1 thought it was on the S-II but it might have been on the S-IVB. Looked like it was peeling. Maybe that's what you've got. And the S-IVB perforation plate - (garbled)
|SC|Okay, and we'll set the old clock. Okay, with the maneuver complete - the fragment field is - seems to be static except for very slight tumbling within the fragments.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Cut in.
|SC|Every once in awhile a fragment of considerably higher velocity goes across my window. But that's very rare.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's that field X wanted you to see out my window. Jack, do you see it now?
|SC|Yeah. Hey, Bob. At least, there's no apparent relative motion between fragments.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Understand.
|SC|I'll take 2 pictures about a minute apart if I can, and it will be frame 70.
|CAPCOM|Okay, frame 70.
|SC|And, Bob. You know, my impression is that they are - a - flat, flake-like particles, some may be 6 inches across and although there's no relative motion between the two, most of them seem to be twinkling and I think for the most part, they're all moving away from us.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene, thank you.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 0316 GET 3:40 MC 60/1

Okay, I'm going to start the - my God, look at the junk. Okay, that's 15 seconds. Pitch her up. Okay, we'll proceed on the - Okay, we've already proceeded, Jack. Okay, we've checked her out.
|SC|Houston, we're right in the middle of a s n ow storm.
|CAPCOM|Roger. It looks like Hadley Delta.
|SC|Hey, look at that booster. It's going to be bright as all get out.
|SC|And there goes one SLA panels.
|SC|Yes.
|SC|We're all okay. Long ways to go, yet. It's on the other side of the Earth, if the simulator is any good.
|PAO|Apollo 17 now in the process of turning around after having separated, blown the pyrotechnic charges that separates the spacecraft from the Saturn third stage.
|CAPCOM|Roger, bet you never saw the SLA panels on the simulator.
|SC|No, but we've got the booster and is she pretty. Challenger is just sitting in her nest.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|We're - we'd like otnn i bravo now, Jack.
|SC|Okay, plus Xitnow andsee you later.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Oh , can ' t s ee my CO AS .
|SC|And Houston, some of the particles gone by the window fairly obviously seem to be paint.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll buy that.
|SC|Okay. There it is. Okay, changes the (garble) . Got ATT rate 2,

|SC|Houston, how do you read? we'don't have a very good lock on here in REACQ.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, we're reading pretty good in voi ce.
|SC|Okay, it looks like it's improving. It dropped off - signal strength dropped off and now it's picking up again.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|We're getting good signal now, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Jack, the high gain is looking good.
|SC|I'm guessing. I don't know - about a hundred (garble).
|SC|It seems to slew very smoothly so it looks all ri ght.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|ATT 1 rate 2.
|SC|I can't tell you too much, Bob, from the center seat other than Captain America is very intent on getting Challenger at the moment.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Roger, I can believe that.
|SC|Yes, I'm coming in a little slow but we've got plenty of time.
|PAO|Ron Evans now at the controls of America. Now moving in for the docking with lunar module Challenger.
|SC|Now, while we're moving in here I can see a few chunks of that flaky material, possibly paint down in the SLA sort of bouncing around between the S-IVB and the LM.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|But so far -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 03:26 GET 3:50 MC61/1
003:50:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|But so far LM looks very clean. Can't see anything abnormal from this view yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|I tell you, it's really stable out there.
|SC|Ye ah , can you steer it alone, Gene?
|SC|Got one little chunk coining out - just came out of the SLA - spinning along axis and it looks very stable.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Every once in a while a small particle flies off of it though.
|CAPCOM|How big of a chunk are you talking about, Jack?
|SC|Say again.
|CAPCOM|How big an item are you talking about?
|SC|Oh, I - reference to the thrusters, about the same diameter as the thruster on the left.
|CAPCOM|Oh, Roger.
|SC|That's how long it was, and about oh, l/5th that thick or that wide.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And I don't think it's more than 1/4 of an inch or maybe even less thick.
|SC|That same particle (garble) came by (garble) and it was spinning as it was throwing off pieces of itself.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy.
|SC|There's a small one come floating by and it looked like f 1 ak e s  An d I think I caught 3 of the 4 SLA p an els going as we were maneuvering. I got one out the hatch window now. It's quite a ways out.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It's tumbling in all 3 axis.
|SC|And I saw the 4 th one out my side.
|SC|Area around the two spacecrafts is cleaned up Pretty well by now. There's just a few fragments moving around.
|SC|Now she's coming in.
|PAO|The crew of Apollo 17 describing what appeared to be paint or possibly ice flaking off the Saturn 3rd stage. But somewhat puzzling at this point is just exactly what the flakes or particles that they're describing might be. And Apollo 17 in the process of docking with the lunar module. Preparatory to extracting the LM from the Saturn 3rd stage. This occuring at some 5300 nautical miles from Earth. And we're watching the spacecraft velocity drop off rapidly as the altitude increases rapidly. The velocity
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 03:26 GET 3:50 Me 61/2
003:50:00|PAO|which at the translunar injection cutoff was around 35 000 feet per second down to about 22 000.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Can you see now on that quad? Is that what you're looking at?
|SC|Yeah, I'm looking right at it. And I got a good view of the MESA, top anyway, it's pretty well covered, but it looks all right also.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|All the antennas look good thruster quads all look great. I can see all four of them a minute ago.
|SC|Okay, about 10 feet there, Gene. Stand by for a barber pole.
|SC|MARK to G.
|SC|Ab out n ow .
|SC|Capture instant. Okay, we're free rates look p re 11 y good.
|SC|Let's lock it together.
|SC|Ready. She's lined up, not bad.
|SC|Go od.
|SC|Prime 1.
|SC|Mark it. Stand by.
|SC|Here she comes.
|SC|My gosh, Houston, we have a ripple fire, but we still have number 8 barber pole.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy.
|SC|We've got a master - got a master alarm.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|We got most of the latches but Ed barberpoled and B is great.
|SC|We checked both circuit breakers and they're both ok ay.
|SC|We had one clear fire, maybe one or two latches and then a ripple fire on the rest.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And by the way, I had a good view in the ADT and I can still look in there and it's very clean.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we saw your master alarm, did you have any thing on the matrix light up?
|SC|No, not a thing I looked.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|That appeared to be a repeat of the master alarm has been reported several times previously by the crew. They get the alarm light and tone, but when they look for the exact location of precise indication of what's wrong it's not there, indicating some sort spurious response by the master alarm to a problem that doesn't exist.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 0336CST 4:00 GET MC 62/1
004:00:00|SC|Okay, Bob. We're going to go ahead and take a look at that docking malfunction before we push on here further to check this barber pole out.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're looking some words up here. We'll be back with you in a second on that, Gene.
|SC|Okay, we're down on the checklist through the NES power breakers open.
|CAPCOM|Understand.
|SC|Houston, in case we'didn't tell you it's (garbled) barber pole.
|CAPCOM|Understand, we have it. - Say, Gene, we don t think its a problem - we'll find out what it is when they get in. We think we should just press right on with the pipeline check list and keep going.
|SC|Okay, we concur with that. Okay, we'll p ress on, Bob.
|SC|Okay, Bob. We just got our master alarm when I went to the retrack prime, from 1 to off.
|CAPCOM|I have to recopy that. Looks like panel 2 is jinx up there, huh.
|SC|Okay, up to the heater number 3 went to auto.
|CAPCOM|I have to recopy that.
|SC|Okay, Bob. We're reading the DELTA P of greater than 14 and I'm going to open the pressure equalization valve now.
|CAPCOM|Roger. 17, we copy that.
|SC|Okay, the DELTA P is coming down, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Dave, while you're watching that I just thought you'd be interested with the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 4:10 CST 03:46 MC 63/1
004:10:00|CAPCOM|Gene, while you're watching that, thought you'd be interested. We talked to some of our friends down at the Cape who watched the launch and they said you were aglow all the way until you faded into - you couldn't tell you from a star. They saw staging and they could just see you as a star way off in the distance until you faded out,, Not a cloud in the way at all.
|SC|Beautiful. Okay, we're at 2 and we're monitored in for 3 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And, Houston, while we're checking the integrity here, mag alpha Alpha, there's about 50 percent.
|CAPCOM|Mag alpha alpha, 50 percent. Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 12 minutes. The crew aboard Apollo 17 at this time pressing ahead with their preparations for separating the lunar module and command module, now docked together from the Saturn third stage. You heard some conversation earlier about an indication that all of the docking latches have not locked up. Now there are 12 of these latches in the docking mechanism, 6 of which are instrumented, and of the 6 that are instrumented, there was an indication that one of those may not have latched. However, we are confident that more than enough latches have locked up to assure a good solid dock, and for that reason the crew is pressing ahead with their preparations for separation.
|SC|Delta B change is less than .1
|CAPCOM|Three minutes and less than .1.
|SC|We are pressing on.
|CAPCOM|Rog, press.
|PAO|That report from Gene Cernan indicating that they have a good seal at the docking interface. Once the hatch is removed between the two vehicles, the crew will get a good look at all of those docking latches and they will be able to tell how many - if any of them didn't latch up. We're pushing ahead now for - for extracting the lunar module separating from the Saturn third stage at ground elapsed time of 4 hours 39 minutes.
|SC|Okay, cabin's at 4.8 now repress is about it.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Oh, not yet, it's still getting a little bit.
|SC|That repress valve is kind of noisy.
|SC|Repress is all through, we'll turn that off. Okay, Houston, the repress package is empty now and we're down to a Delta P of .2.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
|CAPCOM|And 17, just be advised, you're going to have S-IVB non-propulsal vent start 4:18:27, you've got about 3 minutes on that.
|SC|(Laughter) Okay, thank you.
|SC|Yeah, I'll get 'em.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 4:10 CST 03:46 MC 63/2
004:10:00|SC|Okay, Bob, we seem to be holding Delta P at about .2, I suspect that's probably zero.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
|SC|And the cabin pressure's about 4.5. You want us to wait till 5 psi for the emergency cabin pressure selects .
|CAPCOM|Negative on that, let's go ahead and just p re s s on .
|SC|Okay. They should be both. Okay emergency register working.
|SC|Coming down though Gene, let's wait till it gets cjown a little less.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|Yeah, straight up and down is both.
|SC|' Up on 1, must be the non-prop uls ive vent that's banging. (laughter) here goes - look at all the stuff glowing again.
|SC|It's really glowing.
|SC|Your non-propulsive vent gives quite a glow .
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|It looks like a rainbow.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 3:56 GET 4:20 64/1
004:20:00|SC|Prestressed package to fuel.
|SC|Now I take third string down a little bit. (Garble) a lot better about 400 ?
|SC|500 on the insertion. Now, they ought to be closed off by now I think. Yes.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Be advised, you don't have to wait until 5 psi cabin to go and open the hatch.
|SC|Okay, we're not viable. We're pressing on with it now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, it looks like we're going to maintain about 400 on the surge.
|SC|Goo d.
|SC|Okay, Houston. The hatch is coining out.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|(laughter) I don't know what you' re going to do with it.
|SC|Put it up here on the couch.
|SC|Therewego.
|SC|Hey this is a lot lighter than it used to be.
|SC|There's going to be a lot of happy people down there, Bob. I haven't checked them all, but visually they're all locked.
|CAPCOM|Understand, Gene, all of them are locked.
|SC|Let me give them a good check. ,
|SC|Yes, you'd better check them cause we got a barber pole on that one.
|SC|Yes, here's one that slipped over.
|SC|What is the position of it?
|SC|7 and (garble)
|SC|7 an d 9 ?
|SC|Hey, Bob. Maybe we aren't all going to be so h ap py .
|SC|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, 7, 9 and 10. The handle is flush, the bungee is vertical, but the handle is not locked down and a red button is showing and I can pull each one of them back slowly, I haven't done anything with them, that's 7, 9 and 10.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that. The handle is flush, the bungee is vertical, but the handle is not locked down and the red button is showing on 7, 9 and 10.
|SC|Check verb.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Bob, I just pushed the handle on 10 home a little bit and it did lock, and the red button is flush, so that leaves me 9 and 7.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 3:56 GET 4:20 64/2
004:20:00|CAPCOM|Uh, Geno, go ahead and try the handle on 9 and 7 and if that doesn't work, toggle and refire starting with 9 .
|SC|Okay, the handle, it doesn't work, I'll have to recock them.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|When you trip it do you cock it twice, does it take 2 cocks to make it go.?
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Okay, 9 cocked twice, it tripped. It is over center and locked.
|CAPCOM|Roger, how about the barber pole, now?
|SC|Okay, wait a minute, I'v got - barber pole main A circuit breakers are in and gone to retract and it's grey.
|SC|Aha, that did it ,
|CAPCOM|Ro g e r .
|SC|Okay, Bob. Cocked 7 twice and tripped it and it's over center and locked.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I think that takes care of them all.
|CAPCOM|Good show.
|SC|Okay, docking probe circuit breakers are out and extend retract is off. Does it belong on the probe? It's painted yellow and belongs on the probe.
|SC|Okay, Bob. The umbil icals are connected.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST4:06 GET 4:30 65/1
004:30:00|SC|Okay, Houston, 7 delta on the test meter Is now reading 1.0. It jumped up to 2.6 and it is now back to 1.0.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy. That's good.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 30 minutes. About 9 minutes from now the crew will be firing the pyrotechnic charges that separate the lunar module docked to the command module from the Saturn third stage, and springs will push the LM CSM back away from the launch vehicle at a rate of about 1 foot per second, and at ground elapsed time of 4 hours 52 minutes the launch vehicle will yaw to the proper attitude for an evasive manuever of about 10 feet per second to be performed at a ground elapsed time of about 5 hours 3 minutes. This will increase the separation difference to assure no chance of recontact between the booster and the spacecraft on route to the Moon. On removing the hatch between the LM, the CSM, allowing the crew to get a look inside the docking tunnel, they found that 3 of the 12 latches had not locked up, but on manually recocking them and activating them, they latched up properly, which indicates that there's nothing physically wrong with the system. We would expect that the next time the 2 vehicles come together to dock that the latches will function properly.
|SC|Pretty good (garble) service.
|SC|Ckay, Bob. The hatch is back in.
|CAPCOM|Roger, team.
|CAPCOM|15, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We've got some new angles here for you.
|SC|Stand by a minute and let me find a place to copy them. What kind of angles are they, Bob?
|CAPCOM|They're your noun 22 attitude manuever for APS burn out of the hatch window. They're in the middle of the page L3-5.
|SC|Oh , okay .
|CAPCOM|Instead of 2 70 we want 2 74.
|SC|Wait one, we're not quite with you.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, I think I might see it, 3-7 go.
|CAPCOM|It's on 3-5, Jack, middle of the page there. Those noun 22's.
|SC|Okay, I take it back, 3-5, middle of th e p age .
|CAPCOM|Okay, you notice there's 3 angles there, 2 70, make that 2 7 4.
|SC|Okay, now can we change?
|CAPCOM|And, no the next one, the 129-A, change
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 4:06 GET 4:30 65/21'
004:30:00|CAPCOM|that to 16 4, and 4.3 on the YAW, change that to 0, it's close enough, 0 on the yaw.
|SC|Okay, we got them 274 164 00.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and the high gain angles that you've got on the flight plan are close enough, and should do.
|SC|Ve ry good.
|PAO|Telemetry data now shows the crew load ing the information into the spacecraft digital auto pilot in preparation for separation from the Saturn third stage. That should be occurring in the next minute or so.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 04:16 CST 4:40 GET MC66/1
004:40:00|CAPCOM|That should be occurlng in the next minute or so.
|SC|Okay, we're 6 feet a second. Okay, wh at it cut in?
|SC|Range 1.
|SC|Yes, I'll leave it at 10 feet (garble).
|SC|Okay, Mode 1 and set,
|SC|Because I had the 0180 0.
|SC|Stand by. We're aligning our GDC and the next thing you'll pick up will be sector arm circuit breakers. We'll give you a call on the logic.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Okay, Bob, while we're waiting, balance on these I see what you mean.
|SC|2 and 02 flowing to fuel cell 3. Actually, in all 3 fuel cells look pretty good to you?
|CAPCOM|Jack, the flows look just right for the current.
|SC|Okay. Used to seeing them more or less ligned up and I hadn't calculated any farther than that.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|02 seemed a little higher H2, relatively s peaking.
|SC|Okay, that's pretty close. Verifies extra Arm breakers are closed.
|SC|Okay, Houston, we're ready to come up with the logi c.
|SC|Okay, Houston, logic 1 is coming on n ow an d logic 2 ,
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And Houston, just to keep track of GMS mobias check - that time was - went from 1 hundred to 1 hundred point 7 in a hundred seconds.
|CAPCOM|17, we'd like to just verify on that top line S-IVB LM sep circuit breakers. Both of them are closed?
|SC|Okay, we'll verify them again. we'double che eked them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we just didn't hear your call and want to make sure of that. Didn't want to miss anything, here.
|SC|Okay, they are verified closed and Jack just checked them again.

004:50:00|SC|Okay, do you want to look?
|SC|Yes, oh there it goes, there.
|SC|Looks kind of empty down there, Bob, without the LM we're looking right up the dome of the S-IVB.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy that. We re standing by for your GO for yaw manuever.
|SC|We can give them a GO for yaw, can t we. We c an see it.
|SC|Yes, you've got the GO on the yaw.
|CAPCOM|Roger, thank you, 17.
|SC|Looks like she came out of there clean as a whistle.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. The yaw manuever will be starting in about 4 plus 52, a little less than 2 minutes from n ow.
|SC|Okay. _
|CAPCOM|Sounds like you are taking a picture o that old dome out there, huh?
|SC|(laughter) Where'd1the empty -
|SC|Here, are you using1this?
|SC|Hey, there it goes,1look at the aft fire of the thing.
|SC|Yes, we can see it firing now,
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17. Yaw manuever started.
|PAO|The Saturn third stage now maneuvering into attitude for the APS evasive maneuver, a 10 foot per second burn using the auxiliary propulsion system that will assure -.
|SC|The flare wasn t dramatic, but it certainly did its job for us.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Preliminary data indicates that you are about as nominal as you can be.
|SC|That's the way we'd like to keep it, Bob.-
|CAPCOM|You'd better believe it.
|SC|Okay, she's - as we 1 re looking at it, she's pitching up, she was looking right at us, we were looking right at the dome and now she's pitching up. The shroud around the ID's seem to be totally intact. It looked like a super clean separation. I can t really see where there's any paint or anything externally chipped off the booster from here. We're beginning to pick up the (garble). It's really a shame you don't have this whole thing on TV, it's really quite a sight.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we concur with that.
|SC|The mylar and the gold coating on the inside of the shroud is now visible, it's also intact. It looks like you could use it again if you could get it
|CAPCOM|It's got a job to do when it hits the Moon yet.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 4:26 GET 4:50 67/2
004:50:00|SC|Okay, Bob,, We're almost looking at it broadside now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, she's spitting a little, looks like the yaw maneuver may be complete.
|SC|We got a full view of the entire J2 from here, and no kidding, Bob, the whole bird, the shroud at the top, the IU , the separation plane down by the S2 , from here looks just clean as a whistle, all the way.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene, if you're happy, we'd like a GO from you for the evasive burn.
|SC|Okay, you're going to burn on the boosters plus the X axis, is that right?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Let's just get a picture or 2 here yet, and then we'll give you a GO.
|CAPCOM|And Gene, it'll be about 7 minutes until the evasive burn, 5 plus 03.
|SC|Okay, you have a GO. And for your reference, it's frame 105, I started a few 250 millimeter pictures of the S-IVB.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|And Bob, the entire sky, as far as I can make it out through the hatch window is completely filled with our twinkling flakes.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
|SC|I saw a couple particles go by the window a while back, and it looked a little bit like insulation in that particular case, styrofoam insulation, but it's flat flakes.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that.
|SC|That was right after we separated.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 05:00 GET 04:36 CST 68/1

|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|SC|Bob, I know we're not the first to discover this, but we'd like to confirm from the crew of America that the world is round.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's a good data point. Have you gotten a good look at any of that weather down there on the Antarctic?
|SC|Ron's at window number 1, maybe he can tell you a little about it.
|EVANS|You know it's real funny there, at Antarctica the - you can see the snow but there isn't any weather at all. All of the weather's around it in the water.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|That's where the moisture is.
|SC|I don't know what to think of (garble).
|SC|Can't see the U.S. at all.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Look's like you've got a super conservative CMP up there, we've run off some numbers, looks like you used about 40 pounds of RCS on the T and D and you've used about a total of 42 pounds RCS total, so we're hanging right in there, b e auti f ul.
|SC|Very fine, glad to here that.
|SC|Still a little bit too much, but that's not bad. We'll be glad to leave all that extra, I hope, in the service module when we get home.
|SC|It's in the Volkswagen pouch down there.
|SC|No, I'll change lens now.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, it's about 30 seconds from the Evasive Maneuver Burn.
|SC|Okay. Here Jack, can you see it good?
|SC|Check the lens now. I took an F-22 stop.
|SC|There is goes, Bob.
|SC|There is goes, finally.

005:10:00|CAPCOM|Sounds like a winner, Gene.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|I guess you saw that one, Houston. That had no caution or warning with it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that master alarm?
|SC|Yes, sir.
|CAPCOM|How about the LEB?
|SC|(Garble) Ha. You caught me. I forgot to look. Keep after us, we'll get you that data for you.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Gene's got his hands all over panel 2, which probably would have caused it.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we think that might have been a real one, due to the accumulator cycle with the 02 makeup flow going on there, held the 02 flow little higher for a - greater than 16 seconds.
|SC|Well, that's certainly a possibility. we'didn't notice it looked upright at the time. But it- - sure that was the right time.
|CAPCOM|Well, we're kindly watching it here and (garble) feels it is.
|SC|Gee, I can't argue with him.
|SC|Okay, Houston, ready to deactivate the primary evaporator if you concur.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Jack we concur.
|SC|Okay, Bob. VHF simplex, ALFA's off.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And we're gradually moving in to getting out of th e s uit s .
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I bet you're looking forward to that.
|SC|Well, I'll tell you it's a different world without that old 1-G on you. The old suit's a little bit friendlier.
|SC|And, as you may have noticed, Bob, we've come to the end of the launch checklist.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, and we've put ours away for posterity. We also started with our TLI zero data that we worked so hard to generate.
|SC|Well, I'm just happy - didn't - use it. That view of the earth for a rev there was something I was looking forward to and was not disappointed.
|CAPCOM|That's great, Jack.
|SC|Bob, you've got a pretty good size storm over the north. I guess the northwestern coast of India, where It starts to wrap up around to the west. It's around out on the horizon, so I can't make out exactly where it is too well.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Could we get a readout on the LM, CM Delta P?
|SC|Plus .4.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
|SC|Bob, Antarctica is what I would call effectively just a solid white cap down on the -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 5:20 GET 04:56 CST 70/1
005:20:00|SC|White cap down on the South Pole. There's definite contact between the continent and the water, but as Ron said most of the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque, some in clockwise rotating fashion but appear to be very thin when you can for the most part kind of see through those clouds the blue water below.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The continent itself is the same color as the clouds but of course, more, dense in a striking difference than any of the other white background around, because you can definitely see that contact with the water and with the clouds over the water.
|CAPCOM|Rog, understand. There'll be a comm switch over to Madrid here shortly, may break lock here in a few minutes here. Or a few seconds, really.
|CAPCOM|And you might watch your accumulator's going to cycle in about 20 seconds here, see what happen with the master alarm.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, how do you read through Madrid?
|SC|You're loud and clear, Bob, and could you give us our distance from the Earth?
|CAPCOM|Rog, I'm looking at the board, I'd guess at about 19 000 miles, want me to get it exact?
|SC|Just approximate's good enough.
|CAPCOM|18 100, Fido says.
|SC|Okay, and I suppose we're seeing as 100 per cent full Earth as we'll ever see, certainly as I've ever seen, it appears to be — it may be a little bit — a little bit of a terminator, way out to the well to the East out beyond Australia and beyond India, but beyond that it's about 99 percent pure.
|SC|Bob, it's these kind of views - these kind of views that stick with you forever.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|We've got a I guess probably the continent of Africa dominates the world right now, it's covering oh the upper third - upper western third of the world. We can see the Sinai, we can see up into the Mediterranean, we can see across the Mediterranean although we can't quite make out the countries up there, we can see across into India. I can catch a glimpse of Australia out in the far horizon. Got Zanzibar on the southern tip of Africa, the cape down there just almost directly below us. And, I don't know exactly how bit Antarctica is but I guess we can certainly see more than 50 percent of it. And - the rest of it is all ocean. The Indian Ocean out into the Pacific Ocean back into the Atlantic Ocean and for the most part relatively clear of clouds except in the Antarctica region, and up towards Europe which is - which is on the horizon, across the Mediterranean it looks like there might be some clouds back up in that way. I Probably - probably - well not probably I can make out the entire coast of Africa from Mediterranean around to the west on back to the south back where it takes it's big dip to the east, back around the cape, back around up through the Suez Canal; almost perfect ly.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we understand.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 5:20 GET 04:56 CST 70/2
005:20:00|SC|And there's one batch of clouds that in northern Africa, just a small batch, it looks like it may be up near the - well no it's not near the mouth of the Nile it's quite a bit west of that, as a matter of fact, I can see the mouth of the Nile, I can see it running straight down towards us as it parallels the Suez and then sort of fades out into the central darker brown or darker green portions of Africa.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. Sure would be nice to have that on TV wouldn't it?
|SC|Oh, I'd love to give it to you, any way I could.
|SC|You know, there's no strings holding it up either, it's out there all by itself.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I just was going through the 17 status report on the CSM systems and boy everything is absolutely nominal with the exception of as glitching master alarm that we're trying to still track down but every other system is just nominal, everything is great.
|SC|Okay, sounds good, that's the way they built i t fo r us.
|CAPCOM|Gene, looking at our plot board, you're directly over the southern tip of Africa, or just slightly out in the Indian Ocean there according to our plot board which isn't exactly accurate at all times. But shortly you're gonna start going backwards on the Earth here and head back across the Atlantic, that ought to be some sort of a first; you cross the Atlantic twice, going from west to east, and now you're going to cross it going from east to west here shortly. All in a very short span of time.
|SC|Yeah, I guess that does sound like a first.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72, CST 5:06, GET 5:30, 71/1
005:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time. The white team of flight controllers, headed by Gene Krantz, is in the process now, of handing over to the team headed by flight director Pete Frank. After 12 hours, the team came on about 3 hours prior to the scheduled launch time of 8:53 PM Central Standard Time. Of course, launch occurred 2 hours 40 minutes late at a ground elapsed time of 11, — of a Central Standard Time rather, 11:33 PM. As a result of the late launch-time the trans-lunar injection, that's up through translunar injection, also slipped 2 hours, 40 minutes. We would expect that the translunar injection which is targeted to make up the difference will get us back on the nominal flight plan time by the time the spacecraft arrives at the Moon. In other words, arrival time at the Moon would be at the same Central Standard Time as called for in the Flight Plan at about 1:49 PM Central Standard Time, December 10. But, the Ground Elapsed Time would be about 2 hours, 40 minutes earlier than that provided for in the Flight Plan, the arrival being at about 86 hours, 14 minutes ground elapsed time. The 2 hour, 40 minute difference being accounted for in a speedier arrival time at the Moon, a translunar injection burn being targeted just slightly longer than would have been the case in a normal launch. The spacecraft getting to the Moon in a total elapsed time 2 hours 40 minutes less, in effect, making up for lost time from the late launch, In order to get the flight plan back in agreement with the ground elapsed time the GET, or ground elapsed clock, will simply be moved ahead 2 hours, 40 minutes between now and the time spacecraft arrives at the Moon. So, that by the time Apollo 17 is inserted into Lunar Orbit, the GET will once again agree with the flight plan GET and of course, the Central Standard Time of arrival will be the same as was originally planned by virtue of a speedier trip time. As a result of the late liftoff it was not possible to program television coverage of the transposition and docking. This was because of a shift in the orbital ground track moving the ground track away from the needed Manned Spaceflight network coverage for television. We simply didn't have an adequate ground station to receive the television signal from the spacecraft. There has been one recurring problem that is yet unexplained. That is in the displays and control system. The crew reported on several occassions that master alarm was occurring. The master alarm manifests itself in a form of a light that flashes in the Command Module. There are three of these lights and also a tone that comes on and a normal procedure is when the master alarm light comes on and the tone sounds, the crew then looks at another matrix of lights to determine precisely where the problem is. However, when looking at this matrix of lights none of them were lighted, indicating that some spurrious signal had ignited or lighted the master alarm light and that there was in fact no problem in the systems. There is at this point no explanation for the problem. However, engineers here in the Control Center, are looking into the past history of 12' which is the panel on which a number of switches are locate , which have triggered this master alarm to see if there is a history of panel 2 that would indicate a possibility of some momentary short in the caution and warning system, which could give a master alarm. Apollo at this point is an annoyance, but does not appear to be a serious problem. All other spacecraft systems are performing normally, and the trajectory to the Moon is almost precisely as planned at this point. we'do not antici pate a change of shift press briefing. The white team w*3-! be coming back on at the regualar Central Standard Time 4:00 PM tomorrow. And in light of this rather short turn around we re going to forego the change of shift press briefing. t lours, 36 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 05:14 CST 5:38 GET MC72/1
005:38:00|SC|Bob, this is Jack here. We've got a UCTA dump scheduled, is possible at 6 o'clock. There's nothing secret about that tine is there?
|CAPCOM|Nothing at all. When ever you are ready, just go ahead and dump.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Bob, one of the things that we miss in our training is a good geography lesson and particularly on Anarticia. I got the binocular out and apparently the dark band that Gene - Ron mentioned and interfaced between the intercontinental water is that between the pack ice and the water and you can - by very subtle changes in the various movements of the ground probably make out where the actual continent begins and the pack ice ends. There are a few exposed ranges. I guess it's mid summer down there now and you can make out the snow free areas scattered at least in the northern portion of the continent.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Did you get any pictures of that, Jack ?
|SC|Oh yes. We got some pictures earlier. I'm going to get another one here in a minute. I'll tell you, if there ever was a fragile appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|There, we got a master alarm.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SC|And there's one in the LEB.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good data point.
|SC|And there are no caution lights.
|CAPCOM|It came right at an accumulator cycle along with the high 02 flow again.
|SC|Yes, I just checked the time and I think you are right on that one. But we gave you your LEB data p oin t .
|CAPCOM|Yes, sir.
|SC|The problem with looking at the Earth - particularily Anarticia, is that it is too bright.
|CAPCOM|I understand.
|SC|And so I'm using my sunglasses through the binoculars, which is not the best viewing platform. I think I can see some of the areas of the Dry Valley but again I'm not too sure of my geography, Bob. There are clouds over the continent, I believe. But, of course, they are just as white as the snow and you only see differences in texture brought out by - probably by varying photometric return because of fairly low sun angles down there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 05:14 CST 5:38 GET MC72/2
005:38:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|But you can see patterns of, what I believe is, pack ice leading off from that sharp interface that was talked about earlier. And those patterns seem to merge directly with the patterns of the clouds as if the -at least near the continent - the oceananic currents are controlling the air currents up to a point along with the movement of the pack ice.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I'm distinguishing the pack ice from clouds mainly by the angularity of the patterns within them. There is no good clear color or albedo distinction. So, I could be looking entirely at clouds but I suspect there are some pack ice patterns too. I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?
|CAPCOM|No sir. Just keep talking. We're listening. I'm sure not much of the world is listening but this will all be recorded and you can read it all when you get back. And think it through and tie it up with the pictures and I'm sure there's going to be people interested in this. And we're interested ourselves, so just keep t alkin g.
|SC|All I want: to do is read what I say,
|CAPCOM|Rog. If I had a little more geology training I'd be asking you some better questions. Right now, I can't think of any to ask you.
|SC|Well I can't - I really wish I knew geography. I don't know - I wish I'd thought of bringing a good map of Anartica. Could somebody do a little researching for me and see if they could tell me if we're to have a little American view - say on the eastern edge of the continent?
|CAPCOM|Rog. We'll see if we can get some Anartica geographers around.
|SC|Yes, I'd like to- and alsowhether or not they think the Dry Valley area - if this will do it. Could be - there's some people over there in Bill Petty's group I think have a little Ariartic experience, or used to. They might be able to help you out.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'll see what we can track down on i t .
|SC|Don't use up a lot of people's time on it but -
|CAPCOM|Roger. It's getting pretty empty around here. It's 5 in the morning.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 04:14 CST 5:38 GET MC72/3
005:38:00|SC|Okay. There is a good strong northern hemisphere cyclone up near India. And I think Gene mentioned that. It, I think, was one I saw in some of the forecast sheets as a dissipating hurricane or typhoon. I'm not sure which it is there. I guess it is a typhoon. And I see something here that I noticed in Earth orbit, Bob. That as you approach the terminator - now I'm looking at the Eastern terminator. Have to keep all my directions straight here. Yes, eastern terminator. The clouds - those associated with the cyclone over India and one that's -- appears to be due south of there maybe 30 degrees of latitude have a gray appearance. Instead of the brilliant white of other clouds. As you approach the terminator those - at least the high level clouds are gray. Now, when we were going over them in orbit the lower level clouds were still white and I think I can see a head of that right now. That sun gives a strong light reflection off of the -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 5:37 GET 5:56 73/1
005:56:00|SC|The sun gives a strong light reflection off of the buildup in the low level clouds, whereas the high level and normally layered appearance, and maybe some of the intermediate level stratus get to look gray, because of grazing sun I suspect.
|CAPCOM|Roger. You mentioned several things on this orbit that kind of Intrigued me, you mentioned seeing the rainbow, and we were trying to figure out how you saw a rainbow up there, and you were in orbit already at that time. Do you remember that?
|SC|Well, we were speaking of the merits of th e s unri s e.
|CAPCOM|Okay that's -
|SC|That's having a banded color appearance that varied as you approached the sunrise. I can't remember what we - I think we. put some of that on tape, we were probably LOS at the time, but the banded character of the sunrise in the atmosphere was very very marked. There was a gray—blue upper layer that merged or graded into a brilliant blue intermediate zone that was just above the cloud level and within the clouds, you got an orange to yellow band getting more yellow as the sun rose, that was broken by the dark patterns of the buildup.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Good show.
|SC|The interesting thing was the continual glow on the horizon, we had even at night. On the darkside pass, and that glow was in the atmosphere because I could see stars rise over the horizon in It and then pass on through i t.
|CAPCOM|Roger. You were talking, the air glow low I guess is the phenomenon most interesting thing before us. Kind of interesting.
|SC|Yes, that's right, it's I guess standard air glow, but it is very striking and it's a continuous thing even in the dark pass.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I think I did see the eastern tip of South America now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, you're starting to backup now, coming the other way, so you're still over Africa according to our chart here, but you're backing up towards South Ame rIca.
|SC|Yes, I can see the part on South America that mercator thought that fit in with the bend in Africa some many decades ago and started people thinking about moving continents around on the crust.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Jack, how'd the PGA doffing go? Are you all out of the PGA's now?
|SC|That's been worked. We're taking it slow and easy up here, Bob.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 5:32 GET 5:56 73/2
005:56:00|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|SC|I'll just be curious to see if they all fit in that bag.
|SC|I think you'll find that Ronald Evans will also be curious about that. He's already made comments.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours. As Jack Schmitt gives the description of the earth, Apollo 17 is 22 86 8 nautical miles from earth velocity 12 520 feet per s e con d.
|SC|We certainly do have a very clear intuitive impression although the evidence is hard to put together that the frontal drifts that move off the Anarctic continent do not take on any well defined characters until they get into the moist regions of the ocean, and when they do they seem to pick up an -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 06:00 GET 05:36 CST 74/1
006:00:00|SC|- character until they get into the voice regions of the ocean and when they do, they seem to pick, up an arculate circulation that in the view we have seem to get fairly spaced cyclones patterns that lie between the Cape of Good Hope and northern portion of Anarctica and these certain circulations of cyclones follows roughly an east/west pattern and the curve - the arcs of the fronts are more north/south than let's say northwest swinging around to the south.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|All of them - all of them very nicely defined as southern hemisphere cyclones. There are about 4 of those v^sible swinging around oh I guess that's latitude I'm having to uess here but I'd say latitude 50 to 60 South.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 50 or 60 South then huh?
|SC|Yeah, I'd have to look at the map here in a minute see if that puts me between Anarctica and the Cape.
|CAPCOM|. Roger.
|CAPCOM|Well, the tip of Africa there is about 32 South.
|SC|Well, that sounds like a pretty good guess. It look like the intertropical convergence zone over Africa is starting to get more and more clouds in it now, I suspect as midday approaches, which is what we're seeing there, we can expect to see more and more moisture indications.
|CAPCOM|Rog, they're probably about noontime right there right now, it's 11:36 at the zero meridian at Greenwich so it's just a little bit before noon right in that area you're talkin g ab out.
|SC|Yeah, some of those masses of what I suspect are cumulus build ups, well not really, they don't look they're as concentrated and localized. More like just masses of fairly dense clouds that are developing in that band of green, that crosses the lower portion of Africa.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Stay tuned for the next installment on the Earth, I'll try and get out of this suit.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just take it easy Jack, and we'll be 1 is t enin g.
|SC|Man, I've never taken it so easy in my life, I'll tell you Bob, I couldn't believe this would be an experience like it is now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Everytime you turn around there is something else to see and wonder what's causing it. Whether it's a particle zipping across the window or one zipping across the cabin or springs mechanics here in zero-g; there's always something going on.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 7 minutes No midcourse correction number 1 will be performed. The value of the maneuver that would be required is less than 3 feet per second and midcourse correction number 1 will not be performed by Apollo 17. The spacecraft is now 23 6 82 nautical miles from
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 06:00 GET 05:36 CST 74/2
006:00:00|PAO|Earth, velocity 12 301 feet per second.
|SC|Bob, if I'm not waking you up an observer from another planet certainly — probably could decide that we have such things as clouds at least large thunder storms because right at the terminator you get a brightening of the Sun lit side and a long, long shadow out to the out to the east that is reminiscent of what we saw in the early days looking at the Moon at the terminator.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 5:46 GET 6:10 75/1
006:10:00|SC|That is reminiscent of what we saw in the early days looking at the Moon at the terminator,
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|However, in the next pass around, I'll bet you wouldn't see them.
|SC|I've never been a big - well, I didn't grow up with the idea of drifting continents and sea floor spreadings, but I tell you, when you look at the way the pieces of the northeastern portion of the African continent seem to fit together separated by a narrow gulf, you could almost make a believer of anybody.
|CAPCOM|Roger, it's beginning to look like the globe that you might buy down at the store, huh?
|SC|Oh, I don't think so Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|I don't think we'd better put this one up for sale. Somewhere there might be somebody that would like to b uy it.
|CAPCOM|Say, Jack. We noticed the 02 flow has dropped down now. We're wondering, did you all close the waste storage vent valve.
|SC|I don't think so, let me check on that. It might have gotten closed inadvertently in the game we were playing down in the LAB.
|SC|Ron says it's still on vent.
|CAPCOM|It's on vent, Roger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're noticing that the flow is coming back up slowly so something caused it to drop, and it's coming back up.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Jack, just to ease those words I said before, we looked at the schematics here a second and you've been dumping urine out of that same line as that waste vent, and that would probably cause the pressure to build up enough to slow the 02 flow, and we notice that the 02 flow is climbing back up to where it belongs.
|SC|Well, that's clever. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Didn't mean to worry you there, shouldn't have said it, I guess before we looked at the s chemat i cs.
|SC|Oh, I really hadn't started to worry about it yet, Bob, so no sweat.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72, CST 5:06, GET 5:30, MC-75A/1
005:30:00|SC|Bob, I can assume that from what you said there will probably not be a midcourse 1.
|CAPCOM|That's exactly what we're working towards, Gene. And I'm sorry I didn't convey that feeling to you a little earlier. There's no reason for midcourse 1 right now.
|SC|Okay, because we prefer to press on and get the suits off and hit the sack, rather than making them, unless w e h ave t o.
|CAPCOM|That's for sure. Roger. The earlier data showed us midcourse 1 would have been less on 3 feet per second and we wouldn't have done it. And the data's been fluctuating. And they're smoothing it: out and it's still holding that way, so we won't be doing it probably.
|SC|Okay. Very good.
|SC|Bob, I'm looking over Gene's shoulder here at the Earth and it must be an awful clear day for the so called convergence zone across Africa. Gene I think indicated that when we crossed it earlier, most of Africa is clear. Only some, probably broken, scattered clouds cumulus in the east central portion that are running on the lines of north south lines.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Looks like a major circulation system off the southern tip of Africa as Gene mentioned, plus one west of that, 20 or 30 degrees of longitude. Make that east of that.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And, southwest of - make that south, southwest of the tip of Africa at Cape Good Hope, there looks like an insi-pient circulation system developing about half way between the Coast of Anartica and Africa. If I had to guess, it's going to swing up north toward the Cape and then swing west. The whole pattern, looks like now a fairly equally spaced cyclones that are sort of circling aroung the Anartic continent and we can see it now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|I would guess that South Africa is going to have good weather for several more days at least. And if the pattern is apparent the clouds we see are correct the last disturbance I mentioned probably is going to pass down to the Cape also.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Understand.
|SC|As we were going over our daylight around the earth in our orbit, it was very clear looking at the various clouds, Bob, what were high clouds and what were low clouds, particularly when you have them together. High clouds carry very distinct shadow patterns on the lower ones and very commonly had entirely different orientations, pattern orientations. The low ones seem to be more associated with (garble) front patterns, whereas, the high clouds were generally transverse to that roughly north south directions. That's not completely general observation, but I noticed it several times.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72, CST 5:06, GET 5:30, MC-75A/2
005:30:00|CAPCOM|I just noticed on the blackboard here, it looks like you've come up on 20 000 miles out right about now.
|SC|It feels like about 20000, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 06:20 GET 05:56 CST 76/1
006:20:00|SC|How'd the S-IVB work go, Bob?
|CAPCOM|It just finished the second burn and it's targeted right where they want it. Just working perfectly.
|SC|Where were they going to put that one, I guess I lost track of that?
|CAPCOM|Seven degrees south and 8 degrees west, Jack.
|SC|Say again, you cut out of the first.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 7 degrees south and 8 degrees west.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|That ought to be interesting.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 24 minutes. The S-IVB maneuver that was just being discussed was performed with the auxiliary propulsion system; just completed Delta V of 13 feet per second to tune up the trajectory for S-IVB impact at the desired location on the lunar surface of 7 degrees south, 8 degrees west. That's approximately 200 kilometers of the Apollo 14 ALSEP site where the seismometer is located. That impact is expected to be picked up by the other seismometers on the Moon, the other Apollo lunar surface experiment seismometers. Booster systems engineer is now maneuvering the S-IVB stage, the third stage of the launch vehicle to a solar heat control attitude. This is to minimize the heat into the instrument unit. They will then track the stage for a considerable length of time and determine whether another corrective burn will be required. At 6 hours 25 minutes into the mission, this is Mission Control, Houston.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours 27 minutes. Booster systems engineer has just reported to the Flight Director that the S-IVB stage is in good shape, with 14 hours life time remaining. The limiting factor on the S-IVB is the battery life. Fourteen hours of battery life remaining on the S-IVB.
|SC|Hello, Houston, how do you read CDR?
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, Gene.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Bob, LMP's going off the air for a little while.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|It sounded like a kind of a sigh of relief.
|CAPCOM|No sir. Been enjoying listening to you, keep me awake down here.
|SC|You had a long day.
|CAPCOM|Not as long as you've had.
|SC|I've been lying around, floating around.
|CAPCOM|You make it sound so good.

|SC|Houston, Apollo 17,
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|Okay, we had another master alarm and I just glanced up and it was the main A undervolt light that was on just for a second.
|CAPCOM|Okay - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 06:16 CST 6:40 GET MC78/1
006:40:00|SC|Just for a second.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we'didn't see anything at all on main A down here. we'did have accumulator cycle again? Don't know if that ties it or not.
|SC|Well, the main A Interval - I just happened to be looking at the panel and the main A interval light flicked on for a second. And of course, obviously, main A is up now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston, here. We've checked the back room and the high speed charts and that and don't see any glitch on main A at all on our data down here.
|SC|Okay, Bob.
|PAO|This is Apollo Controll. It's 6 hours 49 minutes. Apollo 17 is 2 8 2,32 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 11 291 feet per second. We're continuing to operate at present on the normal GET of the flight plan, normal ground elapsed time. Under that schedule the crews rest period will begin about 9 hours and 15 minutes into the mission. If, however, the crew completes the activities that are scheduled in the flight plan early the rest period will probably begin early if they so desire. However, at the present time we are continuing to operate on the GET of the flight plan. At 6 hours 50 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.

007:40:00|SC|Houston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Roger, go 17.
|SC|That little master alarm there, I can't be absolutely positive, but out of the corner of my eye I think it was the suit compressor light that glitched.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. We believe down here that it was the high 02 flow.
|SC|Well, they're pretty close, I thought it was red and I thought - okay that's good. That's the right time I guess.
|CAPCOM|Okay, cause we'd just called it out just 5 seconds before you called.
|SC|Very good Doctor.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and Tony is back in Houston on th e cons ole.
|SC|That's hard to believe, what are you doing back there. We haven't even had time to go to sleep?
|CAPCOM|Well, I tell you, it's a tale that's hard to believe, it's almost as miraculous as your escape from the pad tonight.
|SC|Did you enjoy the launch?
|CAPCOM|Beautiful.
|SC|You've seen 1 night launch you've seen them all, huh Parker?

|SC|Houston 17, have you got the torqing an g le s yet.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Okay, we have them and you're GO to torque them.
|SC|Okay, I'm going to torque at 58 10.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours 58 minutes. Ron Evans is realigning the inertial platform that was scheduled on the flight plan for 8 hours 15 minutes. That indicates that they are running 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the flight plan. Jack Schmitt is obviously taking some pictures. He gave Bob Parker a report on a film magazine that he was using.
|SC|(garble)
|CAPCOM|And 17, we have a preferred REFSMMAT standing by if you want to give us ACCEPT and we'll send it up before you do your second P 52.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 7:14 GET 7:40 83/2
007:40:00|SC|Okay, you have POO and ACCEPT now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, on the up data, it's coming in now. And Ron, while we're sending it up to you, we'll also send you an update on the 0 trunnion bias as per the flight plan .

|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston, over.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Rog. We've been discussing the question of what your frequency is going to be in terms of headset or not with reference to all of these various master alarms, and I guess we'd feel better if one of you guys slept with his headset on. We were curious as to what your plans are.
|SC|Bob, since I've got to wear the bio net anyway, I might just as well go ahead and keep it on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the other option is for us, if we're trying to get hold of you is to put the klaxon on but we re a little un in favor of that because of the possibility one of these spurious things waking everybody up that way.
|SC|Yeah, I'll go ahead and keep it on andsee how that works out, for a while.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. And, when you guys are ready we have a couple of - we have 3 items to read up to you for the updates of the flight plan.
|SC|Okay , go ahead Bob .
|CAPCOM|Okay, the first's in the flight plan itself and it's the quads for the spin up and they'll be alpha and B ravo.
|SC|Okay for PGC spin up quads and Alpha and Bravo.
|CAPCOM|All right, we just took that back. It should be Bravo and Delta for spin up Alpha and Bravo only for damping. Copy Bravo and Delta for spin up Alpha and Bravo for damping.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72, CST 7:50, GET 8:17, MC-86/1
008:17:00|SPEAKER|As soon as you have that I have two others one in Flight Plan Supplement Book, and the other one is in the GNC Checklist.
|SC|Okay. Go with the supplement.
|CAPCOM|Okay. On the Flight Plan Supplement we have an E-load update. On page 1-43, say 1-43, give me a call when you get to that page.
|SC|Okay, B ob . I' m there.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Un de r line it's 30704, c olumn Bravo, you fine currently 33550. And let me give you a word of warning. When we change this, we'll be changing this again around 67 hours. These are primarily due to the launch delay. And we'll give you another GET update of this sort later on. The new number to replace - -
|SC|Bob,
|CAPCOM|Go ahead. Let me get a pencil please - -
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|I just have a pen.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Under - - Again 1 remind you 30704 column BRAVO was 33550 is now 34761. The line just below it which is 05 also in column BRAVO is 15403. Over.
|SC|Okay, Bob. For 30704 BRAVO 34761, and for 31005 BRAVO 15403.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Very good. The next one is in the GNC Checklist under the T-37 block data. To help you find it, that's on page 4-23.
|SC|Okay. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. On the liftoff plus 15, your first block is 01500, 3893, minus 174, 05756. The second block from liftoff 125 is 05 - pardon me, start over again there. 02500, 6651, minus 175 , 05 725 , over.
|SC|Okay, Houston, Apollo 17. First one would be 01500, Delta V will be 3893, minus 174, and GET 400 K is 05756. The other one is Tig of 02500, Delta-V is 665 1 longitude, minus 175, GET of 400 K is 05725.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Good readback.
|SC|Okay Bob. This is Jack. I'm going to be moving into the presleep checklist here. Are there any things you want to change or alter in that? Are you ready for the waste storage vent to be closed?
|CAPCOM|Roger 17, we're ready for the vent valve to closed, waste storage vent to close. And we have no anticipated changes at the present time in the flight plan, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I was just looking at 1-29 in the pre sleep checklist, and wondering if there was anything there.
|CAPCOM|Standby Jack.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72, CST 7:50, GET 8:17, MC-86/2
008:17:00|CAPCOM|Okay, 17. For antenna management tonight, we1d like you to select OMNI BRAVO at the current time and stow the higb-gain antenna and we'll take care of managing antennas froi here on,
|SC|Okay. We'll give you OMNI BRAVO and stow the high-gain.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, we indeed do not have anything to add to the presleep checklist tonight.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|And with your concurrence I'll take the H2 band to auto now.
|CAPCOM|Roger we're ready for that all to auto.
|CAPCOM|Okay, - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 8:00 CST 8:27 GET MC87/1
008:27:00|CAPCOM|Jack, I guess that - we' re not sure what you said or meant there or what. In the flight plan, itself, we want H2 heaters and 1 and 2 to AUTO and we want H2 fans on tank 3 only, AUTO. There - 3 there for H2 tank 3.
|SC|Okay, you're teaching me to read carefully early, aren't you?
|CAPCOM|We 're t^ing. The 1 and 2 heaters will be on AUTO and 3 fan will be on AUTO.
|SC|That's the way it is now and consider the fans have been cycled.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|According to the checklist.
|SC|You might look at the third line on 1-29 and look at the H2 line on the flight plan and see why I was confused.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We were just discussing whether or not there was a fan or fans in each tank.
|SC|That ought to keep you awake this morning.
|CAPCOM|Did I say something?
|SC|What I was really trying to do, Bob, was getting out. of chlorinating the portable water but you wouldn't bite.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours 28 minutes. Apollo 17 now 37 thousand 8 hundred 32 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 9 thousand 6 hundred 67 feet per second. Apollo 17 crew in the period now in the flight plan where they're making preparations for their rest period. Getting the systems in the proper configuration for a sleep period. The spacecraft has been maneuvered to the passive thermal control or PTC mode - attitude, rather. And just prior to the rest period the crew will spin up the spacecraft for thermal control during the rest period. The spin rate will be slow or approximately 3 revolutions of the spacecraft per hour but it will keep the thermal balance on the spacecraft. At 8 hours 30 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston,
|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston. Over, Jack.
|SC|Go ahead. Over, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We're going to give you a little high-gain antenna practice here. We'd like to pick up with the high-gain antenna again so that we can get your PTC -watch your PTC develop. We'd like you to go to a pitch of AO and yaw of 2 75 on the high-gain. That's 40 pitch; 275 yaw; and manual on wide. Over.
|SC|81 on the high gain selected, I presume.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 08:00 CST 8:27 GET MC87/2
008:27:00|SC|Now that helps, too.
|SC|You got it.
|SC|Roger. Our apology.
|SC|Oh, I don't expect that will be the last time you have to apologize. I think we're running about even, n ow.
|SC|You're missing quite a view, Bob. Sorry you1re not here.
|CAPCOM|That makes two of us.
|CAPCOM|Dwight just said, "That makes three of us".
|SC|What are you trying to tell me?
|CAPCOM|Look out.
|SC|Who's your friend off on your right tonight ?
|CAPCOM|Wally Moon, would you believe?
|SC|Say it again.
|CAPCOM|Wally Moon.
|SC|Oh, a Moon, huh?
|SC|Why don't you ask him what he's reading at H2 tank 3 quantity?
|CAPCOM|Okay. I'm asking him
|SC|In percent.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17. Now in tank 3 of H2 we're reading 84:38.
|SC|Okay, it looks like we're reading almost the same now days.
|CAPCOM|Good.
|SC|I know we launched a little bias but I guess that's gone now. We're a little higher than that.
|CAPCOM|And 17, Houston. We're seeing your rates are quite low enough to start spinning up to PTC.
|SC|Okay, we'll see if we can't get it right this time.

|SC|Does it make any difference with the plus or minus roll there now that you are going to use the high gain?
|CAPCOM|Okay, the Flight Plan says minus roll, why don't we'do it that way.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|After you start the roll 17, we'd like to go back to omni bravo and stow the high gain.
|SC|Okay
|CAPCOM|We only need the high gain to keep a good check on your rates .
|CAPCOM|And 17, that means stow the high gain after you - after the start up, we'd like to watch the start up itself.
|SC|Okay, I was just going to ask you when.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17 we're ready for high gain to stow and select omni bravo.
|SC|Okay .

|SC|Okay, go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Could you give us your 02 heater con figuration?
|SC|Okay, we've got 1 and 2 in AUTO and 3 is OFF.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like those per the flight plan, 1 and 2 to OFF and 3 to AUTO.

|CAPCOM|Roger, Apollo 17, we copy the film update and we're ready for you to go to sleep once you got the LiOH canister changed if you haven't, and remember also the charge on battery Bravo. After that it's just the comm configuration, squelch enable and voice OFF, when you get ready to go to sleep.

009:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours 26 min utes. The Booster Systems Engineer has advised Flight Director Pete Frank that a second midcourse correction for the S-IVB, the third stage of the launch vehicle will be required. This maneuver is performed with the auxiliary propulsion system of the S-IVB, and the Booster Systems Engineer will command this burn at 11 hours 15 minutes ground elapsed time. The magnitude of the burn is not known at this time. That will be determined shortly before the midcourse is performed. The purpose is to tune up the trajectory to more precisely target the S-IVB stage to the desired impact point on the lunar surface. Tracking to this point of the spacecraft indicates that a midcourse correction will probably be performed for the spacecraft at the scheduled midcourse number 2 time at 35 hours and 30 minutes. A preliminary look - that's a very early look shows it to be about 10-1/2 feet per second, but that will be refined as we get closer to the time. At 9 hours 27 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.

But we'do have indications that they have not yet fully configured the spacecraft for their rest period. Normally the voice switch is turned off the last step before the rest period. That voice switch is still on. Apollo 17 now 43 261 nautical miles away from Earth, velocity 8964 feet per second.

009:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours 48 minutes. From the data that he is receiving, the Flight Surgeon, Dr. Sam Pool, reports that tie believes the spacecraft Commander Gene Cernan is asleep. Cernan is the only member of the crew who is wearing the biomedical harness during the rest period, and therefore, is the only one that the flight surgeon is getting measurements on. But the indications are that Cernan is asleep and apparently the entire crew has gone to sleep. Apollo 17 now 44 749 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 8794 feet per second. The awake clock as operating in the Control Center shows wake up for the crew in 5 hours 10 minutes 37 seconds.
|PAO|This is Apolio Control at 9 hours 59 minutes. The Flight Dynamics Officer, Bill Boone, has computed the half way marks for the spacecraft in both time and distance. We'll give those to you now. Apollo 17 will reach the half way point in distance at a ground elapsed time of 30 hours 3 minutes. Its distance from both the Moon and the Earth at that time will be 114 787 nautical miles. Its velocity, referenced to the Earth, will be 4522 feet per second; referenced to the Moon, 3826 feet per second. The half way mark in time will be reached at a ground elapsed time of 43 hours 8 minutes 6 seconds. At that time Apollo 17 will be 144 924 miles from the Earth, with an Earth reference to velocity of 3551 feet per second. And it will be 87 561 nautical miles from the Moon, with a Moon referenced velocity of 3403 feet per second. Apollo 17 will cross the lunar sphere of influence at the ground elapsed time of 70 hours 43 minutes 24 seconds, at which time it will be 190 725 nautical miles from the Moon. Earth referenced velocity 2 340 feet per second. Distance from the Moon at that time, 33 639 nautical miles, with the lunar referenced velocity of 3356 feet per second At 10 hours 1 minute into the mission, this is Mission Control Ho us t on.

010:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours 29 minutes. Apollo 17 now, 48 070 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 8434 feet per second. Pete Frank and the orange team of flight controllers getting ready to hand over to Jerry Griffin and his gold team of flight controllers at this time. Astronaut Bob Parker will remain as the CAPCOM for a good deal of this next shift. Several spurrious master alarms that were seen while the spacecraft was still in Earth orbit are as yet unexplained. There are no obvious reasons for them. The spacecraft experts in the back rooms, the support rooms here at the Mission Control Center are still tracking this situation. It's not considered a serious problem. The more recent master alarms that have occurred during this shift and during the translunar coast phase after Apollo 17 burned trans-lunar insertion, are attributed to a higher than normal oxygen flow at regular intervals in the cabin. The cabin is still being purged of the partial nitrogen atmosphere that it contained at launch that is being purged, a vent valve is open in the cabin and the higher than normal 02-rate has been introduced to help purge the cabin. Now, added to that when the water accumulator in the suit circuit cycles, there is a brief increase of oxygen flow over and above the higher than normal flow that we are using to purge the cabin. And this is just high enough to when the water accumulators cycles it brings it up just high enough to trigger the master alarm. It is not a problem. The last three or four master alarms that we have seen are attributed to this. However, the Earth orbit master alarms are not yet accounted for. But, they are not considered to be a serious problem. During this shift a midcourse correction number 1 was performed on the SIV-B s t age of the launch vehicle, 13 feet per second performed with the auxilary propulsion system. A second midcourse for that third stage of launch vehicle is planned at a ground elapsed time of 11 hours 15 minutes. The magnitude of the burn is not: yet known. These midcourses are to tune up the trajectory of that stage, to bring it closer to the desired impact point on the lunar surface. As far as the spacecraft is concerned midcourse correction number 1 was passed. we'did not perform midcourse correction number 1. The magnitude at that time was less than 3 feet per second. We will probably perform a midcourse correction number 2 at 35 hours and 30 minutes. A preliminary look at that indicates about a 10-1/2 foot per second burn at that time. The Mission is going well. We have not heard from the crew for some time now and are confident that they are asleep. The spacecraft is in passive thermal-contro1 mode, stabilized in 1 revolution every 18 minutes, approximately 3 per hour. The crew is scheduled to be awakened 4 hours, 24 minutes from this time. At 10 hours 35 minutes into the Mission, this is Mission Control, Houston..

010:36:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours 27 minutes ground elapsed time into the mission of Apollo 17. Approximately 11 minutes ago, as you were 6 minutes ago, the S-IVB corrective burn was performed roughly 14.2 feet per second to modify the trajectory of the S-IVB third stage in the Saturn V, targeting for impact just west of the crater Ptolemaeus at latitude 7 degrees south by longitude 3 degrees west. However, the actual impact location and the time of impact will be forthcoming after some additional hours of tracking of the stage has been gathered. We're looking now at a midcourse correction burn number 2 of the Apollo 17 spacecraft at 35 hours 30 minutes, with a change in velocity -a posigrade of 10.5 feet per sec on d. S one 3-1/2 hours remaining in the crew rest period. All three apparently sound asleep at this time. And the passive thermal control mode puts the spacecraft at spinning at some 3 revolutions per hour. To repeat earlier statistics on half way in distance, time, and when the so-called sphere of influence is crossed will be at the half way point in distance at 30 hours and 3 minutes ground elapsed time, in which time it will be 114 787 nautical miles either direction to the Earth or Moon. And a half way point in time will occur at 43 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds when the spacecraft will be 144 924 nautical miles out from Earth; and 87 561 nautical miles out from the Moon. The so-called sphere crossing, or the point in which the spacecraft is assumed to come under the gravitational influence of the Moon, will take place at 70 hours 43 minutes 24 seconds when the spacecraft is 33 639 nautical miles out from the Moon and approaching. The air/ground circuit has been up all of this time since the crew has retired for a fairly brief rest period, and at this time we will take down the air/ground circuit until the wakeup call is made some 3 hours 29 minutes from now. And at 11 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time., this is Apollo Control.

A short time ago the Booster Systems Engineer Frank Von Ren seler reported that after the final APS burn in the S-IVB stage, which is targeting the stage to impact on the Moon, he reported that the S-IVB stage was tumbling intentionally after that burn, and as he gathered up all his documents and packed his briefcase, on the flight directors loop, he said, "I've enjoyed working with you on the Apollo program." Flight Director Neil Hutchinson replied "It's been nice riding with you." The riding implication being that they were riding on his launch vehicle. Van Renseler is a Marshall Spaceflight Center Engineer detailed to the Flight Control Division here at Manned Spacecraft Center. Van Rensleser finished his job for the last time. He packed his launch vehicle documents and left the room. The booster systems console is vacant for the final time in Apollo. Some 2-1/2 hours remaining in the crew sleep period. No word from the crew. They have not talked to the ground nor vice versa in the last several hours and at 12 hours 29 minutes this is Apollo Control.

013:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 13 hours, 27 minutes ground elapsed time into the Mission of Apollo 17. The spacecraft presently is 61 186 nautical miles out from the Earth, decelerating slightly in its velocity now 72 72 feet per second. Crew had another hour and a half of sleep period remaining. They will be awakened about 2:30 Central Time. This is a rather short sleep period slightly under six hours, the object being to get the crew back on to Houston time day-night cycle eventually. The cycle disturbed somewhat by the, - initially what would have been a night launch, and ended up being a morning launch, - early morning launch at least by Cape time. Got a hand over to the Goldstone 210-foot tracking antenna, about 8 minutes ago. Ar. d ; that station at the present time is handling spacecraft data, and when the crew awakens will handle the voice transmissions between the Control Center and the Crew of Apollo 17. At 13 hours, 28 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 14:00 CST 14:27 GET MC99/1
014:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 14 hours 27 minutes ground elapsed time into the mission of Apollo 17. Slightly more than a half hour remaining until spacecraft communicator, Robert Parker, wakes the crew of Apollo 17 up after a brief 6 hour rest period. Apollo 17 presently 65 thousand 2 hundred 73 nautical miles out from earth; velocity now 6 thousand 9 hundred 74 feet per second. And getting back on schedule with Apollo 17 because of the late liftoff and the hold situation early this morning. The translunar injection burn was targeted to get the spacecraft at the moon or into lunar orbit at about the same actual time it would have had we launched on time - at 8:53 P.M. last night central time. However, to get the flight plan back on the actual indicated ground elapsed times shown in the flight plan at approximately 64 hours they're going to have what is called a GET update some two hours and 40 minutes to force the event times in the flight plan to agree with actual ground elapsed times flown in the mission. We'll come up again in about a half hour as Parker makes his initial wake up call to the crew and at 14 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 14:31 CST 14:57 GET MC100/1
014:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 14 hours 57 minutes ground elapsed time into the mission of Apollo 17. A 2 minutes mark remaining in the crew waken -wake period or sleep period before the crew is awaken. Spacecraft communicator, Bob Parker, should be calling them shortly and we'll stand by for that first wake up call. Rather slack day as far as crew activity today. After their post-sleep check list checking over the systems. The flight director just advised the CAPCOM to hold off on the wake call until they switch antennas. There's some P23 navigation sitings that will be run today and that apparently is about all the activity scheduled during the -this work period. However, there will be at 35 hours and 30 minutes a midcourse correction number 2, which this time looks like about 10 and a half feet per second. Apollo 17 now is 67 thousand 365 nautical miles out from the Earth; velocity 6 thousand 8 hundred 29 feet per second. Spacecraft communicator, Bob Parker, has been joined at the CAPCOM console by backup Apollo 17 commander, John Young, and his relief CAPCOM, Gordon Fullerton. Standing by for the antenna arrangement to be sorted out. Spacecraft, at this time, is still in the barbeque roll or passive thermal control mode, three revolutions per hour to stabilize the temperatures on spacecraft systems. They'll open up the air-ground circuit for the first call when it does come. At 15 hours and 1 minute, this Apollo Control.
|CAPCOM|Here we go. Apollo 17, Houston. Good morn in g.
|SC|Hello, Robert.
|CAPCOM|Glad to have you with us again. You guys got a good nights sleep, we think.
|SC|Well, I'll tell you, It was looked forward to.
|SC|Give us a few minutes here and we'll get operational.
|CAPCOM|Ah, Roger. Give us a call when you are ready to talk to people,,
|SC|Okay .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 14:39 GET 15:06 101/1
015:06:00|SC|From the looks of things, Bob, down there, it looks like getting off last night was a good idea.
|CAPCOM|Got a new Capcom now, Geno. Why does it look kind of cloudy down there?
|SC|Yes, hello Gordo, how you doing? Yes, I'm looking - oh we're probably directly over - just west of the Pacific, but the bottom third of South America I suppose, and I've got North America, Mexico and the U.S. on the top third - top 25 percent of the earth, and it looks like you've got cloud cover from somewhere where the coast bends around Corpus and north into the great lakes and completely out into the Atlantic and it could cover Florida (garbled).
|CAPCOM|Roger. I can verify the part between the Cape and Houston anyway.
|SC|Yes, the Gulf looks like it's pretty well filled with clouds, it looks pretty thick from here.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|However, if you're interested in going to South America, the whole continent looks pretty good, a few clouds, but for the most part you can see the entire continent.
|CAPCOM|Roger. It's summertime down there.
|SC|Hey Gordo, we're stirring slowly. We'll get back with you here,,
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordo, 1 question. How does the spacecraft look to you? I didn't hear anything all night long as far as any master alarms or anything.
|CAPCOM|I'm getting the word that nothing was seen here either. It looks absolutely super.
|SC|Very good.
|SC|Hey Bob, or Gordo, I've got H2 heaters 1 and 2 OFF now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 14:49 CST 15:16 GET MC102/1
015:16:00|SC|Hello, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, America.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, I'm looking over the Flight Plan today. We'll be with you with the postsleep check list, and primarily it looks like a P23 day for Ron. And what we'd primarily like to do is spend a good part of that time getting the spacecraft cleaned up, reshuffled, restowed a little bit and get it in order for the next fews days ahead. It doesn't look like today's that big of ad ay .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Gene, I might give you some words on what we have in mind to get the GET back in sync here, if you want to hear those while you're looking through the upcoming hours.
|SC|Yes, why don't you pass a few words on that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the plan we're considering, and we're offering it to you now for your opinion, is at 65 hours GET we'll update and at the time the clock goes to 65, we'll update it 2 hours and 40 minutes up to 6 7:40. And we're shaping your trajectory such that you'll arrive at the Moon at the same time GMT as you would have had you launched on time. In other words, your translunar time is 2 hours and 40 minutes less. So once we'do that, we'll be back with all the right times in the Flight Plan without any updating. And the one thing we think of is that your next day will, which is now a 16 hour day, will shorten to a 13 hour and 20 minute day. But that's about the only real affect we can see. How does that sound?
|SC|Yes, we - we'll get to the Moon you say the same GMT, so all our sunrise/sunset lunar orbit activity and sun angle at landing will be the same. And let me — it sounds pretty good, Gor; I just want to take a look at that day that you're shortening and see what we're doing in there.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It doesn't cut out anything. In fact, we picked a time that's pretty much dead time as far as the flight plan goes. Take a look, and we'll talk about it later.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Good morning, Gordie, this is Jack.
|CAPCOM|Good morning, Jack.
|SC|Let me fill my square on that post-leak check list. I've got 240 30, PRD?
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And, I slept in and out — probably totaled about 4 hours in that last period. But, I feel pretty good in spite of that and expect now that I've educated myself on how to sleep that it'll pick up the next time around.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|No medication yet, but I'm considering a couple of aspirin. I'll let you know if I take them.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 14:49 CST 15:16 GET MC102/2
015:16:00|SC|And fluid-- let's see, I guess I've had two of your little water-measurement containers full so far, plus the meal I had in my pocket. And, I'll catch up on my — I think I'm a little dehydrated, I'll catch up on fluids with breakfast.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And my meal yesterday was the meal B in the pocket.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Meal B.
|SC|And I guess consumables up to eight, that's mainly yours, there's plenty there, and I'll wait for your words on that, and the watch is wound.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, got the consumables up to eight num bers if you're ready to copy.
|SC|Not quite, Gordie, I'll give you a buzz.
|CAPCOM|Okay. No hurry.
|SC|Okay, the CMP's rads 150 9.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|15019. 15019.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordie, tbis is Jack. How do you want to send the cons umables information?
|CAPCOM|We were just discussing that here in Houston. In flights gone by, there was a place in the flight plan, a little form to fill out, but we're trying to figure out if there is such a place in the current data file. Do you know of one?
|SC|No, I'll tell y ou what I've got on the con sumables curves, and if there are any major changes to those curves, I guess you could give them to me, and I'll put them on as points.
|CAPCOM|There's no place at all.
|SC|Okay, and why don't we just do it that way in the future in case there is anything, and that's on page 145 and subsequent in the flight plan supplement.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|It looks like you took good care of my space - my systems last night.
|CAPCOM|No troubles at all.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 15:26 GET 14:59 CST MC103/1
015:26:00|SC|Okay, Gordy, your friendly medical officer up here has some more information for you. CMP continuing had about 3 hours of sleep, having had 3 cans of fluid - of water that is, and he ate everything in Meal B but the fruit cake and he didn't use the brownies and the beverage in Meal C.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, and continuing the CDR's PRD is 17019. He had 3 hours of fair sleep, no medication, and 1 and 1/2 cans of water, and one/half a sandwich. The CMP's sleep was 3 hours and i'll try to get more systematic as we go along here.
|CAPCOM|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Jack, we are assuming no medication on the CMP. Is that right?
|SC|That's affirmed. We haven't gotten that kit out yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 15:10 GET 15:37 104/1
015:37:00|SC|Gordie, this is Jack. Looks like the windows have cleared up pretty well in PTC from the ice crystals anyway that were on window 1. The hatch window still seems to have a film of something on it, but otherwise they look pretty good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds good. Jack, while you're there you might try - we've been talking about consumable updates and what would be the most meaningful way to give you the information. As a trial for 14 hours with reference to the charts in the back of the book which in the case of - in case a lot of them are listed in percentages except the RCS which is in pounds. On the cryo quantities when I take all the tank percentages and plot them, it turns out that there is no real significant difference from the lines that are plotted on either hydrogen or oxygen. On RCS your running about 3 percent ahead of the line. And if that's a satisfactory way to put it then that's the way we'll give you the updates rather than giving you every tank percent by percent.
|SC|Okay, that's good (garble).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 16:03 GET 15:36 CST MC105/1
016:03:00|SC|Mark 2 aspirins for the LMP.
|CAPCOM|Roger, LMP.
|CAPCOM|Jack, next time the surgeon would like a mark on each individual aspirin.
|SC|Well, I gave it to you since I swallowed them both simultaneously.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|I knew they wanted that, Gordy, and that's why I only gave you one.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Would they rather have them go down one at a time ?
|CAPCOM|I'll have to go back to the back room on th at .
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 16 hours and 25 minutes. The Crew of Apollo 17 is now presently in a meal period. A little bit of levity a short time ago when Jack Schmitt, Lunar Module Pilot, called down to say: "This is LMP, mark, 2 aspirin." He had mentioned earlier in his post-sleep checklist that he was considering taking two aspirins. Apollo 17 is presently 72 843 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 6477 feet per second. We're continuing to stand by on the air-ground circuit for further conversation as the crew finishes up their meal period and gets what few flight plan updates are involved in the days activity. At 16:26 and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 16:27 CST 16:00 MC106/1
016:27:00|CAPCOM|17, Houston. We see the optic starting to stir there, you can go ahead with a P52, but before you do the P23, we have some updates to it.
|SC|Hey, Okay, Gordo, we'll do that.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. Can you confirm that you did change your LioH cannister, before going to sleep last night?
|SC|Well, we can confirm that we'didn't. How about that?
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|We'll, a--, thanks, thanks for reminding us. We'll try that first thing this morning. I was just getting too tired, and the C02 didn't look quite that high last night, so I a-, I let it go.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's a-, that's fine. We're not concerned about being late with it,
|SC|Okay .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 16:21 GET 16:46 107/1
016:46:00|SC|Okay, Houston that looks like a pretty good one that time. You note the star angle difference?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy.
|SC|Okay, I can't see Squat out through that telescope. I just hope it lines it up and does the right thing. Okay, those are the torquing angles and you can let me know when you have them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, standby.
|SC|The telescope is no different than any other time. There is just a lot of reflection from the lunar module and even though everybody said that before you don't quite believe it till you see it yourself.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron you're clear to torque it.
|SC|Okay, we'll torque it 5, 4, 3, 0.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. If we can find a steno grapher I got some dictation, some pads for you and also a flight plan update.
|SC|Standby 1, Gordon.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 16:30 GET 16:56 MC108/1
016:56:00|SC|Okay, Gordie. Oh, okay. Stand by. Okay, Ron's ready to copy.
|SC|P—37 pad's first.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Okay, the P-37 block data for 35 hours. Well, we've got 35, 45, 55, 65. GET ignition of 03500. Delta VT is 5 326 minus 17508139er. For a GET of 04500, 7728 minus 17708118. For a GET of 05500, 5859er minus 17510530. GET of 06500, 4703 minus 175129er40.
|SC|Okay, I'll read that. Let's see, 3500 at 5 326 minus 175 and 8139er at 4500, 7728 minus 177 and 8118. At 5500, it's 5 85 9 e r minus 175, 10530. At 6500, it's 4703 minus 175, and 12940.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's correct. I've got a maneuver pad for you -- it's a fly-by maneuver -- at a time of 81 hours, which is 5 hours prior to LOI. This is required because you're presently on an impacting trajectory, and this is assuming you wouldn't do a midcourse 2. Midcourse 2 will put you on the proper trajectory. If you get a maneuver pad out, I'll give it to you.
|SC|Okay. That's in work.
|SC|Okay, Houston, this is 17, ready for the flyby pad.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We were just watching your roll angle. You're gonna we're going to be updating the optics cal attitude and the roll will be 164, and you're coming up on that. Maybe you want to stop the PTC near that roll angle first.
|SC|Hey, that's a good idea.
|SC|Gordie, did you read Jack?
|CAPCOM|Not clear Jack.
|SC|1 can take the pad if you want to while Ron stops PTC.
|CAPCOM|Okay, why don't I give you the update to the flight plan, since that'll give you the new attitude and also a change in the star for the P23, and then Ron can get on with that. The pad we can get after that.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Turn to 17 hours in the flight plan, page 18.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. The VERB 49 maneuver to optics cal attitude right at the top of the page, cross out the attitude numbers and replace them with roll 164, pitch 301, and yaw 348, at a high gain pitch angle of minus 48 and a yaw of 315. Over.'
|SC|Okay, 164301348 minus 48 and 315.
|CAPCOM|That's correct. Now, go down a few lines to the sighting attitude at 17 hours and 15 minutes, and cross out that attitude and the high gain pitch angle and change to a roll of 196, pitch 304 , and yaw 348. High gain pitch is minus 61, and the yaw remains the same, 357. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 16:30 GET 16:56 MC108/2
016:56:00|SC|Okay, 196304348 minus 61.
|CAPCOM|That's correct. And, now, on the first star P23, we're going to change the star, so cross out -- replace the NOUN 70 numbers with star 21. That would be 3 balls 21. And, delete the NOUN 88 and the vector numbers there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 17:06 CST 16:39 MC109/1
017:06:00|SC|Okay, star 21 and no NOUN 8 8.
|CAPCOM|Right, and over on the fight where it says Merak, you can write in an Alphard, That's what 21 is.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Okay, now, down on the next page, at 18 hours 20 minutes, where it says Optics Calibration Attitude, we got to put in the same thing as the same change as above. We want, instead of 175298330 , change that to 164301 and 348, high gain of minus 48 and 315. Over.
|SC|Okay, 164301348, minus 48 315. Over.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Now, about 10 lines down, delete Charge Battery A. We're going to leave battery A charged for a while longer, since we used up so much of it on the pad last night.
|SC|Okay, delete battery charge A and youwant to leave it on B.
|CAPCOM|Yes. Right. Flip the page. Might as well clean up all of these checklist changes. At 19 hours 40 mintes, change magazine Kilo Kilo to magazine November.
|SC|Okay. That's done.
|CAPCOM|And, then skip a few pages to 24 hours 30 minutes.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|At, just above the CSM systems checklist call out there, write in charge battery A.
|SC|Okay, I got you.
|CAPCOM|And we'll be leaving it on battery A all night long. Okay, that's all the flight plan changes. I've got that fly by pad when you're ready.
|SC|Okay, I'm all set.
|CAPCOM|Okay, purpose is fly by SPS/GNN. The weight is 66839 plus 121 minus 02, correction, the yaw term is a minus 012. Ignition time is 081172103. NOUN 81 is a plus 00911 plus 02041 plus 045 9 3.

|SC|Okay, Gordy, you re ad that?
|CAPCOM|I haven't heard anything since I finished the pad, J ack.
|SC|Okay. I'll push the other button then. Okay, your read back: fly by SPS/GNN 66839 plus 121 minus 012 081172103 plus 00911, plus 02041, plus 04593. 121153321. HA is NA plus

017:15:00|SC|Okay, I got that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, for general information we're planning mid-course 2 tomorrow at about 35 30, and it should be about 10 feet per second.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Strangely enough that's even scheduled at 35 30.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|CAPCOM|One reminder to open the waste stowage vent valve as shown at 17 hours.
|SC|Oh, okay. We were going back to clean up. I think we owe you a LiOH canister change, too.
|CAPCOM|Rog. We concur with changing it.
|SC|Alright, Houston, Apollo 17 will maneuver to the optics calibration attitude now.
|CAPCOM|Okeydoke.
|SC|It's funny, you eat potato soup, and all the soup is all around the outside of the bag and you get a little hole right down through the middle of it.
|CAPCOM|How about that.
|SC|It's just like in 1-G. The spoon isn't quite long enough to reach the bottom without getting your fingers on the side of the bowl.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 16:56 GET 17:21 111/1
017:21:00|SC|Gordie, I don't know what your weather is like down there, but from here it looks like you're probably overcast today. Might even have a pretty good storm blowing.
|CAPCOM|Well, it's gray and cold and a little rain so your call is correct.
|SC|It looks like Mexico in general Is pretty nice; although, there is a band of eastwest trending clouds that start from the Gulf of California cross Senora and probably up through New Mexico and over into Texas as far around as I can see. Southern California looks like it's in pretty good shape today, but Northern California looks like it's probably overcast. And a major system probably associated with that that stretches into the northern western United States. But a band of clear weather looks like it stretches from Arizona right on up through I would guess th ro ugh Colorado, Kansas and probably into the midwest pretty well.
|CAPCOM|Rog, you1 re a regular human weather satellite.
|SC|If Ron would just stop his maneuvers I could tell you some more, but the earth just set behind the LM.
|CAPCOM|Ro g .
|SC|More specifically It set behind the rover, which may be a space first.
|SC|Pretty impressive storm system down off the west coast of Anartica.
|CAPCOM|Roger,
|SC|And Houston the canister has been changed. Number 3 is in A as per the earlier flight plan instructions.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Sorry we were late, but we got a little tired last night.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 17:02 GET 17:28 MC112/1
017:28:00|CAPCOM|Uh, Jack, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead and get that waste storage bin open now so we can keep to the schedule on cabin enrichment.
|SC|Okay, Ron is getting that. Keep nagging.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SC|That the same as I had before?
|SC|Hey, that looks like a pretty good optics count right there. That's three times.
|SC|Okay. No, that's not (garble).
|CAPCOM|Ron, we're copying your comments.
|SC|Okay. Think we'll use that one there for the optics count.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 17:45 GET 17:20 CST MC114/1
017:45:00|SC|Those were associated with the accumulator as I recall.
|SC|Yeah, the random one's are the ones I was interested in. They just seem to stop. Of course we haven't been moving switches on 2, but we were getting them without doing that also.
|SC|Okay, there's the old star. Works just like the simulator, you can't see the star when it goes down in th e E arth.
|CAPCOM|It's still being worked on, Jack, though we'don't have any real concrete story to give you on it yet.
|SC|Okay, it seemed to be pretty quiet last night, so that's the only problem. Okay, Gene, you want to give me CMC 3.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Ah, let's see. 375 okay, that's not too bad. (garbled)
|SC|(Coughing.)
|SC|Yeah, I don't know what's ---
|SC|Okay, those (garbled) punch a hole in it.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 17 hours 54 min utes. The change of shift press conference is ready to begin at this time in the MSC News Center Briefing Room. We'll take down the live air-to-ground, record, and play back immediately following the press conference.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 18:02 GET 18:28 115/1
018:28:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 18 hours 29 minutes. During the change of shift press briefing, flight director Gene Kranz reviewed the status of the mission with each of his flight controllers everything essentially normal at this point. Flight dynamics officer reported that they have not yet gotten sufficient tracking on the S-IVB trajectory to give an impact point based on tracking. We should have that in a matter of hours. And we'll get a report as soon as a set of coordinates for the S-IVB impact are available. Also, capcom Gordon Fullerton read up a news report to the crew. And it's been relatively quiet for the past 5 or 10 minutes on the air to ground line. We'll replay the accumulated tape and as soon as we've caught up with the tape we'll stand by for live conservations with the crew.
|SC|That's five on that star. Could you concur that's five on that star, Houston?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, let me check.
|SC|I think it was. I'll take another one j us t in cas e.
|SC|Okay, Gene CMC auto.
|SC|All right 20 okay that's far horizon. P 1 us 02745 plus 99128 28 enter plus 12885 12885 12885 okay. Okay, want the 180 option no, computer check me 2 Betelgeuse. Okay, this is earth far horizon. Bunch of old ones, yes, I got it, okay, since we're there - okay this is the old star of (garble). Okay, it's the far horizon double line is down in the earth GDF, reach up a little bit here. Okay, didn't do such a hot job of putting them on there. Do you want to go to CMC free? Okay, give it a flip that way and a flip that way and a yaw that way two yaws that way. (singing) holy mackeral. That was a good ma rk .
|SC|Gordie, this is the LMP.
|SC|Hello Houston, 17, how do you read?
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|You got any news today to read up to us?
|CAPCOM|Yes, as a matter of fact we have a little bit made up here. I guess more on the personal line. We checked with Barbara and Jan and the kids and they're all back home safe and sound and they mentioned that they're going into they're going into their own personal quarantine period they are glued to the squawk box. Over.
|SC|I was afraid you were going to get to personal there for a minute.
|CAPCOM|I'll run down a few quick summaries of this mornings news. Former president Harry Truman has rallyed slightly despite his weakened heart and labored
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 18:02 GET 18:28 115/2
018:28:00|CAPCOM|breathing. His doctors report that their main worry is whether or not he is strong enough to withstand the strain the physical strain of 88 years despite the slight rally Truman's condition is still considered critical. In Paris Henry Kessinger met with Hanoi's Le Due Tho for four hours yesterday in planned secret talk. Paris newspapers report that eminant cease fire, but neither Kessinger or Tho indicate that this is true. After the four hour talks Kessinger shook hands and his aid, but neither representative made any comment concerning their meeting. At Camp David Maryland President Nixon's press secretary Ronald Ziegler said that Kessinger and Nixon are in close communication by cable concerning the secret peace talks. Ziegler declined to provide more information about the progress in the talks. President Nixon selected Claude S. Brenniger a California oil executive and a doctor of economics to be secretary of transportation succeeding John A. Volpe. Volpe will become U.S. ambassador to Italy. Here's one concerning last nights launch. Mrs. Spiro Agnew reportedly made a wish on a falling star just before the delayed launch of Apollo 17. Sitting beside there at the VIP viewing site was Barbara Cernan who said that she was nervous when the liftoff was postponed. She added that A1 Bean was there with me he said not to be concerned. Mrs. Cernan was accompained by her daughter Tracy and her mother Mrs. Jackie Ashly, Mrs. Ron Evans who saw the launch with her children Jamie and John said that she was never worried because everybody knew what they were doing.
|SC|Laughter. Good summary Gordo we thank you and our best wishes for the return health of Mr. Truman.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordo, we were figuring up here that we probably launched on the 6th of December in Houston and on the 7th of December in Florida.
|CAPCOM|That's right you call it right.
|SC|Okay, CMC auto there Gene, please. Oh boy. Okay, let's use the verb 23 enter, ah, what did I do there. Enter, let's see is 110. There okay. Verb 25 enter okay my prime Veotus. (Coughing). Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 18:28 CST 18:11 MC116/1
018:28:00|SC|Okay, minus, 8490, 84900, next. Plus 40299, plus 40299, entered. Plus 34176. Entered. Okay, proceed. 202 18 and okay. There already. (garbled) Try one more time. In CMC AUTO, 196306 , Gordy, you still there? That's right.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack.
|SC|I mentioned to Bob yesterday how when we moved away from the Earth how fragile a piece of blue it looked to be and that impression certainly grows the further you get from it. I wish everj^body could have a chance to get that impression. Things might go a little easier for us.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Gene, you are in CMC (garbled)
|SC|(singing) You must be making the vector worse and worse instead of better. (laughing) Well, (garbled) the star points, half way through the Earth almost. Not really.
|SC|Gordy, we haven't really had a clear and detailed description of what you or somebody else saw at the launch, in terms of the lightning around the countryside, the state of the flame and how long the exhaust was under the S-1C. Do you have anything to add to that?
|CAPCOM|I can tell you my feelings anyway. There was a spectacular sight. There's no doubt about it. I'd say the level of illumination would have made it easy to read a newspaper or anything like that from my vantage point near the VAB. The plume itself was, actually looked no larger or even any brighter, really, except in contrast than it does on a daylight by comparison. But, oh, the effect I guess is about what I expected. Just trying to extrapolate previous launches into a night time situation. The weather was very clear. That was one advantage gained by delaying the launch the 2 hours and 40 minutes that we'did. By that time there were very few clouds around at all. And we could see a brilliant light there when the first stage cut off and the second stage ignited. And I lost you visually probably, oh, 4 to 5 minutes into the second stage as best I can remember. Part of the problem was the brightness of the plume during the first stage. It kind of burned a spot in my eyes, and so then I was - had reduced efficiency at looking for a small point of light from there on out, Stu's here with me and he was watching it to. I'll see if he has anything to add.
|SC|litu, who?
|CAPCOM|He said after that comment he has no comment.
|SC|(Laughter) I'm sorry, Stu. I can't believe that, Stu always has something to add. (singing) Alright, you said in case you just noticed I forgot the first 67 until just now. Although, in reality all we're trying to do here is get a DELTA H measurement anyhow. And you got any feel yet for what the DELTA H line has (garbled) been?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 18:28 GET 18:11 CST MC116/2
018:28:00|CAPCOM|Standby, Ron,
|CAPCOM|Ron, this is Houston. We're not going to be able to give you a handle on the Delta H until we have a chance to take all the data and reduce it and work it around a little.
|SC|Okay, that's mighty fine.
|SC|Okay, (garbled) Okay, here's the far horizon. 2, 3, enter, 1, 2  3, 25 here. (singing) Have an 0, 7, 3, enter plus F064. Enter there. Okay. That is the unit vector of the star. Okay, it's the 180 option we'don't want. Get me the real option. I guess - Houston, you must be getting all the good data without the high gain, huh?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Ron.
|SC|Okay. Okay. Let's enter that. Okay, Gene, go CMC 3 now. Okay, go CMC 3 now. Yeah, that's about a half a sextant in diameter above the horizon. The star point looks pretty good though. A (garbled). Not yet. Yeah, it's on---There A CMC auto. Now, last star What was that? Going to go back to the calibration attitude. Okay. CMC auto in caged and away we go. Used up the waste water too - 2 percent. 164 301 and 318, that's a optics calibration attitude. We want to start with linemark line of sight mark on star 22. Put the (garbled) Also the optics line of sight. See the optics (garbled)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 18:21 GET 18:46 MC117/1
018:46:00|SC|Okay, Houston, looks like optics calibration is 89 995, I get that half the time and 997 the rest. So we'll use 995 I guess.
|CAPCOM|I - -
|SC|Okay, Houston, you ready for some purges and dumps ?
|CAPCOM|Let me make sure here. Standby.
|SC|Well, I had my clock on the wrong scale. Is that about 2 minutes, Houston?
|CAPCOM|That's good, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Did you copy that, Jack? They said that was f ine.
|SC|Yes sir, Stu, I copied that. How are you?
|CAPCOM|Okay, swinging.
|SC|That's good to hear.
|CAPCOM|Sure am enjoying your descriptions.
|SC|Well, if I could get Ron off his work with the optics, I'd look at the Earth some more. But that will come. Right now I'm seeing all sorts of little ice crystals of various composition, that are moving around and everyone of them bounces off the LM that I can see. No, none of them stick. I noticed that some of them will go into a corner with a fairly high velocity and either be turned around by a double bounce, or just get lodged in the corner and have very low velocity when they come out.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Most of them look like they have at least a foot or two per second.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Hey Jack, I'm surprised when you said when you got Ron off the optics. Don't tell me that Ron is going to let you look through his optics.
|SC|Oh heavens no, we just move the window.
|CAPCOM|Okay .
|SC|That's for sure.
|PAO|The CAPCOM at the present time is Astronaut Stuart Roosa, backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 17.
|SC|Stu, apparently you do get some particle - particle collisions, because some of the trajectories are back t owa r ds us .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll wait for the explanation of th at.
|SC|Well, I think it's because the particles, some of them are bouncing off the LM and get out into the stream which normally would have no collision. How's that?
|SC|5fou can say it's not very good. I don't care .
|CAPCOM|Got to use tact here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 18:53 CST 18:27 MC118/1
018:53:00|CAPCOM|We have animated description of the behav iour of a cloud of ice crystals drifting along with spacecraft is coming from Jack Schmitt. Apollo 17 at this point is 81 654 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 5972 feet per second. And we see from the telemetry data that the fuel cell purge called for in the flight plan at this time is progressing. This involves flowing, in this case, oxygen at a high rate through the fuel cell for a short period of time to remove any build-up of contaminants. And, as a routine maintenance or housekeeping procedure, same thing is also done periodically for the hydrogen.
|CAPCOM|You can terminate the purge on fuel cell 3-02.
|SC|Yes. I even forgot to listen for the bing on that one. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|17, we'll be having a communications hand over to Honeysuckle in about a minute and a half.
|SC|Okay, Gordo. That's great. Next time I look at the Earth, I'll see what's happening in Australia.
|SC|Okay, Houston. We're starting our waste water now. Wish us luck. Wish us luck. Yes, that really goes out.
|CAPCOM|Can you give us POO and ACCEPT and we'll give you a new state vector'?
|SC|Probably need one after all those marks. Okay, you've got POO and ACCEPT.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 18:37 GET 19:03 119/1
019:03:00|CAPCOM|Okay, the vector's in there, it's your c omp uter,
|SC|Okay, Gordo, thank you. This is Apollo control at 19 hours 7 minutes. The crew aboard Apollo 17 has completed the next item in the flight plan in the way of housekeeping duties aboard the spacecraft. That involved dumping waste water. Water is accumulated in a 7 to 8 gallon tank on the spacecraft which is produced as a by product of generating electricity in the fuel cells. These fuel cells generate quite a bit more water than the spacecraft is able to consume for cooling and for crew drinking purposes. The excess goes into a waste water tank and periodically it's dumped down to about lO^percent, and the crew has just completed that activity. We re going to take advantage of a relatively quiet time in the flight plan at this time to replay a portion of the air-to-ground conservations with the spacecraft which included among other things a rather detailed description of earth given by Jack Schmitt, some weather patterns. This replay is necessitated by a problem that we had with a portion of the public affairs release circuit between 4:40 and 5:05 p.m. central standard time this afternoon in which a portion of the release circuit did not receive the air-to-ground and for the benefit of those people who missed that portion of air-to-ground we'll replay the tapes at this time.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 19:06 GET 19:32 MC120/1
019:32:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 19 hours 33 minutes. That completes our replay of the segments of the air-to-ground that were lost on a portion of the Public Affairs Release Network earlier today. During that replay, we accumulated about 5 or 6 minutes of additional tapes with the crew, how the activities involved during that period of time or completion of waste water dump, the crew dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and stored in a storage tank on the spacecraft, and they dump it down to about 10 percent of its quantity, or its capacity. And, also completed one other routine housekeeping activity. That was cycling the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras contained back in the service module scientific instrument module bay. That bay, of course, still has the door over it. The door will be jettisoned before going into orbit around the moon exposing those cameras for use in lunar orbit taking high-re solution and very accurately controlled mapping cameras -- or mapping photos of the lunar surface. The cycling of the film is made necessary by the fact that the film is under some tension in the magazine in the transport mechanism. This tension tends to put pressure on the emulsion, and if the film is not advanced, oh, four or five cycles, at least once every 24 hours, it tends to create striations in the emulsion, and this is done during the translunar coast when the cameras are not being used periodically, once a day to prevent these striations from developing in the emulsion of the film. We'll replay that accumulated tape for you and then continue to stand by live.
|SC|(garble) Are you going to want to cycle s ome film he re?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed. We're planning on it. Try and make sure they're ready, though, before you do it.
|SC|Well, I didn't want to bring it up, but you're about 20 minutes late on your cue.
|CAPCOM|You must have missed our first call.
|SC|I probably did.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we're ready for the pan and mapping camera film cycling. You haven't started into the procedure yet, is that correct?
|SC|No,not yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at your convenience, we're ready to watch you do it.
|SC|Okay. And, with those last high-gain - I guess they're still good, huh? You want the high-gain on it?
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like you to use pitch at minus 50 and yaw at 320 and acquire the high gain.
|SC|Okay , wi 11 do .
|CAPCOM|You have 10 percent waste water now. You can terminate the dump.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 19:06 GET 19:32 MC120/2
019:32:00|SC|Okay. We're just about there.
|SC|Okay, (garble) motion is off.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The systems are going on. AUX TV Is going s ci en t i f i c .
|CAPCOM| Jack, we'd like auto and NARROW on the h i gh-gain.
|SC|There you go. Okay?
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SC|Okay. SMAC power is coming on. Mapping camera is going standby, (garble). And, mode is verified in standby.
|SC|Pan camera mode's, yes. Okay. Pan camera has gone to power. Now, barber pole (garble). Okay, the pan camera just went to power. Okay, Ron's talking to you. Didn't know that.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Pan camera's self test has gone to h ea te rs .
|SC|High-bit rate. Okay, waiting your cue Gordi e.
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by. Okay, Ron, we're ready for the film cycling.
|SC|Okay, mapping camera is going on. Okay, pan camera's self test is going to self test like next barber— pole. Okay, I forgot to time it, yeah. Okay, talk back when ready on the pan camera.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, pan camera's power is off. Okay, mapping camera is going off. Okay, SMAC power is coming off, h uh ?
|SC|Okay, Houston. Film cycling is complete.
|CAPCOM|Okay . It looks real good on both cameras.
|SC|Ve ry good.
|SC|Okay, Gordie. If your friends there on your left are wondering what strange sounds they're hearing, I just got the harness on.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And, then, I guess if you're through with the high-gain, I'll go back to Omni BRAVO.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We concur with that idea.
|SC|And, if I could ever get Ron out of the kitchen, we'd get it into PTC.
|CAPCOM|Jack, you'll be glad to know your heart is beating normally. We have a good signal.
|SC|Just so long as it's beating, Gordie. About 20 hours ago, I wasn't so sure. now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 19:06 GET 19:32 MC120/3 Gordo, we're maneuvering to the PTC attitude
019:32:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Houston, Apollo 17. Any recommended quads for damping the PC RCS ?
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that, Ron. We'll give it to you in a minute.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we're recommending AB for damping and BRAVO Delta for roll spin up. I'll say again. Alpha Bravo for damping and Bravo Delta for roll spin up.
|SC|Okay, Robert, and welcome back aboard.
|CAPCOM|Roger, sir.
|SC|You know, this eating in zero G's is not so bad if you keep your bags right side up. If you keep them that way, you get the right prospective. It's sure something funny if you turn the bag upside down, and it still doesn't fall out.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Having a little peach ambrosia for a s n a ck here.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. That - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 19:15 GET 19:41 121/1
019:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo control. That completes our replay of accumulated tape we'll now stand by for any live conservations with the crew. One thing additionally that we get out of cycling the cameras the panoramic and mapping cameras as an indication of how they are performing mechanically. As you heard based on the telemetry data that we got here on the ground both cameras appear to be functioning properly tucked away in the scientific instrument module bay of the CSM. You also heard some conservation with Jack Schmitt who is wearing the biomedical harness during sleep periods it's customary for one of the three crewman only to wear the biomedical harness which allows them to get heart rate during the sleep period and the crewman take turns wearing that biomedical harness and during the sleep we are getting good biomedical data good heart rate data on Schmitt at the present time. Also, Ron Evans commented on getting the spacecraft in the PTC attitude. Essentially, this attitude has the spacecraft oriented at right angles to it's direction of travel. Right angles to the Earth Moon plane so that the Sun is essentially shining on the sides of the vehicle of the CSM and LM. And, then using the reaction control system thrusters on the conand module they set up a slow roll rate so that the two vehicles docked together are rotating at the rate of about three revolutions per hour. And, if this is done properly and it's a tricky maneuver usually crews get more and more experienced at it as they go through the mission, and tend to have the most problems early on in getting it set up. But if it is set up with all of the rates damped and everything very stable when the roll is started it will maintain this roll without wobbling out of it throughout the rest period. The purpose of this is to maintain a proper thermal equilibrium on the spacecraft so that the heating on one side from the Sun the cooling of the other as it is exposed to the black of space is uniform and nothing gets too hot or too cold. At the present time Apollo 17 is 84 482 nautical miles from earth and the velocity continuing to decrease gradually down to about 5 824 feet per second just a little over one mile per second. We'll continue to stand by live now for any conversations with the crew. This could continue to be a relatively quiet period based on Ron Evans or I guess it was Jack Schmitt's comment that Evans was in the kitchen leads us to believe that they are probably getting ready to eat. This is Apollo control at 19 hours 45 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 19:50 CST 19:25 MC122/1
019:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 19 hours 51 minutes. On the telemetry data that we have here in the Control Center, we're watching as the spacecraft is automatically killing off its rates, in preparation for setting up it's passive thermal control mode. They're getting the vehicles very stable, and they're measuring rate changes in thousandths of a degree per second. And when it is as essentially as stable as it appears possible to get it, they'll then fire the thrusters, to begin rolling at a slow 3 revolutions per hour rate. This is the second passive thermal control mode established.
|CAPCOM|The rates are looking good, they're amped adequately. We're ready for spin-up.
|SC|Okay, Bob.
|PAO|The crew set up the spacecraft in the passive thermal control mode before their previous sleep period and experienced no difficulty, and they appear to be going very smoothly. In this passive thermal control setup you heard CAPCOM Robert Overmeyer who's come in to relieave CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton, advise them that the rates have been killed off sufficiently to begin rotating the veh i c les now.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, we're in PTC. Or Bob, I guess you're down there now,
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Bob, did you ever find out what part of Antartica we were seeing at various Earth orientations?
|CAPCOM|Jack, I've tried this afternoon and I couldn't get hold of anybody and I looked on map for awhile and I'm not sure where little America was, I can't truthfully say I did it. I'll keep looking at it.
|SC|Okay, at any rate, it looks like there's a very well developed front coming out of the northwestern portion of Antartic ice shelf. And the front, and let's see here. Stand by 1. Have to change windows.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Bob, that front, looks like it starts and develops as a small, it actually seems to start with an anti cycle in development off the coast of Antartica. Moves up across New Zealand. Looks like the south island primarily, a little bit of the north island is still visible. And into the eastern coast of Australia, I'll give you a spot where it intersects and crosses the whole of Australia. However, it breaks up and is not very well formed, once it gets inland away from the coast. I see no well developed waves on it at this time, so it's hard to say how strong it is. There might be one developing just to the south of New Zealand, or right off the coast of New Zealand.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I copy that, Jack.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 19:50 CST 19:25 MC122/2
019:50:00|SC|There at: least some sinusoidal motion or appearance to the front, and you'll have to wait because I lost it again.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I took two 50 millimeter pictures, mag November, November is on 132.
|CAPCOM|Roger, November, November on 132. Those are pictures of the ...
|SC|And that was that - -
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston. Were those pictures of those fronts you were talking about?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 19:35 GET 20:00 123/1
020:00:00|PAO|That was Jack Schmitt giving us the description of the weather patterns developing off the northwest coast of antartica and extending up towards New Zealand and Australia. Apollo 17 at the present time is about 85 500 nautical miles from Earth and situated over the south Pacific. The spacecraft now essentially fixed with the respect to the Earth and Moon, but the earth rotating beneath it as the earth rotates - -
|SC|Orbital map out now and that front is going off across the coast of Australia north of Sidney and largely a little south of Brisbain. And swings across the whole of Australia and seems to come as near as I can tell go by into the Indian Ocean about well where the great Sandy desert intersects the northwestern coast of Australia.
|CAPCOM|Thanks Jack.
|CAPCOM|17, I've got a flight plan update here.
|SC|Stand by, please.
|CAPCOM|Rog, it's just a short one, one item to change.
|SC|Well, if you saw my hands right now you'd know why I said wait one.
|CAPCOM|Understand I'm just waiting for your call didn't want you to think we're going to give you a whole (garble) rap of it.
|SC|Oh, we know you wouldn't do that.
|CAPCOM|If your eating Jack just go ahead and eat this is nothing that can - we can just wait and anytime j us t go ahead .
|SC|Yeah, I'm not pan icing.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 19:41 GET 20:08 124/1
020:08:00|SC|Okay, Bob go on the update and LM CM Delta-P at 20 (gable).
|CAPCOM|What do you know Jack we just got cut out by the antenna switching. Say again the LM CM Delta-P.
|SC|Okay, 0.6 at 20 plus 09.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Okay, my update is just simply on the bottom of page 3-23 at 23 hundred hours in the flight plan or 23 hours in the flight plan. Waste stowage vent valve closed just delete that one and move it over to 2430 that's because you got started late on that.
|SC|Ckay, you could have just said move it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just change it down to 2430.
|SC|2430.
|SC|Okay, Bob revision 1 on my previous scratching of the letter on Australia that front does cross probably Brisban is probably cloudy it does cross about that area and however there is a bank of clouds that runs off of it down the coast line so Sidney is either cloudy or has some pretty nice clouds off shore. And the remnants of the front as it dissipates in the Hinterland of Australia dies out at about the Great Sandy Desert and there is not a good indication that it crosses into the Indian Ocean. But, we're getting over near the LM and that's a little hard to tell.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Now, it looks more and more like there is a cyclone circulation developing right over the top of New Zealand the south island I think. And now I'm looking with the Binoc and as much at anti cyclone circulation is centered on the ice shelf and I think that well I just don't know I think that s the Ross ice shelf I'm not sure off An t a r t i c and the clouds from that circulation do extend over the ice shelf and barely onto the Antartic continent.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Now to the north of Antartica. let's see now I ought to give you a better orientation than that. Anyway, there is a large cyclone circulation pattern that has it's southern extremity right on the edge of the ice shelf. And that is east by 20 or 30 degrees longitude on the front that I was just discussing. The way that front intersects An t ar ti ca.
|CAPCOM|Roger Jack.
|SC|Between New Zealand and Australia the front I was discussing previously has some fairly strong transverse cloud patterns it's hard to say whether they are high cirrus or not, but the clear area to the south of the front suggests that maybe the jet stream is roughly parrelling

020:08:00|SC|that front in that area.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I'd have to look up and see if they do have any jet streams there right now.
|SC|If I had to guess if you were flying west from Sidney this afternoon you'd have a pretty strong tailwind behind you, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Did I get that right.
|SC|Would you believe a headwind?
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll believe that.
|SC|But, the bulk of Australia is very clear all the south and the north. It's just that one line of clouds that crosses the center section.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 20:17 CST 19:51 MC125/1
020:17:00|SC|That put all the major cities of the South, Perth, Adelaide, at least, and Melbourne certainly in the clear. And in the North Darwin, in those areas, are very nicely clear today.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I hope we can get this out to them and let them know you're watching and tell them how good the weather is.
|SC|Oh, that's alright. I'm just having fun, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Understand. I imagine they'd appreciate it, t h o ugh. SC Bob, I tried to pick out the Hawaiian Islands on that last little turn here through window 5. And I can't say that I did. I think I've got 'em - the area spotted. It looks like they might be under some fairly heavy cloud cover today. I do not see the islands. I'm not sure I could i f---

020:01:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, Jack, I got some answer to your question last night on where Little America is with respect to on Ant arti ca.
|SC|Go ahead .
|CAPCOM|There's an indentation that looks like a gulf, that's called the Ross Sea, and on the northwest edge of the Ross Sea, is Little America. That's the location of it.
|SC|Okay, and that would be the coast of Antartica that sort of faces New Zealand and Australia. Is that corre ct ?
|CAPCOM|Negative. According to the map I've got. The Ross Sea looks like it would be more facing up towards South America area. It's actually kinda facing up sort of the middle between Australia and South America, Jack.
|SC|Okay, Bob, you cut out, and I presume you meant the Ross Sea was facing north toward the Pacific between South America and Australia.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack. SC It's a very sharp indentation or sea or gulf onto the Antartic---
|SC|Okay, I think I know the area you mean and I' 11 check it out again when it comes by.
|CAPCOM|Okay. That's Little America on that west northwest edge of that Ross Sea. That's where Little Ame ri ca is.
|SC|Yeah, all that - those names are familiar. I just have forgotten my geography. I'll see if I can recognize them.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 20:40 CST 20:13 MC127/1
020:40:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 20 hours 45 minutes. We're occasionally picking up a bit of noise on the Air-to-Ground circuit. This is due to the fact that the spacecraft is in the passive thermal control mode, as it rotates. We're gradually losing contact through one of the OMNI antennas and re-establishing adequate signal strength on another one. And as it moves from antenna to antenna on our coverage, we get the noise. This is a characteristic that becomes more pronounced as the spacecraft gets farther and farther from Earth. Here in Mission Control, the Flight Activities Officer has been actively involved in figuring out how in the flight plan we're going to make up for the 2 hours 40 minutes difference from the flight plan liftoff time and the actual liftoff time. One of two things happen when you lift off late for a mission. Either the events that are called out in the flight plan occur at a different Earth time, Central Standard, Eastern Standard, or Greenwich Mean whichever reference you happen to be using, or the elapsed times change. And the flight planning is all done in terms of elapsed time for the most part. Events that are called out in the flight plan are listed by the amount of time that has elapsed from liftoff. At the present time, in the Apollo 17 flight plan, the amount of time that has elapsed since liftoff is unchanged from the pre-mission flight plan time. However, as, by the time we have approached or reached the Moon, because of the speeded up translunar coast time, occasioned by slightly faster or slightly greater amount of energy that was put in during the translunar injection burn, we'll have to make up 2 hours 40 minutes. In other words, we'll be arriving at the Moon 2 hours 40 minutes earlier than flight plan allowed for. This means that all of the events that are called in the flight plan to occur between now and lunar arrival have to be accomplished in 2 hours 40 minutes less time than the flight plan allows for. This creates no serious problems, because it's a relatively quiet period of the mission. It's very easy, by adjusting sleep period slightly and moving the activities up to accomplish it. However, the flight planning officer, flight activities officer, prefers to accomplish this shift in two increments rather than a single one. And this could be likened to a change of daylight savings time, where you don't want to make the jump too big at once, and you might start interfering in a way that would be noticeable, say, with sleep periods. But by accomplishing it in two segments, the change is relatively insignificant. And what this amounts to Is that at two different times in the flight plan, we'll read changes to the crew, and they will go down the flight plan, moving a
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 20:40 CST 20:13 MC127/2
020:40:00|PAO|series of events approximately 1 hour earlier. The second time that this is done, they'll actually be moving events 1 hour 40 minutes earlier and at the same time, we'll update the clocks in Mission Control, the Ground Elapsed Time clocks, which serve as the key to where you are in the flight plan to agree with the changes we have made in the flight plan. And from that point on, the GET clock will be back in synchronization with the flight plan. This clock update is presently scheduled to occur at 66 hours Ground Elapsed Time, rather at 67 hours 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and we'll move the clocks to 66 hours. Apollo 17 at present time is 88 091 nautical miles from EARTH.
|SC|Checking on the Ross Sea, and if I've got her pegged right, it's got a fair amount of open water in it this time of year.
|CAPCOM|Roger,
|SC|Although, it's completely surrounded,I think, completely surrounded, I think by portions of the ice pack. And off to the west of there, it looks like there's an area that might be clear of snow, and if my memory serves me correctly, that's where MacMertle Sound is, and some of the dry valleys?
|CAPCOM|I believe so. That's the Little America area right now, all that general vicinity, Jack.
|SC|Okay, it looks liks the prime recovery area. The Samoa Island region is clear and my guess would be from the fairly subdued zero phase point, that they might have fairly nice seas out there. The boys on the Ticonderoga are probably enjoying themselves immensely, I hope.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:26 GET 20:50 128/1
020:50:00|SC|Indonesia looks like it's having a nice day, with the possible exception of the region over just north of Australia. New Guinea and that area some clouds in there I can't tell whether they are high or low clouds though they look like they're probably fairly high clouds. But north of New Guinea there is a strong concentration of clouds although small and looks fairly dense like there might be a little tropical depression in that area.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The folks in Carnarvon ought to be enjoying a very nice day. I've been trying to spot tropical storm Teresa which a couple of days ago was in the Phillipines. I don't think I quite have that visible to me right now.
|CAPCOM|Roger Jack. Say, you might want to put something in the back of your mind here a minute we made a run of the DSE recording just now of the TLI to get an idea of the quality of the DS E recording and Gene came through loud and clear. Ron was very weak and almost unreadable and we never caught you Jack. Maybe you weren't saying anything during TLI, but we never did catch anything you said.
|SC|Okay, I don't recall talking to much during TLI.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand. Now Gene came through real loud and clear so whatever technique he was using went on that tape real well.
|CAPCOM|Hey Jack, Houston.
|SC|Hello.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Jack just a couple more comments on that DSE. I think as you well know it's very critical on the position of your boom there and those areas that you are critical in make sure that you've really got those beauties up or your talking right in to it and this really makes a difference because the DSE - the volume is fairly low, and if you're muddled just the least bit why it's going to be difficult to pick it up. So talk slow and get right up next to the mike as I know your doing, it just that some voices come across a little better than others.
|SC|Roger Stu, thanks for the comments as a matter of fact you probably called it just right I think during - once I got the helmet off I loosen up my chin strap and my mike had moved away from my mouth some. And I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the reminder.
|CAPCOM|Yes, that's probably the most cri t i cal item is that - is the position of those and this has been true in the past and it just really makes a difference in being able to pick up the data off the voice.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:26 GET 20:50 128/2
020:50:00|SC|Roger I've — Ron and I did some experi mentation with that in the chamber and couldn't agree more. But, I sometimes don't remember it. Thank you. Okay, go ah e ad , S t u .
|CAPCOM|I'm sure your aware of that, but I think the fact that the volume is down just accentuates the problem.
|SC|Okay, Gene had something he wanted to as k you.
|SC|Stu, I just thought you would like to be aware of it as much time as we've all spent down at the Cape probably May is one of the nicest months down there however, having had the opportunity to be up here during May I find out that it's not nearly as nice up here
|CAPCOM|Okay1'
|SC|And, I d like to thank all my friends for that.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 21 hours 3 minutes. Things continuing to progress smoothly and very quietly here in mission control and aboard the spacecraft. And we'd like to have a bit more discussion of the ground elapsed time update after first making the disclaimer that GET clock updates are not done for the purpose of confusing people; although, I'm sure it seems that way at times. And, by way of clarifying the previous description of this GET update we should point out that the amount of time that the clocks are changed both here and mission control and aboard the spacecraft will be 2 hours and 40 minutes and this clock change is scheduled to occur as mentioned previously at about 65 hours ground elapsed time. In other words when the clocks here in the control center and the clocks in the spacecraft keeping track of the time that has elapsed since liftoff reach 65 hours they will be arbitrarily jumped ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes so that at that point the clocks agree with the flight plan. However, in order to account for these 2 hours and 40 minutes which are suddenly going to disappear from the amount of time available to the crew to accomplish their activities to make it easier on the crew it will be done in two increments. The first increment of 1 hour and the second increment of 1 hour 40 minutes. And, at about the time the second increment of change is made in the flight plan we'll also simultaneously update the clocks. Apollo 17 at this time 88 909 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to decrease gradually down now to 5 603 feet per second. Very little activity is scheduled in the flight plan between now and the time the crew begins
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:26 GET 20:50 128/3
020:50:00|PAO|It's rest period. This day aboard the spacecraft has been planned as a relatively short one recognizing that the crew would not get a great deal of sleep on that very long - as a result of the very long launch day. And a relatively short sleep period following. This day was intentionally kept short. They're now - should be completing their eat period although they really have nothing showing in the flight plan until about 22 hours or about another hour from now where they have alloted time for an exercise. They will be changing the lithium hydroxide canisters that remove carbon dioxide from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. They will be realigning the spacecraft platform the stable platform that's used as an attitude reference by the guidance navigation and control system. Then they have one more eat period and go through the p re sleep check list beginning an 8 hour rest period at about 25 hours ground elapsed time or a little less than 4 hours from now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:40 GET 21:07 MC129/1
021:07:00|SC|Bob, you with me?
|CAPCOM|Roger. We wouldn't go away, Jack. We're listening. Did you call?
|SC|Well, I just — yeah, I almost lost a pass here and just a couple more words about Australia. As a general land mass, it's red. Very strong red hues, except for the north and eastern coasts, where that red gradually merges into a greenish-gray. It's as red as portions of northern Africa appeared to me yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Very striking color. It would be more of an orange-red, really, with brown subduing it. It's obviously not crimson or anything.
|CAPCOM|You think it's a function of sun angle, Jack, or is it just a red like we see out in the New Mexico area sometimes — some of the areas?
|SC|Yeah. No, it's not sun angle, because that'll hold a good red color right in towards sunset or sunrise. It's due primarily, I'm sure, like most desert areas, to the oxidation of the iron-bearing minerals in the sands and rocks in those regions.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Getting limanite and hematite. Little geology thrown in there, Bob. Sorry.
|CAPCOM|That's all right. Gotta keep you warmed up for the next couple of days.
|SC|I think the flight plan will probably keep me warmed up, too.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We thought that time around T & D was just outstanding.
|SC|Hey, Bob, I think we pretty well got impressions from you down there on that night launch. I might give you a few of mine.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Gene.
|SC|(garble) right there.
|CAPCOM|You're right on the edge if you read me. We're getting a lot of static. If you'll just hang on a minute, we'll be back in to some calm air. Gene, Houston, go ahe ad.
|CAPCOM|We're just standing by for your comments you wanted to make when we lost comm there a minute. We're back with you.
|SC|Okay, Bob. The entire boost itself was not unlike what you - Stu - down there understand. The physical cues, what have you, but the significant part of going at night is that as soon as we'did have ignition down there APOLLO .17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:40 GET 21:07 MC129/2 in the bottom of the SIC stack, even though I only have a little slit out of the rendezvous window here, and Ron doesn't have much of a hole in the boost protective cover out of the hatch window, we could definitely confirm ignition because we could see the reflected lights on out through — in front of us. It was by no means blinding, of course, we had the cockpit pretty well lit. We — as soon as we lifted off, that light immediately went behind us. We came into SIC staging, and I had an opportunity to say "I told you so" to Jack and Ron. It was just like the great train wrecks of the past. I definitely could see the S2 ignite, and, then, of course, I could see the significance of the reflection through the window. Besides all the other cues we had for ignition, very much like the SIC lit up the windows on the stack. Power jet was pretty spectacular. I could see out the entire boost protective cover, and some flames from somewhere — I'm not sure — maybe it was through the hole in the window — but I could definitely see it. Of course, it disappeared in short order. When the SII shut down, the delay time between shutdown there and the S-IVB igniting, the entire flame overtook us, and we literally flew through the SII flame when the S-IVB ignited, if you can imagine that. It's very similar to the Titan staging where you actually fly through the fireball on the SII, And, that's something you never see — none of those things you ever see quite that way in daylight. On the S-IV I could see — of course, once we got going, I couldn't see any light from that plume again, but we could see the APS firing all the way through the burn, and once we got in orbit, as other guys have seen, you could see the APS firing that night without any difficulty. One of the most significant things about TLI is the fact that we, of course, started at night and flew right on up and through a sunrise which in itself was a pretty spectacular thing, but, when you do it during a TLI burn it even adds a little bit momentum to your effort,.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. Any comment you might make on the possibility of picking up your yaw, if you'd lost your platform that time — remember the discussion we had about the yaw in the late like a mode force went in?
|SC|Yeah, Bob. I not only will comment. I was aware of it, and I was looking for it, and during parts of the SII and parts of the S-IVB burn, I even turned the lights down in the cockpit in hopes that I could see stars out there, but I could not make out a one. Ron, I think, maybe saw Saturn out the overhead hatch, but looking through the rendezvous window during a boost phase during a time-critical phase like a Mode 2 or Mode 4, I am very much afraid that we would not have been able to pick up that reference.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:40 GET 21:07 MC129/3
021:07:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|As I remember it, as low as I had the interior lights there for a period of time, and I didn't want to keep them that low, of course, to see if I could get adapted very fast, because we were in a dynamic phase of the burn, but my window just gave me a very deep purplish hue, a hue of which I could not, literally, see through to look to see any stars at alL. Now, that may have been due to the very low intensity of our interior flood lights.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:53 GET 21:07 MC130/1
021:07:00|SC|Bob, this; is Jack. A little lay im pression there, I think I saw just about everything Gene was talking about as far as his description and felt like it was - although everthing was an imazing experience, each one in itself, after each one was over, you could think back and say: "Yeah, that's what other guys said it was like." The old Saturn V has got to be a pretty consistently performing vehicle. But with the added night time contrast, I think it made it probably the best ride any three guys have ever had.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, I might add, that the S-l was, as usual, pretty shakey on lift off I saw all the maneuvers as I called 'em out to yaw and the small reverse roll. Going through Max q, I .got up to 25 percent, but my yaw attitude was error zero and my pitch attitude error probably wasn't even at oh, certainly less than 2 degrees. After max q she smoothed out by comparison quite a bit and the S-II was a very quiet ride, a very smooth ride. However, you are always aware, due to just a little rumbling out in the S-IVB, that she was still burning for you. The S-IVB I think was just a continually rumble, but smooth or consistent ride all the way through GLI.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gee! I think one of the big things that impressed me was the - how instantaneous the dece11 erations were of each one of the boosters when they cut off. That included the S-IV TOI cut off. No physical appreciation of tail off at all. Hey, Bob, from my rendezvous from the right hand rendezvous window when the tall jet occurred, there seemed to be a lot of burning particles streaming away from it. I could not see - did not notice - remember seeing the actual cover or tower itself, but we were inside the cone of the burn and with a lot of streaming, it looked very much like a sky rocket. Portion of one at any rate. Reminded me of the 4th of July out in Silver City a few years ago.
|CAPCOM|Roger
|CAPCOM|Say, any time you got your flight plan handy, I've got a discussion here I'd like to run through here with you now on how we're going to recover those 2 hours and 40 minutes from the launch delay and you'll need to copy it into the flight plan, and then just want you to be advised we're not happy with the PTC, we get a half angle of about 17 degrees and so sometime after the P-52 coming up in 2300 we'll want to do another PTC, or initiate PTC again.
|SC|Well, that was the commander who initiated PTC and I've already heard about that. You bet he has. Okay. We've got the flight plan here, Bob. Which part of it are you talking about?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:53 GET 21:07 MC130/2
021:07:00|CAPCOM|Well, let's just talk some words here for a minute and then I'll go through some specifics you can just write down on a page cause you don't want to do it until a little later. Okay, what: we're going to set up here, you will arrive at lunar orbit at the same GMT time to landing sun angle, sun elevation angle, and the camera settings and everything will be unchanged when you get to Lunar orbit. To compensate for the 2 hours 40 minute late launch we're going to tack 2 hours and 40 minutes out of the time line and we're going to, they'll be out of the TLC timeline. We're going to do it in two groups, and this is where you might want to start copying now, Ron. Delete 1 hour from 46 to 47; from 46 to 47 we're just going to delete the activities that are presently scheduled at 4630 to 4700, you'll perform at 45; move those to 45. Let me read that again. Delete 1 hour from 4600 to 4700. The activities that are listed at 4630 to 4700 perform at 4500.
|SC|Okay, Bob, looks like we'delete 1 hour from 46 to 47 hours and then the activities that are at 4630 do those at 4500.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron, and then starting at 47, just take, just scratch 1 hour off of each time, just subract 1 hour from each of those times up through 66 hours. Subtract 1 hour from 47 up through 66.
|SC|Okay, we can do that. Subtract 1 hour from 47 to 66 hours.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and just for your information you won't have to do it, but we're going to play the old simulator step—ahead game at 66 hours to the old time which will be 65 hours of the new time to however you want to call it, we'll call you when we're going to SINC you up at 6 740 at that point.
|SC|tfe'll play the old step—ahead game there. Okay, Bob. That means that you're not going to actually do any clock updates or SINC's until somewhere in the 60's there and not in the 40's.
|CAPCOM|P.oger, it'll be 65 hours of the new time or 66 hours of the old time, depends on how you want to look at it. But that's when we'll SINC you up.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|You'll be in SINC all the way out to that time, just, we're just going to delete and jump you to 6740. And just another note of interest, you don't have to write this down, but let's see I'll read it to you. The awake periods will be on days 3, you'll be 15 hours, 8 hours sleep starting at 11:33 CST; then at Day 4 you'll be 14 and 20 hours with 8 hours sleep. So you'd actually just shorten a couple days there.
|SC|Okay, mighty fine.
|CAPCOM|The beauty of that that Tommy came up with on that, Ron, is that all you have to do is go subtract those one hours and no more reading or anything else, just subtract them and we're in business.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 20:53 GET 21:07 MC130/3
021:07:00|SC|Yeah, it looks real fine.
|CAPCOM|We're going to give Tommy a gold star for that one.
|SC|Ah, huh, you bet. Ah, come, this is Jack, I'm going to try and get a little exercise. I'd be interested to know how high I get my heart rate just fooling around up here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, if we can --- We'll keep you posted, Jack.
|SC|Bob, just to keep you and the people there thinking a little bit, today is a relatively short day, but it is a good day, because it gives us a chance to again get acclimated and finish our stowage and just generally go through all the things that have to be going through for the rest of the mission. We've got three eating days today, and judging from what we're thinking and talking about now, that the last two are going to be sort of stretched into one eating period because three meals, on this particular day just is not going to be stamachable.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we understand that.
|SC|I think you'll find out that our eating and drinking for the most part is starting off relatively slow but I think we'll pick it up by tomorrow.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 21:30 CST 21:05 MC131/1
021:30:00|SC|Bob, one other thing while I'm thinking about it, the PU shifts were all noticeable, but probably the one that really caught me a little bit by surprise was the PU shift on the S-IVB during TLI.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It just felt like you lit in the other burner.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|CAPCOM|Just for Jack's information, you're running in the 80's on your heartbeat. We saw a 91 or 2 there for a few minutes. Are you working, still working out?
|SC|Yes. That's sort of discouraging.
|CAPCOM|I'm sorry (garble).
|SC|Hey, Bob, what was Jack running before he start ed th at .
|CAPCOM|He was running in the 60's, the count's some where in the mid 60's,
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. You're running about 105 and 103 right now. Kind of interesting, Jack. You slowed down, then you're back up to 105 right now. How you're slowing down again.
|PAO|Flight surgeon John Zeigelschmitt is watching the heart rate of Jack Schmitt, as Jack exercises aboard the spacecraft using a modified exerciser, that consists primarily of a cylinder and a cord that comes out of it allows him to adjust the amount of tension or resistance to pull that the device has, and there are a variety of ways in which it can be used, allowing him to pull against the adjustable tension. This bungee like device, and he's gotten his heart rate up somewhat in excess of 100 beats per minute .

This is aimed among other things at keeping the cardio vascular system which tends to get lazy in zero gravity in condit ion.
|CAPCOM|Team we've got a serious one here you might be interested. All that exercise banging around in there has destratified tank 3 02 so it stirred it all up good.
|SC|Yes, glad we brought him along then we found some use for him. Once an EEC0M always an EECOM. I have to create my own g in order to run in place.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|How high up did the heart rate get, Bob?
|CAPCOM|We got you at a 140, Jack. Were you running in place?
|SC|140 was that - yeah, I was underneath the righthand couch holding on to the main YY strut with my hands and running against the LEB.
|CAPCOM|Roger, it worked real well 140 and you were running in the mid 60's so you picked up to about almost 70 beats there no problem. The surgeon is very happy.
|SC|Roger, well I'm happy too. It took a while to find a technique I was - initially I got up to 90 with just isometrics pushing against the couch and the running is obviously what it takes.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|But I don't - Bob I don't I really don't feel I guess I lost you.
|SC|Hello Houston, 17 are you still there?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're with you we had a little comm problem there as you know, coming on this as we're changing on the antenna.
|SC|Okay, what's the heart beat right now?
|CAPCOM|Right at, stand by. We had a data drop out, Jack, that's why I'm holding up. And it just came on we'll tell you in a second here. About 60 Jack right about 6 0 even.
|SC|Okay, that's where I was when I started so you certainly recover fast. I don't know if that's faster than in one g or not.
|CAPCOM|Well, we're happy with it, or the surgeon is happy with it so it's good.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 21:16 GET 21:43 132/2
021:43:00|SC|Well, I just how does that compare - do we have any data how that compares with the recovery - say the five minute recovery time on the ergometer.
|CAPCOM|We can look it up, Jack if your interested We'll have to check your records they don't have it right in fron t of us.
|SC|No big deal I was just curious.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Jack, just for your information the surgeons pulled out the recovery rate data and the same with our data which is a little rough here it's the same zero g as your 1 g odometer data.
|SC|Okay, that's very interesting.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, since we've got a few moments to talk which I know we won't have later in the mission something I don't ever remember happening, but it's happening now in the windows. That's the 1, 3, and 5 but not 2 and 4 is that in the center of the window about 6 or 8 inches in diameter as you come through the night side of the rotation you pick up a very light - oh, you might call it even a frost. Very light frost on the window more like a moisture frost film of moisture or a film of frost not very thick like crystals at all as you come through the sunlight it tends to sublime away, but you never fully lose until you go back into darkness again. The very artistic definite ice crystals that we had on my number 1 window here yesterday I think we reported to you this morning that they were gone or sublimed away. But the impression they left on the window is still there very sharp and very evident.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 22:01 CST 21:36 MC133/1
022:01:00|SC|Bob, I don't know whether you were copying Honeysuckle's call to us, while you lost COM there for awhile.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy.
|SC|But they said that they had (garble) okay.
|CAPCOM|They kind of concurred with your weather report the re, Jack.
|SC|Oh, lucky guess. I might say that the sub, the zero phase point that we're looking at is right at the northeast coast of Australia and it's much brighter. It's a very bright point now, oh, it's hard to say how far across. But, quite unlike what I mentioned being in the vicinity of the Samoan Islands earlier. And it's right at the shore and it could be just that the shore area has somewhat choppier seas. So maybe, maybe the brightness of that point is a function of sea state, although I don't know exactly what type of seas it would take to brighten it up. I suspect choppy seas are better than long swells.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|That front is - seems to have slowed down it's progress. It's about in the same position, possibly slightly farther north than when I started talking about it this morning. The waves seems to be developing off the - now off the southwest coast of New Zealand. It's much more pronounced than it was. Definitely seems to now have a slight cyclonic pattern - clockwise pattern. And I wouldn't be surprised if the next couple of days that moves along the front over towards Sidney. And maybe a little farther north than that might - Brubane is probably more likely.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Now except I got the movement wrong again. Although it does seem to have progressed west from New Zealand.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I take back what I said about forcasting Sidney's weather. I think that will - I would suspect that would move to the northeast like - now that I look it seems like an earlier front, which is partly disipated, has the same kind of motion and now lies considerably north and east of the one I've been talking about.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Thinking back on some weather briefings we had last week, Bob, are you there?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|I'll talk to you later. I think you're - we're losing you for a little bit here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We're reading you loud and clear right now. Oh, you're going out a little bit now.
|SC|You back with us Bob?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 22:01 CST 21:36 MC 133/2
022:01:00|SC|Okay, I'm going to try to recover there from that last few statements, As I recall, the weather briefings that we had at the Cape last week, that - talking with Ken Nabor and Jim Nicholson down there, that the patterns that we were seeing from the satellite pictures in their forcast, or analysis anyway, charts in the New Zealand part of the Pacific, those waves formed along the front would move north and then curve east. And that appears to be the pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. And I suspect that that pattern would hold with the wave that's developed off the coast - right on the coast of New Zealand now. It might move on up the western coast of New Zealand. We'll probably have a chance to watch that in the next few days and see what happens to it.
|CAPCOM|Roger Jack.
|SC|Houston, how are you reading now?
|CAPCOM|Reading you loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, Bob. As I look at the clock, we're - just 24 hours ago we were within our hold somewhere. For this period yesterday we were in our hold, and I think it goes without saying, but we'd sure like to pass on our bit of gratitude and thanks for the response that the people down at the Cape came up with. And particularly at Marshall. I think we all knew no one would be going anywhere unless everyone was satisfied that we were going all the way, and that's certainly the way we felt, but we'do want to thank everybody there for making that come true.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. I think it was a superb show between the Cape and Marshall and Houston and probably with Goddard with the network and just about everybody concerned, really. Had to do some work there to bring it off. And it went off real smoothly.
|SC|Yeah. After flying with Stafford a couple of times and having that happen a few times back, I thought maybe he was aboard.
|CAPCOM|(Chuckle) Okay. I think that was a first for getting a Saturn V to 30 seconds before ignition and - or rather actually 30 seconds before liftoff and holding there.
|SC|It got mighty quiet on board about 30 seconds.
|CAPCOM|I sure imagine.
|SC|We all felt like old hands the second time around, though.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, I've been at that 30 second count one other time and it's no different the second time around.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|But we'do appreciate the work and I think it's typical of - of what made this manned space program such a super program. The responce of people like that.
|CAPCOM|We concur with that Gene, wholeheartedly
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 21:49 GET 22:15 MC134/1
022:15:00|SC|And with that in mind tell everyone to stick around because there's a lot left to be done.
|CAPCOM|You had better believe it,
|SC|The old accumulator cycle again, I guess, gang.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're seeing it. It looks like you have master alarm. Is that at firm?
|SC|Yes sir, that's how we've (garble). Although it doesn't happen all the time and I guess as long as whenever we have that waste vent closed, we probably wouldn't be bothered by it at night.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's - that's our feelings here, Jack. Say, Gene and Ron, I talked to your fraus on the phone here a little while ago and they gave me a very interesting observation you might appreciate. They were standing close to some water when launch when they noticed that when the booster lit up there was something scared all the fish because the water literally began to boil with fish jumping from the light, I guess, or from the shockwave or something. It must have made a very distinct impression because that's the first thing both of them told me about.
|SC|Yeah, that's pretty neat,
|CAPCOM|A neat way to go scare up the fish, I guess.
|SC|Right. How are they doing today, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Really fine. Really fine. They're just like I said. However, they're tickled pink and Barbara said that she wants you to know she's going into quarantine until after the weekend here, until after the landing.
|SC|If she goes into quarantine, that'll be a s pace first.
|CAPCOM|Roger. You got to be careful about all this .
|SC|You know what to tell them - go ahead, Bob .
|CAPCOM|You got to be careful now - the hotboxes are open - the hotlines are open at the houses there so everything you say is being listened to.
|SC|Yeah, okay, in that case, just want to say hello and we're having a super good time looking forward to what's coming, and we thank you for the news Robert.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And my Impression of the World philo sophically, I suppose you'll be getting from time to time, but it sure hasn't changed.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|It's sure beautiful. It's sure beauti ful and, looking back at it, there's several billion people who have got a lot t:o work for because it's one of the most beautiful sights we've ever seen here.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. You guys are sounding great and doing real great. You're pressing right along here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 22:15 CST 21:49 MC 134/2
022:15:00|SC|I just want to emphasize, Bob, that these first two days - of course, yesterday was a pretty good day, but today we're catching up and, as I say, on the food consumption, don't be expecting too much.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Acclimation and familiarity, stowage and preparation, and enjoyment and relaxation - are ready to call it a day today which is probably the most ideal day in the flight plan to put it because it's probably the only one we'll h ave.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Not that they aren't all going to be enjoyable. Hey, Bob, your hourly weather report is due and I'll wait awhile. I keep losing your COMM.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Bob, are you there?
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, we're standing by.
|SC|Okay, I had a quick look and just to bring you up to date, we're starting to be able to see the coast of Asia. The Phillipines are wide open today and the that tropical storm Theresa, I mentioned I thought 1 could see -indeed I'm sure that's what that little concentrated mass of clouds was north of New Guinea. And I suspect, although I didn't get a good fix on it, that the folks in Guam may be in for some heavy weather.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Oh, and Bob, I got another pair of pictures and that would be up to 134.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's on November, November, is that affirm?
|SC|That's affirm.
|CAPCOM|(garble).
|SC|And that was taken the last pass about 10 minutes ago if you want to keep track of GET.
|CAPCOM|Roger, thanks, Jack, I'm doing that. Here's some information for Ron, in particular. We've evaluated the data from the mapping camera and pah camera cycling there and it looks real good. Everything looks right normal.
|SC|Hey, that's outstanding good deal.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 22:05 CST 22:31 GET MC135/1
022:31:00|SC|Bob, how do you read 17?
|CAPCOM|17, read you 5 by.
|SC|That's strangest sounding Bob I've ever heard.
|CAPCOM|He's taking a short break.
|SC|Okay. Good. Nice to talk with you. Hey, I don't know whether you were Gene the other day when talking about the circulation patterns around Antartica. We were looking then at the Indian Ocean, or actually the south Atlantic in the Indian Ocean region, and you see the same pattern at about the same latitudes, say 60 degree south, where all the linear cloud patterns which presumably are - reflect the various cold fronts have - are arcuate with their convex sides, or actually almost pointed sides - are all lined up in a west-east direction around that latitude. It's quite a spectacular appearing circulation pattern and the little wave that I mentioned on New Zealand seems to be - beginning to form another arrow or another convex point on that front that's fitting right into the same circulation pattern.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy.
|SC|That would make four of those major convex fronts that I can see from this view crossing south of Australia up into the South Pacific.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|On that tropical storm that was Teresa, I don't know if they're still calling it now - that now, but I'm not sure it may be a little south of Guam. Guam may not be in trouble with that one.
|SC|It looks like its just a bit to the west of Manila there about 5 or 6 degrees no more than that though. It looks like it's about 5 degrees west of Manila and about 5 degrees south. And it is still called Teresa.
|SC|Okay, Gene, if you're still there, I don't like to argue with you but I think our analysis chart is a little mo re up to date.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|That area that you just mentioned is very clear now. East of the Philippines. Did you say west or east of the Philippines?
|CAPCOM|West of the Philippines.
|SC|Okay, that: area that you mentioned, 5 degrees east is very clear and the center of teh - the - what appears to be the storm that I'm speaking of would be about 142 longitude and may be 8 degrees north latitude.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Which would put it south of Guam.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Yeah, you're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then.
|SC|Say again, Gene?
|CAPCOM|You're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then. You're saying it would be just about due west of the Carolines, then.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 22:05 CST 22:31 GET MC 135/2
022:31:00|SC|Yes,sir.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Yeah, you're probably looking at a - oh, I don't know - maybe a what - a 12 hour old prog, or something?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's the one I had for launch day.
|SC|Okay, well its moved quite a bit now, and I guess its the same storm, still seems to be very well organized but quite concentrated and small.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll get a new prog in and compare your estimate, there.
|SC|Okay, I think that's pretty good - those 142 and 8 degrees would be pretty good center of that storm. That's a pretty good - I can see Mindanao and I can see the - let's see - just a second - what is that on Australia? Yeah, of course, that is Port Moresby. I can see that point there and it's between those two - I can pin that one down probably within a couple of degrees.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'll get a satellite photo and bring it in here in just a bit.
|PAO|The conversation over the past few minutes has been between Flight Director, Gene Kranz, and Jack Schmitt. Apollo 17 at this time, almost directly above the northeast coast of Australia - some 94 000 nautical miles from earth.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 22:19 GET 22:44 MC 136/1
022:44:00|SC|Ah, Houston, caster number 4 is in Bravo now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
|SC|Houston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead 17.
|SC|Okay, Bob, that storm off the - just off the southwest coast of New Zealand is still intensifying and has both high and low level clouds you can see by shadow lines. It looks like it may go into pretty fair storm system. Borneo is very clear today and the Phillipines, as I mentioned, it looks like a very strong frontal system that stretches from, oh, let's say the south coast of, southeast coast of Viet Nam up between the Phillipines and tawan and across tawan and right along and I can't tell, I think just off - just south of Japan, I can't tell whether Japan is in the front or not, I'll look at it some more. The strongest storm center that I can see on that is way north and probably Hokkaido has a fair amount of weather from that storm system. There seems to be a tropical depression just north of Borneo, very strong circulation system north of Borneo and I guess just south of Viet Nam.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Probably southeast. I hadn't noticed it before, but it is extremely concentrated northern hemisphere cyclone pattern. I don't know whether that's on your prog or not. That's not what's left of Sally is it?
|CAPCOM|Standby, let me look at the prog over here, Jack Okay, we - it doesn't show on the old one, the new one is coming in here shortly, Jack,
|SC|Okay, if that is a developing depression it's approaching Luzon and not very far away - 2 or 3 degrees of longitude now, but Luzon is clear.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I can see Korea quite well, Bob. It's clear today.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we've got the fronts, the leading of the front on our prog was past Korea and on Japan and you've got it moving quiet a bit further east there.
|SC|Well, I'm not absolutely sure - master alarm on the accumulator -
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy.
|SC|I can't make out Japan specifically yet, but it's clearly past Korea and by inspection it looks like it would be also past Japan by now, the trailing edge of the front. However, the circulation center on further northeast maybe effecting the Hokkaido, as I said.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Like I said, the front on the old prog for yesterday showed that front on the other side of Japan, so it moved across pretty well.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 22:19 GET 22:44 MC 136/2
022:44:00|SC|As I recall they bad a tropical storm called Sally that went into (garble) a few days ago and so I suspect this new one that I think I see between Borneo and Viet Nam maybe something else, a new depression or I may be fooled by it. Mainland China, Bob, was - on the last pass here, I can't see the Earth now, but mainland China looked like it was clear as far as I could see but there might be another front quiet a ways inland, but that gets right at the LM and I can't tell, but Korea, Yellow Sea and the regions of China, south of there, Shanghai, Nan King and those places look as though they are quiet clear today. I'll check that again next time around.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And, Jack, we are ready to terminate the charge on battery B and start the charge on battery A.
|SC|Okay, that should work.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 23:02 CST 22:37 MC 137/1
023:02:00|SC|Houston, for your information, system test 7A is about . 6 .
|CAPCOM|Say that again, Jack, sounds like I heard a .6 on system test 7A?
|SC|That's affirm, battery compartment pressure.
|CAPCOM|Thank you Jack.
|SC|Okay, Bob, battery A is being charged now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Bob, have you got any of the LMies in there today?
|CAPCOM|Any of your LMies. Roger, they're all sitting by. Just gave me a big thumbs up, Jack.
|SC|Okay, give them a thumbs up on the rendezvous radar antenna. It looks real good.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I'm nose to nose with it practically here at about 2 feet and it's extremely clean and I see absolutely no sign of anything abnormal with it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Matter of fact, compared to some of the flaking problems and things like that we heard about in the past, I never saw a cleaner piece of hardware than that LM looks right n ow.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Appropriately, finally, we're getting - we're starting to use it during the Christmas season. It sure looks like a Christmas package with all the orange tape on it.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Ron, we've got your NOUN 05
|SC|Okay, I'll go ahead and accept that one this t i me.
|CAPCOM|We got the 9 degrees, Ron, and you can torq ue.
|SC|Okay, I'll torque it to the 9 foot.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got it. And, Jack, we've been looking at our records. we'don't have a previous system test reading for 7 Alpha. Do you recall of any previous reading?
|SC|Yeah, that looks like another accumulator cycle - had our master alarm.
|CAPCOM|we'dropped data just then, Jack, so we can't concur or confirm it.
|CAPCOM|That was exactly the right time (garble).
|SC|Bob, you cut out about your system test meter discussion.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Do you have any previous 7 Alpha readings? we'don't have any in our log here written. We're just wondering Vhat the past reading from that was,
|SC|No, I think that was the first one we would have been called to make after a battery charge, right?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 23:02 CST 22:37 MC 137/2
023:02:00|CAPCOM|That's affirm, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack, you're coming in very weak.
|SC|Well, I didn't intend to be transmitting. We were just discussing the battery vent and things. We may have missed something in the dump checklist. We111 check it out.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'don't think so. We just thought maybe you might have read it earlier.
|SC|Oh, yeah, you want the battery vent it should be closed now, right?
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by, Jack.
|SC|Okay, Ron says it ought to be open.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. It should be open.
|SC|Let me just check -
|CAPCOM|There's no question about that. It should b e open.
|SC|Okay, it's open.
|CAPCOM|There's no problem, Jack. It should be open but the value appears a bit low to us and we'd like to read it again before you go to sleep or we may want to close it. And the nominal reading would be 1.7 on that.
|SC|( g arb le )
|SC|Okay, we closed it when we were doing all our dumping some time back and neglected to open it again. So, it was closed when I gave you the reading and it has been closed during some 2 hours anyway. I haven't figured out how long.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. Jack, would you mind opening the vent and watching the system meter concurrently with it?
|SC|Standby. Well, it's closed now and it's still reading what it - .6. Do you want us to open it again?
|CAPCOM|Rog- Open the vent and -
|SC|I mean, it's open now. I'm sorry, Bob. It is now open and reading .6. It read .6 when it was closed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just leave it open now.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|And we'll want to still check it prior to your sleep period.
|SC|Okay. Okay, Bob, a little update on the coast of Asia. It looks like some residual cloudiness would be affecting the Pusan region of Korea. And, also, that's residual after the frontal passage. And it looks like maybe Shanghai, after all, may have some storms associated with it but it's really hard to pick out exactly - the exact coast line of Asia, but I - there are some clouds in the Yellow Sea behind the front. Look like they might be possibly some high cirrus is all.
|CAPCOM|Jack, do you still see that storm that you said was sitting between Guam and Borneo and that area?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 GET 23:02 CST 22:37 MC 137/3
023:02:00|SC|Okay, I see there is this cloud concentration between New Guinea and Guam. The more I look at it the less well developed it appears to me compared to some of the other circulation patterns. It could be just a residual depression from Theresa that has moved out into that area. It is an isolated, a relatively isolated cloud pattern, fairly small, but apparently fairly dense, and it does not have a strong cyclonic pattern to it. Nothing at all like the pattern that now exists above Borneo and seems to be moving towards Luzon.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 22:52 GET 23:19 MC 138/1
023:19:00|SC|Okay, Houston. We're moving in the pieces of the pre-sleep checklist. Here's one more readout for you. Battery C is 37.0; Pyro Bat A is 37.2; Pyro Bat B is 37.2; RCS A 95; Bravo 94; Charlie 94; Delta is 96.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that. And if you started - we don't want you to reinitialize the PTC until about 2400 on the ' ti me line.
|SC|Okay. We're - we're just getting a little ahead - we - took us longer last night on the pre-sleep than we expected. We're trying to work it out again.
|CAPCOM|Yeah. we'don't to - we want to terminate the waste stowage vent at that time, because we think that that vent is what's contributing to our PTC.
|SC|Okay. We're - we're not - we're not really ready to go to sleep yet, but we're just moving ahead.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And if it's okay, I'll cycle the H2 fans.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're standing by.
|SC|Okay, the fans are off.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours 25 minutes. The crew has completed realigning the inertial measurement platform-the platform used as a stable reference. The spacecraft guidance and control system uses it as a reference in determining its own attitude. They've also been charging the two entry batteries that are used during peak electrical loads of liftoff, and then are recharged during the translunar coast when the fuel cells are producing a surplus of electrical energy. They recharged one of those two batteries and are in the process of recharging the second one at this time. And you heard the crew describe going into their pre-sleep checklist and getting things aboard the spacecraft configured for the sleep period, which is scheduled to begin at 25 hours ground elapsed time or a little more than 1-1/2 hours from now. Apollo 17 at this time is 96 244 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at 5 264 feet per second. And all spacecraft systems continue to function almost perfectly as planned. A little while ago the lunar module officer - control officer - confirmed from telemetry what Gene Cernan was reporting visually out the window and that is that the lunar module appears to be in very good shape. Of course we have a limited number of telemetry readings on the LM at this point . But one of them that we'do have gives us an indication of the integrity or tightness of the LM cabins. We can see that in the amount of pressure decaying. It appears to be a very tight vehicle.
|CAPCOM|Say, Jack, we got a request in here from our ARIA friends.
|SC|Go ahead.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 22:52 GET 23:19 MC 138/2
023:19:00|CAPCOM|They were just wondering if your looking out that way, if you could give them some sort of update of what the weather in the Wake I s 1 an d —Kwa j ale in — the south of the Wake area look like.
|SC|Okay. Let me work on that one.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You're going to earn your American meteorological society badge pretty quick.
|SC|Okay. Let me get the monocular and we'll look at Wake Island. I miss having all those nice lati t ude - Ion gi t ude lines on the globe.
|CAPCOM|Yes sir.
|PAO|The ARIA friends that CAPCOM, Robert Overmile, is refering to, are the crews of the Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft used in supplementing the manned spaceflight network coverage. They'll be leaving from Patrick Airforce Base prior to the end of the mission and flying into the Wake Island area to be on station during Apollo 17's reentry and splashdown.
|SC|Okay, Bob, I'll probably have to work on this one a little more, but - but it looks like around Wake, or in the vicinity of the Kw a j ale in ' s an d north of W ak e , ab out all you have is a lot of cloudiness although — and in a generally — over wide part of that Pacific, I'm talking about 15 or 20 degrees of longitude and latitude, there's a - roughly a clock a - clockwise circulation pattern, but the clouds do not look very dense or concentrated in any one area. And leading off to the southeast from that general cloud mass there cyclonic - anti cyclonic cloud mass is a - is one of the old fronts — or at least one of the old linear cloud patterns that extends down into the south Pacific.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. I'm sure that the ARIA troups are listening down at Patrick and got all of that.
|SC|Well my guess is, Bob, and it's purely a guess, is that there probably - if they were out there right now, would be experiencing an intermediate layer of clouds with scattered showers. And a not too strongly developed circulation system, so I can't predict the winds. But I wouldn't expect them to be anything - anything what might be down - associated with the remnants of the tropical depression Th res a. Now that Th res a ~ what's left of it, if I'm correct in picking it out there, probably is moving in that direction, although it looks weak enough that right now I don't think it would be any big problem. It may, in fact, go south of there.
|CAPCOM|Roger. The prog I got in my hand for three hour old weather has Thresa located just about in the Manila area. Did you concur with that or do you think it passed the Philippines?
|SC|Well, I don't - Manila's clear. The only thing approaching near Manila is this other storm center that Is now north of Borneo. And to the east of Manila it's clear all the way over to this little cloud mass that I was guessing that might be Thresa.
|CAPCOM|Roger. All I say, this is 3 hours old -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 22:52 GET 23:19 MC 138/3
023:19:00|SC|That's about - I gave Gene Kranz the coordinates on it. You can look it up. Those are pretty good coordinates for that cloud mass. Now whether that's really Thresa or not I don't know.
|CAPCOM|We got one thing with - for the last couple of hours here, we've been getting high bit rats data through our new facility - a new facility at Tidbinbilla. Tidbinbilla is through a 210 dish arid they're covering the first -
|SC|Wake in the Kwajalein - Marshall Islands, in that area, and it doesn't look like a very concentrated weather pattern, although it looks like you'll have ceilings in that region, and they're overcast ceilings rather than broken. Except around the fringes of it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|We'11 keep an eye on it of courese.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 CST 23:12 GET 23:37 MC 139/1
023:37:00|CAPCOM|Jack, how do you read us now?
|SC|You're on clear.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, for the last 2 hours we've been getting high bit rate data from a new facility, the facility at Kid Ben Villa and they working their first Apollo flight ever, you might give them a cheery hello.
|SC|Kid Ben Villa, is that corre ct ?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. It's very close to the Honeysuckle Base —
|SC|Where is that.
|CAPCOM|Very close to Honeysuckle.
|SC|Well, how you doing, how you doing mights? We certainly appreciate you guys being on the loop for this one.
|PAO|That new 210 foot dish antenna at Kid Ben Villa, which is near Honeysuckle Creek, which in turn is near Canberra, now on line and accounting for our excellent signal strikes on the spacecraft. Apollo 17 at this time is 96 958 nautical miles from Earth. The speed is 5 233 feet per second.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, we'd like ACCEPT and will update your gyro drift, the pitch roll and yaw drifts.
|SC|Okay, got ACCEPT IN POO.

|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|The computer is yours. Gene.
|SC|Go ahead, we're reading you.
|CAPCOM|Go to attitude and reinitialize PTC when ever you want to .
|SC|Okay. Did you mean to leave the computer with verb 21901 on.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's your computer with - as you got it.
|SC|Okay, that's right. That's 1462. Okay.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Roger, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Rog. We've got a reccommended configuration for your H2 fans and H2 heaters. We would like the H2 heaters 1 and 2 to auto and H2 fans 1 and 2 off, 3 to auto. Your 02 heaters look good1,
|SC|Okay. Let me verify that I've got these right. H2 heaters 1, 2 auto. 02 heaters, 1 off 2 off 3 auto. H2 fans - H2 fans you want off, off, and auto. Is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's what we want on the H2 fans and the 02 is fine. You've got it.
|SC|Okay, they're off, off - Okay, H2 fans are off, off and auto.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack.
|SC|Okay, Bob. I just cleaned the SID circuit return valve screen, here. It: was probably, as expected, a little crud on it. A few things have collected but they're really not too bad.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Bob, a little more about Wake and the Marshalls and Kwajalein. That large pattern of - would appear to be broken to overcast clouds in a clockwise circulation pattern - crosses the equator region now that I've tried to project that through.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|I 7 , go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. When you stop the present roll on the PTC to reinitialize, pick a roll angle of 315 or 130 for stopping so that we have good comm during the damping period.
|SC|Okay. 315 o r 12 0, ok ay ?
|CAPCOM|130, Ron.
|SC|Okay. 315 or 130.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that will give us good comm to watch the data on the damping.
|SC|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, now 24 hours after liftoff and Apollo 17, 97 917 nautical miles from earth. The crew, at the present time, is stopping the passive thermal control mode. They'll be reestablishing it. It had begun to diverge a little bit - it had begun to wobble about the axis. The concern in going to sleep with that sort of situation is that it will wobble through the point at which they would have gimbal lock and of course we would wake them up before then but in order to avoid having to disturb the crew's sleep they'd like to get the passive thermal control very stable, so that it will hold up during the entire sleep period.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/7/72 23:16 CST 23:41 GET MC 140/2
023:41:00|SC|How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, 17.
|SC|Okay, we're at 300, do you want us to go to 315 yet or is 300 going to be okay?
|CAPCOM|That's good enough, Gene, and we'd like you to close your waste vent at this time, please.
|SC|Okay, its closed now.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And 17, Houston. We've got the same reccommendation, We reccommend Alpha and Bravo for damping, Bravo and Delta for spinup. Over.
|SC|Okay, Alpha and Bravo for damping and Bravo and Delta for spinup.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, If one of you want to break out the flight plan supplement, we have a change to the E-loads on page 143 due to the change of gyro-compensation parameters if you want to copy them down when you get something off.
|SC|Okay, we'll give you a call.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'll be standing by.
|SC|Okay, Bob, we're on our damping cycle n ow .
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're watching you, Gene.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're in the midst of turning over the shift now to Mission Control, to the team of Flight Director, Pete Frank. Gene Kranz and his team will be going off shift in about 25 minutes. we'do not plan to have a change of shift Press Briefing. The crew aboard Apollo 17 is scheduled to begin an 8 hour sleep period in a little less than one hour at a ground elapsed time of 25 hours. And we have no major activities in the flight plan before that time. At 24 hours 9 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

|CAPCOM|Oh, okay, I'm sorry, it's closed.
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17.
|SC|Forget it, we got it. I was left out.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Bob, on the film status, we are still where we were, November - November 134 and I'll probably take 2 more pictures before I go to sleep.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy.
|CAPCOM|And, 17 , if one of you are down in the LEB could you give us a readout on system test 7 ALPHA.
|SC|Stand by. Okay, Houston, 17, 7 ALPHA is point 6.
|CAPCOM|Roger, 7 ALPHA equals point 6.
|SC|Okay, Houston, 17, are we configured properly now1for COMM?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I'm on OMNI bravo right now.
|CAPCOM|We're in good shape on the Comm and we'll be controlling the OMNI.
|SC|Roger, Bob.
|CAPCOM|17 the rates look great, we're ready to initial PTC.
|SC|Okay, Bob.
|SC|Okay, Bob, PTC is initiated.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene, we copjr and we watch the rol1 s tar t.
|SC|Hello, Houston, I think we've got every thing done on the checklist, the water has been chlorinated, we re in PTC1and I think Jack picked up every thing else. How does it look to you?
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene, let us make our check through the room here and ; us t a reminder that I've got that addition on the E loads for the flight plan supplements.
|SC|Stand by, Jack's gonna keep the headset on and the biomed and he'll close you out with that and if there're nothing else I'm going to go off the air.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene,

The Lunar Module Pilot, Jack Schmitt, will be wearing the communications headset and the biomedical harness for the sleep period tonight.
|SC|Bob, Jack, your last report for the day as the Earth goes past window 5. The first thing I noticed was that our zero face point is not nearly as bright on the west coast of Australia as it was on the east and it's looking right at the coast line now and see no bright spot in the center. Also that circulation pattern or tropical depression possibly that I saw earlier north of Borneo is now even more strongly developed and the tail end of the front is searching up toward Japan and it, it really looks like a humdinger from here. Beautiful circulation pattern and very concentrated. And it is now east of Viet Nam and again between Viet Nam and the Island of Luzon.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy.
|SC|And I1d be very curious to know tomorrow morning if you people are carrying that one on their progs or on their analysis chart.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Bob, you want me to erase something on page 1-43 and insert something else.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack. On 143 under column A down at line 11 and 12 and 13, just to make sure you have the right spot the line 11 0 data is 00115, you copy that, do you see that?
|SC|I'mwithyou.
|CAPCOM|Okay, change that line to 00377.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Change line 12 to 00050.
|SC|Go ahead.

|CAPCOM|And line 13, 00523. Over.
|SC|Okay, got that and, as you might imagine, when I said erase, I did. And you have the 04 and the 05 again please. That is, if they're pertinent.
|CAPCOM|Stand by, Jack, I'm lost here myself for a s e con d.

|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy, Jack. Just a reminder to be sure and configure the COMM per the presleep checklist and just for your information, Jack, I hold you at 100 116 miles. I was going to give you a call at a 100 000 even then I got talking to you so you crossed the 100 000 mark right now.
|CAPCOM|Tomorrow you're probably not going to be giving us our weather report - you'11 be too far out but we'll probably be starting to hear from the Moon, huh?
|SC|We're not going to see much of the Moon, you know. It's going to be pretty dark so I'll have to keep looking at the Earth.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Pretty good - pretty interesting place. Very interesting place.
|CAPCOM|I'm real sure.
|SC|And I guess maybe I - 100 000 miles - my goodness gracious. That's impressive.
|CAPCOM|Yes sir. You're slowing down all the way, J ack .
|SC|Yeah, it's sure downhill all the way back, isn't it?
|CAPCOM|That's for sure. Jack, did the CMP get off the line and is he sacked out too.
|SC|Yeah, I lost both those guys. They decided they wanted to sleep and I may be rumbling around here for awhile but I took - we all three took Seconds so I think we'll get to sleep before long.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Just give us a call if you need anything and we'll be watching everything and pleasant dreams.
|SC|Now you don't really mean that, do you?
|CAPCOM|Well, I can't come up and tuck you in so - Hope you have a good sleep, you need lots of rest up there, gang.
|SC|I'll tell you, Bob, about half way through this day I think I acclimated and I really feel good. I've been eating a lot better and I'm not - the only thing I ever really felt was a slight headache. It really - not the fullness of the head that people describe, I guess, but just a little headache. I could have been looking at the Earth too much, I don't kn ow .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 24:42 CST 0016 MC 142/2
024:42:00|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, you've been sounding good.
|SC|Oh, actually, I've been feeling fine. Just - none of us have felt like eating and that's probably normal and everybody's eating more now and we'll start to sleep at night.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Jack, just a reminder on that time for the presleep checklist. It's important to us because we can get high bit rate data more.
|SC|Bob, we cut out right in the comm sleep configuration now - working that way.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Ed Grindell was shaking his head one minute - now says as long as you're working that way.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 24:48 CST 0022 MC 143/1
024:48:00|SC|Bob, you're still cutting out. Try it again.
|CAPCOM|No - no problems, Jack. Just a reminder on the COMM, that1 s all. We 1 re watching you go through the checklist here.
|SC|Okay. I'm on high gain now and OMNI Bravo selected. How do you read, Bob, on the high gain?
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Okay. And it's in REACQ 10 zero.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. Stand by on that, Jack. Okay, Jack, can we refer you to the checklist on Sl-27, a sleep configuration there where your S-band squelch enabled, etc.
|SC|Roger, I'm enabled. Oh, etcetera, yes.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, I'll get you that in a minute, Bob. Who knows, I might have something else to say.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Bob, I just probably ought to qualify all those remarks about the Earth's weather. It's purely a novice talking about something he is very unfamiliar with, except for having a longstanding interest in it, and I think the one philosophical point, if any, that comes out of it is that somebody, probably three and a half billion years ago or so, could have looked at the Earth and described patterns not too dissimilar. And, it was within those patterns that life developed, and now you see, I think, and obvious to everybody, what that life has progressed to doing, and I certainly think that all of us feel it has not stopped doing that progression, and we'll probably see it doing things that even you and I can't imagine them doing. I certainly hope so.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, we concur.
|SC|Bob, you always wish that you had a poet aboard one of these missions so he could describe things that we're seeing and looking at and feeling in terms that might -might transmit at least a part of that feeling to everybody in the World. Unfortunately, that's not the case, but he - he certainly couldn't look at that fragile blue globe and not think about the ancient sails of life that are crossing its path and wonder ahead to the - up to the present, to the modern sails of life that are represented by men that developed out of that life that are sitting there next to you and that are the country in all sorts of different guises and working towards the same end and that is to put that life farther into the Universe. I certainly hope that some day in the not too distant future, the guy can fly who can express these things.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 24:48 CST 0022 MC 143/2
024:48:00|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, you're doing a pretty good job expressing them. Jack, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Alright, Jack, we'd like to go to select OMNI Bravo and stow the high gain in the normal stowage. It is customary we'do not use the high gain for PTC going TLC.
|SC|Okay, Bob, I'm sorry but the checklist indicated that you do all go back to OMNI Bravo.
|CAPCOM|Rog. It's probably ambiguous if you end up going on the checklist up to the top of 128, it shows you where you want OMNI Bravo.
|SC|Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it.
|CAPCOM|Say again, Jack.
|SC|Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it.
|CAPCOM|Rog* I concur. I should have probably called you earlier and just pointed out on the flight plan where It says presleep checklist and then there's the word COMM and it says OMNI and that leads you into the checklist and makes sure you use the OMNI setup for the sleep configuration .
|SC|Ho, ho, ho. Tricky fellows. I guess you're right.
|CAPCOM|Yes, normally we'don't SIM PTCs, TLCs, and TECs very often, that's for sure.
|SC|Well, that's because we have a whole day to learn out here.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.

Flight Director, Pete Frank, and his orange team of flight controllers will hand over Mission Control duties to Jerry Griffin's gold team of flight controllers in about 15 minutes at 7 A.M. central standard time. Each of the departing controllers is now briefing his relief. There will be no change of shift news conference. The orange team will double back after 1 shift, returning to the Control Center at 5 P.M. today to get back on a schedule which will put them on the EVA shift. To summarize the shift now ending, the crew began rest period at 25 hours elapsed time. Each crewman took a sleeping pill and Jack Schmitt reported that Gene Cernan and Ron Evans were asleep shortly after the crew configured the spacecraft for their rest period. However, Jack Schmitt, who was the duty man to wear the head set and the bio-medical harness during this rest period, seemed almost reluctant to surrender his view of the earth to sleep. At 100 000 nautical miles from the Earth he broadcast a weather forecast, then indulged in a bit of philosophy as he gazed from his window, about mankind's achievements. He remarked that from his vantage point the Earth probably looks the same now as it did at the dawn of man. Apollo 17 reached the halfway point to the Moon at an elapsed time of 30 hours 3 minutes. At that time it was 114 787 nautical miles from both the Earth and the Moon.

And a relatively busy day ahead with midcourse correction, - midcourse correction maneuver #2 at 35:30 ground elapsed time, a 10-1/2—foot per second posigrade maneuver which will raise the trajectory slightly from an impact trajectory with a minus pericynthion at the Moon, raise it to about 60 nautical miles above the surface. Latest numbers on the S-IVB impact predictions is for impact to take place at the ground elapsed time of 865823 at 6.7 degrees south latitude by 9.7 degrees west longitude. The gold team of flight controllers have settled in for a 10-hour day here in Mission Control, which in addition to the midcourse correction burn, includes the first manning of the lunar module, first checkout, which begins at about 40 hours. They start actually, at 39:30 getting the probe and drogue removed from the tunnel, going into the lunar module. We'll come back up live with the air-ground when the first call is made to the crew by the spacecraft communicator. And at 32:29, this is Apollo Control.

032:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 32 hours 58 minutes ground elapsed time into the Mission of Apollo 17, Almost 2 minutes remaining until the first wakeup call is made to the Crew of Apollo 17 by spacecraft communicator Robert Parker. Parker is joined this morning by Apollo 17 backup Commander John Young at the CAPCOM console, and it appears that Parker's releif CAPCOM Gordo Fullerton, just walked in the door and likely will relieve Parker in the day's duties of getting off midcourse correction if2 burn and the first housekeeping venture into the lunar module. Apollo 17 is now 122 186 nautical miles out from the Earth, velocity now 4259 feet per second. We'll stand by with the circuit open for the first wakeup call the usual post-sleep checklist, and flight plan updates and all of the conversation that normally takes place when the crew first wakes up. Let's just open the line now.
|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning.
|SC|Is that the best you can do?
|CAPCOM|That's not very good either. Give us a call when you want to talk to us.
|SC|Good morning to you.
|SC|How's everything look, Bob?
|CAPCOM|You guys look absolutely super, there's no p rob 1 era at all.
|SC|Nice way to wakeup. Maybe we'll get to sleep in for a few more hours.
|CAPCOM|Standby. I'll check on that.
|SC|(Laughter)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 08:40 CST 33:08 GET MC153/1
033:08:00|SC|Bob, 17 how do you read?
|CAPCOM|17, this is Gordo, Bob just finished up his work day with1that last call, an d I'll be on n ow.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 09:00 CST 33:28 GET MC154/1
033:28:00|SC|Houston, 17. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Good morning Gordy. How are you doing?
|CAPCOM|Real good. How about you?
|SC|We all feel pretty good this morning. Got some reports for you.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Ready to copy.
|SC|Okay, on this CDR; PRD is 17025. 6 1/2 hours good sleep. One seconal, which is the one I reported last night. So that's just one now. I had a — yesterday, mid-day or so - he had a nausea pill for gas. And we hadn't found the other gas pill so he tried that one and he drank, since I last reported, two and a half containers of water.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|CDR food intake, as with all of us, is 3. little bit r an dom an d X don't kn ow exactly the best w ay to report it unless you want it all in detail.
|CAPCOM|Let me check while you - go on and I'll see if they want a detailed description of his food or not.
|SC|Okay, LMP medical. PRD 24036. 5 1/2 to 6 hours good sleep one intermittant. Again I had a seconal but that's the same seconal I mentioned last night. And since last report - I guess 1 and - 2 and a half containers of fluid. (Garble)
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And just for checking on the water intake, you should have me down for 6 containers of water.
|CAPCOM|Roger. 6 total.
|SC|That's affirmed.
|SC|CMP Medical. PRD is 15023. 7 1/2 hours very good sleep. He had the s aine seconal we had and since last report has 3 water containers for a total of 6 now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Jack, I guess we'do want an accounting of all the food. Whatever you think is the best way to repo r t it.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. Back on the CDR and I'll just tell you what we ate. For the day 2. CDR mixed fruit at the can, instant breakfast, one vitamin pill; a bag of tea; Turkey and gravy; the wet pack; and orange juice.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay the LMP . Cinnamon toast bread, mixed fruit, inst an t b reak fast, coffee, lemonade, peach ambrosia, 1 vitamin, 1 slice of bread, grapefruit drink, gingerbread, orange drink, and I have one complaint. Somebody slighted me on a carmel candy and in meal C.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 09:00 CST 33:28 GET MC154/2
033:28:00|CAPCOM|Rog.
|CAPCOM|We'll stand an investigation.
|SC|Yes, it was not there.
|SC|Okay, CMP, The spiced oat cereal, mixed fruit, instant breakfast, and coffee, potato soup and peach ambrosia. That's all for breakfast. And then later on he had chocolate pudding and a grape drink. And let's see -we are - you might log him for a vitamin pill and me for a vi t amin pill1'
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Oh, yes, I forgot. It's here, 1 frankfurter for 1 un ch .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And we just changed LiOH canister as for the flight -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 09:10 CST 33:38 GET MC 155/1
033:38:00|SC|- in the Li OH cannister as per the Flight P lan .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And in a minute I'll have the weather report for you.
|CAPCOM|Very well.
|SC|Gordon.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Gordy, the null bias check plus .9 and 100 sec- on ds .
|CAPCOM|Okay, one question that G&C had, do you do that null bias at plus 100 or minus 100 on the MS scanner?
|SC|Plus 100.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and then it increased up to 101.9, right ?
|SC|No, it increased to 100.9.
|CAPCOM|Roger, miscopied you .9 okay, thank you.
|SC|Yeah - okay.
|SC|Seems to me like last night it was 100.7.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|And for our part of the post-sleep check list, I have the consumable status, if you'd care to listen.
|SC|Stand by, Gordy.
|SC|Gordy, we'll take your consumables in a second, let me bring you up to date on the weather around the world, if you're interested.
|CAPCOM|Yes we are, go ahead.
|SC|Africa, looks in pretty good shape, there is a- except for an area probably around Zambia and Rhodesia in the tropical convergence zone there where it looks pretty cloudy and probably quite rainy. There's a very strong circulation pattern and presumably a storm just off the coast of northwest Africa, very spectacular spiral formation of clouds in a cyclone development. It looks like there are probably 2 fairly weak cyclones -southern hemisphere cyclones in the south Atlantic. One, southwest of the Cape of Good Hope and the other about due west of the Balkan Islands, maybe a little bit north of that. South America looks to be in quite good shape weather-wise, except possibly Uruguay and maybe northern Argentina which appear to have a - at least some fairly thick clouds there, although no strong circulation associated with this. (Noisy interference covers some transmission).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 9:20 GET 33:48 156/1
033:48:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We got all that up to Argentina, then the OMNI switch kind of cut you off.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we got at least the first part of your weather report from up through the clouds in Argentina and then the switch in OMNI's cut you out.
|SC|Okay, that was about it, Gordie, that's - talk to you some more later on It . I guess the main thing I need now are your consummables.
|CAPCOM|Okay, by the way, you were looking back from more than half way to the moon, you're about 125 000 out now. On the consummables, the RCS is running at 1.3 per cent over the flight plan line. On the 02, tanks 2 and 3 are right on the line and tank 1 is about 4 per cent below the line, but it's been there all the way since launch, that same bias on tank 1. On the hydrogen, tanks 1 and 3 are right on the line, tank 2 is about 3 percent above the line. All in all, you're looking real good consummable-wise.
|SC|Okay, that's hardly worth writing down I guess. That's the way we like to see it.
|CAPCOM|Same here.
|CAPCOM|The only other thing I have in the way of updates is a PIPA bias update. You can load it yourself or we can load it when we come up with the uplink prior to the burn - your choice, and then we'll have an update to the erasable load update and a supplement to correspond with that bias update.
|SC|Gordie, why don't you go ahead and load it yourself when you send up the vector.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I'll give you the update for the supplement. It's on 1-43 whenever it's convenient.
|SC|Okay, Jacks getting that out. I ran another PIPA bias at minus 100 and it confirmed the first one. It ended up at 99.2.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Go ahead with your update on 1-43, Gordie.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's in the load A, and the octal ID of 03, which now reads 77252, change that to 77655.
|SC|Did you copy, Gordie?
|CAPCOM|I didn't copy your readback, no.
|SC|Okay, 30603 and alpha 77655.
|CAPCOM|That's right.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 09:30 GET 33:59 MC-157/1
033:59:00|SC|Gordy, how do you read?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, for the reference on those figures, at least for the LMP, I think I'm probably putting 8 or 9 ounces of water in the citrus drinks and those kind of things rather than 7, which has probably upped my water intake some.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|SC|I think that probably goes for everybody. That probably goes - goes for Ron and probably Gene also.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 09:40 CST 34:09 GET MC158/1
034:09:00|CAPCOM|17, Houston, I have a little synopsis of the news here if you'd like to listen during breakfast, let me know.
|SC|Okay, mighty fine. Send it up.
|CAPCOM|Okay, front page first. In Paris Henry Kissinger met for 30 minutes this morning with French President Georges Pompidou at the Elysee Palace just hours before his scheduled conference with North Vietnamese Polit Bureau member Le Due Tho. North Vietnamese spokesman accused Kissinger of attempting to force a peace settlement by threatening further escalation of the war. As both U.S. and North Vietnamese negotiators expressed disappointment at the continued deadlock, Chief American delegate William J. Porter traveled to Brussels to brief Secretary of State William B. Rogers. Rogers will return later today from the NATO Conference of Ministers. This one is datelined Brussels. Diplomatic sources indicated today that NATO allies will request negotiation with the Soviet Union and its allies on mutual troop reductions in central Europe. Exploratory talks is expected to begin by January 31, with full scale negotiations to follow sometime next fall. In Kansas City, vital life signs for Harry S. Truman appeared to have stabilized. But the 88 year old former President remains on the critical list at Kansas City's Research Hospital. Truman is suffering from lung congestion and heart weakness. In Argentina, aids to popular Argentina politician Juan Peron said that Peron will refuse the nomination to the presidency of Argentina, and will return to exile during the coming week. And on the sports page, Rice coach A1 Conover is expected to reveal sometime today his decision to either remain at Rice as head coach or move to his alma mater Wake Forest in a similar position. The Owl head coach has said that he has been offered the job and promises a "yes" or "no" decision today. There is some speculation that head coach Joe Patemo of Penn State may move to a head coaching job in the Pros next year. Paterno is busy preparing his Nittnay Lions for a Sugar Bowl meeting with Oklahoma and is refusing to discuss the matter until after the game. Locally, the state high school football playouts -
|SC|(garble)
|CAPCOM|Say again?
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, continuing after being rudely interrupted by the omni switch, the state high school football playoffs here in Texas are underway and with a whole host of games scheduled this weekend. And the final item, the major league baseball players association and the commissioners office are going at it again. It must be getting close to spring training t i me .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 09:40 CST 34:09 GET MC158/2
034:09:00|SC|Gordie, you cut out at just the Nittnay Lions.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Did you hear about the high school playof fs ?
|SC|No, the last we heard was the Nittnay Li on s .
|CAPCOM|Okay, Paterno, the head coach at Penn State may move to a head coaching job in the Pros next year. He's busy setting up his Nittnay Lions for a Sugar Bowl meeting with Oklahoma, and is refusing to discuss the matter until after the game. Here locally, the state high school football players are - playoffs are underway with a whole host of games scheduled for this weekend.

|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. A reminder we need the H2 purge line heaters on now. And I do have a maneuver pad for the midcourse when you're ready to copy. Over.
|SC|Okay. I've already got the heater on and give me about 5 minutes and I'll get the pad.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And if you'll give us ACCEPT and POO we'll get the uplink started just after the next antenna switch. We want to catch it between switches.

034:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control 34 hours, 58 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 17 spacecraft, should at this time be coming out of the passive thermal-control mode and getting into the proper attitude for the midcourse correction burn P2, which is some 31 minutes and 23 seconds from now. Apollo 17 presently 126 988 miles from the Earth traveling at velocity of 4098 feet per second. The midcourse correction burn #2 with an ignition time 35:29:59.1 has a velocity change in the posigrade direction of 10.6 feet per second, which for the service propulsion system engine is a BURP lasting 1.58 seconds. Purpose of this burn is to raise the pericynthion from an impact trajectory as it stands now, to one with a clearance over the Moon of some 53 nautical miles which will become the pericynthion of Lunar Orbit. Standing by on air-ground 1 at 34:59 this is Apollo Control.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, there's all balls and 05 on th at P 5 2 .

|CAPCOM|Okay, it's a pretty slow process.
|SC|Okay, Gordie, battery A is being charged.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|And I checked that seven alpha in the vent position and it's1.6 also.
|CAPCOM|Okay.

|CAPCOM|Let me take a check to my left here.
|SC|I'll take a deep breath for you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Your ZPN looks good.
|SC|Okay, I don't have the other one on yet, but was a little bit curious because I left the electrodes in this thing, and - you know the little sponges, I left those inside the electrodes, but they stuck to the back of the electrodes and kind of corroded the inside of it a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Evidently it's working okay.
|SC|Okay, mighty fine.
|SC|Put some new ones in. APOLLO 16 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8772 CST 11:30 GET 35:57 168/1 (Dead Air) -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 11:40 CST 36:09 GET MC169/1
|SC|Okay, Houston, is my heart beating?
|CAPCOM|I'm sure it is, Ron, but I'll check to my left.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|We'll wait a couple of minutes, it takes that long to settle down and give you a reading on it.
|SC|Okay. No problem.
|CAPCOM|Ron, your EKG looks real good.
|SC|Okay. Thank you much.
|SC|That's all new, we call it those punches and stuff, you know.
|SC|And, Houston, I'm not putting any cover tape on it, so if it quits - you know, comes loose or something like that, well let me know and I'll push it on again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, will do.
|SC|You might make a note that Dr. Evans was assisted in that operation by Dr. Schmitt.
|CAPCOM|Roger, doctor.
|CAPCOM|Jack, I've still got this flyby pad standing by .
|SC|Nag, nag, nag.
|SC|Can't talk with a mouthful of bread cubes, it all comes out.
|SC|Okay, what kind of pad you want to give me? Flyby, right?
|CAPCOM|Right. A regular maneuver pad.
|SC|Okay, and I guess the other one I can cross out, ri ght ?
|CAPCOM|That's something that's obsolete now that you've done micourse 2.

036:20:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours, 34 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 17, 137 714 nautical miles out from Earth, velocity now, 3985 feet per second, continuing to decelerate as we approach the so-called cross over between the sphere of influence from Earth to Moon. I can't recall ever seeing two pages of a flight plan as blank as these are, from 36 hours to 38 hours. Later on today, the, — after the eat—period the crew will crawl through the hatch into the Lunar Module for housekeeping chores checking out of stowage of equipment in the Lunar Module. But, the most exciting thing going on now, was the checkout of Bio—medical harness on the Command Module Pilot, Midcourse cor— rection burn went nominally on time. The velocity just at time of ignition was 4058 feet per second. It jumped approximately 10 feet since there was a 10-foot per second burn. But then, within a few minutes it was down below the original velocity as the spacecraft continues to decelarate. Altitude at the time of the burn or distance from Earth was 12 8 217. We show a pericynthion of 52.09 miles at closest approach after the burn. And standing by at 36:36, this is Apollo Control.
|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston. In about an hour or you might check the LM Command Module Delta-P again.
|SC|Thank you, we'll do that. It's 2.2 Gordo, I put it back in vent.
|CAPCOM|Okay.

036:59:00|SC|Hello Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America. Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, Gordo. We're up to 2.5 on the tunnel and still venting.
|SC|Okay, is that music we hear in the back ground.
|SC|Yes sir. (music) They've been making fun of some of my music.
|CAPCOM|Hey, it's coming down good, better than stereo.
|SC|Reminiscent of yester year, (music).
|SC|Music from America.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Thank you for the concert. That's very appropriate.
|SC|Gordo. Ron went off the air for a minute and LM Delta P is now 2.6.
|CAPCOM|Okay Gene.
|CAPCOM|Gene-o, we would like for you to let it get up to 2.8 before closing off the vent.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, we'll make it 2.8.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. That was a slight handover, the reason we lost signal for a second, there.
|SC|Okay .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 13:00 GET 37:28 MC-173/1
037:28:00|SC|Houston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|We're going to have a pretty good view of the Earth out of any CSM windows at the LM checkout altitude?
|CAPCOM|I'll check on that.
|SC|We're sort of blocked right now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, we're predicting that your LM CM Delta-P ought to be about right now, about 2.8.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|We would like a reading - -
|SC|We'll check it.
|SC|Gordo, 2.9.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Sounds good.
|SC|Gordy, the reason I asked about that view of the earth, we were sort of thinking maybe we might go early if it was all right with you, and watch the Earth a little bit more .
|CAPCOM|Okay. We're still trying to get the answer on whether you have a window, standby, I might have it here.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the (garble) LM inspection attitude that you'll go to results in kindly a marginal view of the earth out of window 1, about 60 degrees away from it, boresite line of site. And we're- - we can - we've started to work on it and if you want to do it you can go to kind of intermediate attitude, which will be the LM attitude except for roll which will be off by about 60 degrees, which we'll give you a good view of the Earth out of window 1 and then when we get ready to do the LM entry, you can roll additional 60 degrees to get to the proper attitude. If you wish, your choice, o ve r.
|SC|Yeah, if that doesn't bother anybody down there we'd like to do that.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'll have something for you here in a few minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, if you're ready to copy of a VERB 49 maneuver for you,1that will let you look at the Earth.
|SC|Wait a minute Gordo, I'll just let you load it as we go here.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|SC|Okay, ready to copy.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Roll at 240, Pitch is 0 89 , and Yaw 0. And the high-gain1for that attitude, we think it'll probably track to this attitude,1Is plus 29 and 27.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 37:58 GET 13:30 CST MC 174/1
037:58:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston until you get the attitude OMNI Charlie will probably work better.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, we got your OMNI Charlie now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Locked on,
|SC|Gordy, for your information we have our LM transfer items in the jettison bag ready to go over and we're pretty well squared away on the, all the command module stowage now with minor exceptions.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston we'd like you to go ahead and get on the high gain again since, stop it just wondering around aimlessly, and how does the Earth look now?
|SC|Sorry, Gordy to be so slow, Earth looks great! and we'll get the high gain up.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Houston, 17, are you reading?
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, going from South to North on Noon time, at least our Noon time weather, looks like there is a fairly strong mass of polar air moving from the Southwest up towards Tierra Del Fuego. It's mixed with some cloudiness that extends from that area all the way down to the Antartic ice shelf. But looks like some pretty good movment patterns from the southwest north northeast. No strong weather waves or cyclone development on that yet although one may be picking up about half way between Tierra Del Fuego and the coast of Antartica. The - where the front, or at least the cloud masses curve from an east west direction to an almost due south direction. Most of South America still looks like pretty good weather. There is cloudiness along the Andian Ridge and also in the Amazon Basin, stretching from the eastern coast of South America on up about, oh, two-thirds the way towards Central America. It doesn't look like frontal weather there. It's probably tropical convergence weather. Now there is this - still this small moderately developed cyclone pattern that's hanging pretty much over Buenos Aires now, I think, Uraguay and Buenos Aires. I think I mentioned that earlier in the day, and that still is there and I suspect those folks are getting a fair amount of weather out of it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Except for scattered clouds, Central America and Mexico for the most part are clear. As is most of the Caribbean Islands. Cuba and the others all look like they have pretty good weather. There's a little clouds off - cloud pattern off to the east of those Islands but doesn't look like any major weather in that area. The eastern half and midwest of the United States is completely cloud covered by now. There, however, the - extending from Mexico to Senora and up into Arizona and New Mexico and possibly as far north as Colorado, is a clear band; but then there is more cloudiness to the north of that. The Pacific regions west of - the west coast of the United States is cloudy at least west of Southern California. I can not see Baja, so that cloudiness extends down south of - into Baja, California. I see no strong new frontal patterns; although I'm looking right across the LM at the Earth now. There may be one that would be lying maybe across Northern California and into Colorado. With a little clear area ahead of it, possibly in Kansas, but then into this solid bank of clouds that stretches from Brownsville at least clear up to - along the Gulf Coast across the panhandle of Florida, up the East Coast into, on out Nova Scotia, I'm sure. Florida is clear. Florida, let's see, the peninsula portion of Florida, it looks very clear and some of the deep turquoise green water to the south and southeast of that area are very obvious at this time.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 37:25 CST 13:57 MC175/1
037:25:00|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. I'm following along on the satellite weather picture here that's taken from about your same vantage point, and although nowhere near the detail that you're describing.
|SC|Have you seen today's analysis charts of the United States or North America?
|CAPCOM|No I haven't. I just told Jack that the weather men and a lot of other people around here, too, are following your weather reports with great interest.
|SC|Yes. Does that me an they're ri gh t or wrong?
|CAPCOM|You've got the better view by far.
|SC|That doesn't prove much. Okay, Gordy, I'm, I suspect that that s a pretty healthy front. I don't know. Your weather must be cloudy and bad today. Is that right?
|CAPCOM|Yes. We've got about a half mile vis and drizly rain . Okay. Well, I suspect comparable weather extends all the way across the eastern United States. That looks like awful dense clouds, although there's no obvious frontal pattern. It just stretches from the Midwest to the East Coast. And, also, there's no good indication of stratification of those clouds, as if they'd be fairly thick up into the serious level.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Looks like Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Sonora probably has 1 band of high cirrus, but other than that, probably a beautiful day out in that area. There's some transverse cloud patterns over the Mississippi/Alabama area. Suggest maybe that the jet stream may be just north of that region. But otherwise, there's now good indication of jet stream position right now.
|CAPCOM|Rog,
|SC|Gordy, there is one minor weather disturbance, possibly just about over Puerto Rico or maybe just to the east of that island. No strong circulation patterns, although there's a hint of a cyclone development. Might be just a small depression in that area. I don't know whether your maps carrying anything down there or not .
|CAPCOM|I think I see what you're talking about on the satellite picture, but I don't have a service analysis that goes that far. I do, just now, got a copy of the services chart for the United States. And there's a front stretching from northern Texas northeastward up through Tennessee and Virginia, and another one sort of parallel to it. But, this way southward from Louisiana along the Gulf Coast across northern Florida and on out into the Atlantic, and I guess the two are kind of blending together to make that irregular mass of clouds you mentioned.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, if I'd been a little more observant I could see that there was a little bit, looks like a decrease in at least the thickness of the clouds, vertical thickness, between the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 37:25 CST 13:57 MC175/2
037:25:00|SC|two areas you just mentioned. So, there is some indication of those two fronts. Although, they are contributing to a general weather pattern in the eastern United States.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|I think with a little experience in this busi ness, you might have picked those two out of that mass, but it's not immediately obvious.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|You got anything on there coming in from the northwest now, say up in Wyoming or Colorado?
|CAPCOM|The way it's drawn on this surface charts shows that northern front that I mentioned just now, sort of curving on up through Central Colorado, and then bending westward toward, through Utah. That's about the only other frontal activity. There's one, probably dry front, then a short one through Central Arizona. And southern Utah.
|SC|Okay, well that makes sense. That would match with that what I was thinking was high cirrus in Arizona. And also I can see how you could bend, that's the northern front up through Colorado and then back westward to explain the patterns we're seeing in the clear areas south of that.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Gordy, the zero phase point now is off the coast of Chile and Equador, oh, maybe, 10 or 15 degrees of longitude, and it is fairly dull. It does not seem to indicate any great amount of choppiness or wave action in that area.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And about 15 minutes ago, Gordy, I took 2 more Hasselblad shots of the Earth.
|CAPCOM|Okay .
|SC|And also, Houston, frame number, let's see, that's 16 and 17 were taken of the Earth about 15 minutes ago, too. And it's magazine Sierra, Sierra.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we copy that.
|SC|Gordy, with respect to the ice pack off the coast of Antartica, it's difficult to distinguish pack ice from clouds, in general. However, the clouds seem to pick up reflection patterns with respect to the Sun, and using that and some shadows below as the criteria, it looks as though the pack ice in the South Atlantic would extend to a latitude almost comparable to that of Tierra Del Fuego. I don't know whether that, that's reasonable or not .
|CAPCOM|Okay, I don't either, but mayb e someone who's more of an expert can clear up your question on that. Ill let you know.
|SC|Yes, now to the southwest of Tierra Del Fuego there s a, looks like a small cyclone developing, clockwise rotation, just off the edge of the pack ice, and, but it does not seem to be closely associated with the frontal activity that I mentioned when I s t arte d.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 37:25 CST 13:57 MC175/3
037:25:00|SC|out speaking at this particular time.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|There is another one, maybe a front, a little bit ahead of that cyclone, that's now extending north-south, starts in the pack ice area and extends up, oh about halfway from there to Buenos Aires, in the direction of Buenos Aires.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 38:37 GET 14:10 CST MC-176/1
038:37:00|SC|Buenos Aires. It doesn't look like a very major mass of air, or frontal system. It may develop into something over the next couple days though.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And centered, Gordy, at about 45 south, and say 30 west, there is another cyclone area that's ahead of the last one I talked about. That doesn't look, I think I talked about it yesterday, still does not look too strong, although, the clouds as I recall, the cloud cover is somewhat more well developed and circulation patterns seem to be better developed. It may be an intensifying storm over what we saw yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I can not see that it is associated with any clear frontal activity however.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|That, I presume, should be migrating in the direction of the southeast coast of Africa, so we'll keep an eye on it.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|That reminds me, did you get any informa tion on the, that, what looked like a very strong concentrated typhoon or hurricane in the south Pacific between Borneo and the Philippines?
|CAPCOM|Let me check and see what we got on that. I wasn't here when you first talked about it evidently.
|SC|Well, it was one that they didn't seem to be carrying and it looked extremely well developed from h e re .
|SC|Gordy, yesterday that one, the one I'm speaking of was centered at about 15 north and 117 east.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I've been informed that the satellite people are carrying that one now. I'm not sure whether they had seen it before or until after you did. But they are aware of it now, and are tracking it.
|SC|Well, we're not competing. They just didn't have any information for me on it yesterday. We'll probably be able to see that again late this afternoon.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the one that you just gave the coordinates on, does have a name, Therese. Hurricane Therese. And, so the other one must be the, must not have a name.
|SC|Okay, now which one has - is Therese.
|CAPCOM|The one you just - the coordinates you gave almost exactly pinpointed Therese.
|SC|Okay, that's near the Philippines.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. Between there and Vie tn am.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 38:37 GET 14:10 CST MC-176/2
038:37:00|SC|Okay, well, then that sounds like that's an up to date position. It has relatively little movement since yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Rog. They show it moving just very slightly wes twa rd,
|SC|Okay. Are they carrying anything south of Guam now, that we talked about yesterday?
|CAPCOM|Ah, take a minute to get something on that. They don't have a current map showing anything in Guam right n ow .
|SC|And we also had a storm developing south of, or southwest of New Zealand. Might look at that one too.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Jack, are you making these observations through the monocular?
|SC|Ah, yes sir. Although most of them, well at this distance, Gordy,* the circulation, the detailed circulation patterns to say what is a cyclone and what isn't, are not visible to the naked eye. At least not to mine.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|The major frontal patterns are however.
|CAPCOM|Jack, that disturbance you mentioned near Guam isn't being carried on the current chart here as anything significant. They do show some cloudiness north of the tropical convergence zone, but, just that.
|SC|Okay, well, I had a feeling that what I was seeing yesterday might of just been the remnants of Therese, which I think went down into that area a couple days ago. It was not a very well developed system, but did seem to be isolated from the other cloudiness that I would of put into the tropical convergence zone. That was between Wake and the Kwaj aleins .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordy, let me try to give you a dis cription of something that is a little bit unusual than what we've been seeing. The, there's an axis that runs from, say the outer portion of the Ross Ice Shelf along the, and just off the coast of Antartica, then bends up so that it would pass just to the east of Tierra Del Fuego and then continues on that heading so that it would intersect the far east coast of South America if it continues. Now along that axis the, what appear to be multiple frontal patterns, or at least linear cloud bands, bend very sharply and change from a heading that roughly parallels the axis around the one that is roughly north-south. And some of the frontal direction changes that I gave you earlier, down in that area are also bent around that axis.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And there isn't, oh, there's probably a dozen if you tried to pull 'em out cloud band between the Ross Sea and Tierra Del Fuego that bend around the same axis.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 38:37 GET 14:10 CST MC-176/3
038:37:00|SC|Quite striking.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Now there's some indications to me at any rate, that the jet stream in that area may be essentially east-west, oh, maybe 20 degrees of latitude north of the Ross Sea and then bends down very sharply so that it intersects the, or approaches the Antarctic Ice Shelf to the east of the Ross Sea and then maybe it bends up and forms the axis I just described that is causing that bending of the cloud pattern.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Sounds like a good theory. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 14:25 GET 38:52 MC177/1
|SC|— there's a linear clear area in that area north of the Ross Sea that -- and to the north of that is a sharply defined front that I talked about earlier. And, then both -- that front continues, the clear area is cut off by the axis that I described, the cloud axis.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Now, that should show up real well on the 250 millimeter pictures we took —
|SC|Gordie, I'm back looking at zero phase, and now, apparently the exact zero phase was partially obscured by a cloud pattern earlier. Now, when I — there is a very, very small bright spot in the center of the zero phase area. Nothing comparable to what I described off the coast of Australia yesterday, but an extremely small spot. I suspect that the size of your bright spot in zero phase has some direct or indirect, at any rate, relationship to (garble).
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordie, as you might expect, the whole coastline of Chile or all of Chile, practically, is clear, beautifully exposed to us here, in particular the Atacama Desert, which is noted for that particular characteristic. And, at least among geologists it is. And, the coast of Peru is also clear with clouds following the Andean Ridge, probably the -- certainly the coast side of the Andean Ridge. Lima ought to be enjoying a very nice day today. The Ecuador, however, looks like it might have a little more cloudy weather, although it doesn't look like any major storm activity.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We have a couple of words here on medications. Is everyone listening?
|SC|Ye ah, we 1 re on, Gordo. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, you mentioned taking a nausea pill for some gas yesterday, and we were looking into some of the side effects. You definitely don't want to use that particular pill for gas. One of the side effects is that it is an appetite depressor, and there are some pills loaded in A7 along with the vitamin pills specifically for the purpose of eliminating gas. We would appreciate it if you'd give us a call in advance prior to taking any medication except the Seconal and aspirin. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordie, will do. I was aware that those gas-depressors were around. At the time, we couldn't find them in A7, and so I took one of those other things, whatever it is, and while you're talking about that, as per the preflight food check, gas is very evident, particularly on me, and I think I'm suppressing it slowly, but is there any problem, or what do you recommend on that Mylinol — or Mylicon, or whatever it is?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 14:25 GET 38:52 MC177/2
038:52:00|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by one.
|SC|It goes hand-in-hand with the amount of gas that I experienced preflight.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And it's the kind of gas — it's the kind of gas that just stays in your stomach.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, on the recommended use of those gas pills is to chew one after each meal, and then, if needed, chew up another one before going to sleep at night.
|SC|Okay, fine. I chewed one after breakfast.
|CAPCOM|Okay. A little water after you chew it up I guess helps its effectiveness.
|SC|That's a basic requirement, I believe. The effect of it has not been too obvious yet, though.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordie, do you want the 02 heaters 1 and 2 to AUTO now?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay. They're there.
|SC|Gordie?
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|I don't want to cause any concern on that gas. It's no real great problem. It's just a slight discomfort that's all.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene. I think we understand.
|SC|Gordie, I have just eaten my first peanut butter sandwich in orbit around the Earth.
|CAPCOM|Rog. How was it?
|SC|Wh at's that?
|SC|Well, it was just as good as it was when I was growing up. Which means it was great. I grew up on those things, as I recall.
|CAPCOM|Charlie Duke is here with me and he —
|SC|(Garble) sure have missed the lettuce and mayonnaise on mine, though.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 39:11 CST 14:44 MC178/1
039:11:00|SC|And Houston, we'll go ahead and maneuver onto the LM attitude.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're watching. Punch it in there.
|SC|Okay, directo 2 is coining open now.

|SC|Directo 2 is off.
|CAPCOM|Roger. America, before you open the equalization valve, we'd like one final reading on the LM CM Delta P.

|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Jack, Houston, we're ready to termi nate the charge on battery A.
|SC|Stand by. Good. CSM LM pressure equalization, huh? Okay, cryo pressure indicator to surge 3 and verify cryo. Wait a minute. See if I got the right one here. Recto 2 is on. Okay, Gordo, I cycled the cryo pressure indicator from, up to NOUN back to surge 3 and we got a master alarm, and there was no (garble) flow with it at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, I just did it again to verify it, and that picked up, it picked up the master alarm, although it might be associated with the fact that surge tank is down and coming back up.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. Although, the surge tank shouldn't have caused it.
|SC|Okay, let me give you one more try on it. Well, that time it didn't weigh it. All I did was go up to 1/2 and the alarm came on1.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, I went back to surge 3, it did not, so maybe it's coming on when I go up to 1/2.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Yes, there it is Gordy. It's definitely repeat able. I can go up to pressure cryo quantity 1/2 and the alarm comes on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene. I understand.
|SC|You might note that, Gordo, you might think about the fact that we were getting them when the cabin pressure was high after launch. There might be some association there, also.
|CAPCOM|Okay, a good observation,
|SC|Good. Switched the cabin selector to off. We got to unbolt (garble). Underneat the commander's couch. Okay. Repress package valve off, should be off. Okay, verify directo 2 is closed. Okay, temperment valve LM Command Module Delta P. Okay it's greater than 3.1, it's up around 3.6. Okay, we've got both the pressure equalization valves.

039:40:00|SC|Okay, Delta-P is two and a half and Gordie, battery H charge has been stopped and the battery compartment pressure is still reading .6.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Okay, that's a Delta-P 2 and closing equalization valve. Yes, we'll monitor for 3 mintues now.
|SC|You know, Houston, we just wanted to verify that no - none of the lights in the matrix were flashed when you operated that switching of the master alarm,
|SC|That's affirmative, Gordo none of the lights flashed at all.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|When we get the cabin pressure down Gordie, here we might try it one more time, which Gene just did.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and nothing happened?
|SC|That's affirm.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, still holding at 2.0 on the Delta P. Okay, we'll open the pressure equalization valve and when cabin pressure comes to 40 have to repress 02 SMG. Delta P is about .6 we might make it this time. Okay, I'm going to open her right up Delta P is .2 now.
|SC|Okay, Houston the hatch is open.
|CAPCOM|Roger.

Cernan and Evans at this time have gone into the Lunar Module, and they're going through the housekeeping transfer of items from the command module into the lunar module and will proceed with the checklist of activating the spacecraft, or lunar module, spacecraft communications system, and the communications have been split into two links on Earth, Air-to-Ground 1 for the command module, and Air-to-Ground 2 for the lunar module. They're on hot mikes of a voice-actuated circuit, so we can hear them run through the items as they accomplish them aboard the lunar module, Challenger. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 40:25 CST 16:00 MC182/1
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, a correction on the earlier statement, it is Cernan and Schmitt in the Lunar Module Challenger at this time. Evans had the detail of removing the probe and drogue earlier, but he's by his lonesome, back in the Command Module.
|SC|Am I not looking in the right place?
|SC|Let me look. I don't know where one is right off hand. I'll check here.
|SC|Well, just help me with some terms here. I was just looking again at sight of, underneath the power bungee. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 16:14 CST MC-183/1
|SC|Okay, Gordy, we're at the top of 1-13 and all switches, valves were in proper configuration.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you could have ask me and I could have told you that.
|SC|We were just trying to give you a plug, well, if you don't want 'em well, we'll take it back. (laughs) I shouldn't have said anything to the world's most experienced DLMP. Right?'
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|(garbled)
|CAPCOM|Ron, at first glance it doesn't look like you have one on board, (garble). We're still looking though, but I don't think we have one.
|SC|Well, it's was kind of the concision I came to when1I didn't find it in the system data - hey, I got a little bit to tell you about that, oh, those little ones underneath the power bungee.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|SC|Okay, if you look at the docking lights, number four up beside of that oh, kind of a (garble) looking thing. There is a snowman. In other words, a great big fat thing with a head on top of it. And if you consider the fat thing with the head on it as a snowman, well then the snowmans head, is pointing out a 9:00, on that one. Whereas one that's fully cocked and latched over there the snowman's head points up at about 11:00, And - okay, there is a lever that comes right out of the bottom of the power bungee it looks like, and then it comes out of the bottom then left out of that lever is another silver slot or silver bar that goes from the lever to the J hook with the snowman on it. That particular thing that connects the J hook to the lever coming out of the bottom of the bungee is visible. In other words it's not sticking back underneath the J hook. It's visible.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we've got just a line drawing here and we ve still haven't got with you on what's what according to the drawing. Maybe, you can hold off until we get a model of the latch then we can stay with your description.
|SC|Oh, okay, Gordie.
|CAPCOM|I'll give you a call.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|It's up to you. (Garble). I want to float up in the tunnel. Do you want to float up and look? You know the congestion I had all day yesterday is just about gone.
|SC|Gordie, you'll be happy to know that put ting the LMP s1camera together is 500 percent easier in zero gravity.

|SC|The regular type, huh?
|SC|Okay, Gordo, on the top of 1-15, we're ready to go ahead and transfer the power. We'll give you a call.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno.
|SC|Okay, the LM power circuit breaker is in. What the -- let me know what you want, okay? Okay, going to OFF, RESET. Okay, back on. And, I have to open my (garble) again. The pressure's been? I don't know what it is.
|SC|Okay, Houston, we got a good transfer.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Got it again by hitting the panel.
|CAPCOM|Ron, this is Houston.
|SC|Yeah, go ahead, Gor.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got considerable conversation going on here about that docking latch, and it's not at all settled yet. The primary thing we want to guard against is the possibility that it is malfunctioning and that we get it latched down on the ring and can't unlatch it, and, therefore, have problem with undocking, or possibly even prevent it. So, we'd like you steer clear of that until we come up with a final solution. No experimentation, please. Over.
|SC|Okay, I understand. I'll leave them alone. And, just one little other bit of information to let you know the handle itself is not free at this point to come on back down like it's -- you know. Like, if it were fully cocked, the handle itself would be free to come back down. It is not free, I did not try to put a whole lot of pressure on it, but it's not free.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I understand.
|SC|Okay, Houston. Glycol pump 2 is on, it's been on about a minute, and we've got good talk—backs from batteries 1 an d 4.

Okay, Jack you're cutting out on everything,, and all I'm getting is the end of your transmission there. Okay, I'm counting 1, 2, 3, 4. Jack you read me? Okay, you, you were unclear after your first two words in every case, just like you were cutting out on Bob. Got it all that time. You read me too? Well, that's interesting. Let me adjust the squelch on this one here .
|SC|Okay. They used to work. I can't hear the squelch on any of those.
|CAPCOM|Jack, (garble) your main transmitter and receiv er off and B transmitter (garble).
|SC|Okay, Gordy.

|SC|Okay, how do you read now?
|SC|Okay, I took it V to 2. It's the same kind of th ing I guess.
|SC|Okay, Houston, how do you ready Challenger? Counting 1, 2, ,3, 4, 5,. Over.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. They're loud and clear, although we have a lot of background noise. Not sure whether that's getting through. Do you know if Ron is still on (garble)?

|CAPCOM|Okay, and we'd like him to hold this configura tion right there, until we get things straightened out and we understand what the problem is.
|SC|Okay, understand hold configuration there. He just got about 2.2 on the signal strength.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene.
|SC|And tell them I head their transmission to you. Oh, a few minutes ago. I was at zero signal strength and I heard their transmission, (garble). One of them. The first time they acknowledged, that I was going to do it.

|CAPCOM|Hello Challenger, this is Houston. Do you read me?
|SC|Okay, Houston I read you. Your weak but clear signal strength is fluctuating. When you called me it fluctuated down to about 1.6. Over, and 2 now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack your loud and clear. The background noise I've been mentioning although I guess you haven't me mention it till now is what we expect in down voice (garble) and low bit rate. How have you read this transmission all the way through, over.
|SC|Did he say, say again. Gene, did he say say again. I got a little bit - oh he's got three point -
|SC|Their not talking to us this time.
|SC|What? Okay, Houston, I've got 3.4 on the signal strength and try me again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger your coming in loud an d clear how do you read me, over.
|SC|Okay, Houston, I know you tried to trans mit I could just barely tell that. I could see the signal strength vary down to three you were modulating appearently, but your not getting through to me.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger I'm transmitting symul now in both S-band frequencies and it sounds to us like for some reason when I transmit the uplink signal starts to break up. It's just the way you see it over.
|SC|Okay, Gordie you're breaking up there. Your still modulating but I cannot read you. Would you tell America what you said.
|SC|Yes, Gordie we read you in America loud and clear on that symul.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno.
|SC|Is he talking, Gene?
|SC|As soon as he starts trying to talk the signal strength drops off about 4 tenths.
|SC|I heard him loud and clear one time when he called you guys.
|CAPCOM|America and Challenger we're going to hand over to a different site and try that, (garble)
|SC|What else do we have to do, get some of these mags stowed?

|SC|Houston, do you read Challenger?
|CAPCOM|Roger, Challenger, read you weak but clear. How do you read?
|SC|Okay, Houston, you just came in loud and clear. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Okay, and that time you're loud and clear, Jack. Sounds real good.
|SC|Okay, Gordie, let me say once again, way back when we first started, and Gene was talking to you, I heard one of your answers, weak but clear, with 0 signal strength showing here. Now, that might have been through Ron's VOX, I don't know. Since then, you've been able to modulate the signal strength with occasional weak words, and then, that signal strength was up around 32 where it is now. Then, you came in loud and clear with a broadcast. I answered you, you said about three words then dropped off completely. And, then we changed configuration.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. That correlates with what we've seen here in the way of signal strengths dropping in and out. Stand by and I'll see where we want to go from here.

|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We're back with you after some site change, over. How do you read?
|SC|Okay, loud and clear. How me, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Real good, Ron. On that number four latch number four is the hook back away from the ring about one inch as opposed to resting against the ring. Do you have about an inch clearance on that hook right now?
|SC|Well, it's about a half inch.
|CAPCOM|Okay, understand about a half inch. And what position what the latch handle when the hook was first moved back, Ron, was it kind of like in a normal stroke back or was it just flopping back?
|SC|No, when I first looked at it the latch handle was - see the hook itself was over the ring when I first looked at it.
|CAPCOM|Rog, we understand that.
|SC|The hook was over the ring and the latch handle was flush you know it looks just like a normal hooked docking latch.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|SC|And, Bob, this is Gene. I can confirm that it did not fold back easily because I checked it yesterday. I checked to see if the hooks were over as well where the handles would fold back. But I obviously didn't check to see whether that one was seated. But the handle was locked.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand. And the first thing you saw was the depression in the bungee. Is that affirm?
|SC|Yes, that's affirm. And the bungee is depressed about three eights - three eights to a half of an in ch .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|You can push the - you can push the hook about an inch away from the ring, but the normal just a resting position on the thing is about a fingers width or a half an inch from the ring.
|CAPCOM|Roger, the hook is loose so it flops a little bit, you can move it back and forth. Is that affirm?
|SC|Yes, I can move it about a half an inch to an inch from the edge of the ring. Clearing the edge of the docking ring.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 17:54 GET 42:20 194/2
042:20:00|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron when you pull the hook - when you pull the handle back did you reach and pull the hook back with it or did it come back with the handle like a normal pull back then. .
|SC|No, the hook did not come back with the handle. The hook did not come back with the handle. Although when I pulled the handle back to - which is kind of a normally uncocked position. And then it wouldn't go any farhter you know it wouldn't go any farther. And then the latch itself or the hook or the J hook I'll call it the hook. I moved it off the docking ring back to this position which was about an inch or an half an inch from the docking ring. And it stays right there now. And I can't push it up into the docking ring at all. Can't push the hook back up to the docking ring at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, our plan here is to leave it like it is. We're going to think about it tonight and we'd like you to just leave it alone, okay?
|SC|Okay, sounds good. It'll clear the docking ring, no problem.
|SC|Houston, America. While Ron is putting in the probe and getting the hatch back in I'm going to go ahead and maneuver. How does that sound?
|CAPCOM|That's real fine, Gene.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 42 hours 27 minutes ground elapsed time. We're estimating the change of shift press conference in 15 minutes, 15 minutes at 6:15 central time in the small briefing room. Spacecraft communicator now is Bob OvermeyeT. During this past checkout of the lunar module. We've had considerable difficulty in some of the communications configurations in the way the down links and the uplinks were set up. And some bit of difficulty in sorting out just what the nature of the problem with one of the docking is. People will be examining this through the night and during the checkout of the LM tomorrow or additional work in the LM perhaps the thing can be sorted out. Apollo 17 presently at 143 562 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a velocity of 3 590 feet per second. At 4228 and standing by this is Apollo control.
|SC|Bob, are you all going to want OMNI or high gain on this.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. We're all locked on the high gain we'd just like you to leave it on high gain. The angles you see in the flight plan are in case it breaks lock. That's what you need with this attitude.
|SC|Okay .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 18:04 GET 42:30 MC195/1
042:30:00|SC|Okay, Houston. The probe is installed, we'll get the hatch (garble).
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|I'm not going to connect the umbillcals1, unless you really want to look at probe temperature.
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that, Ron.
|CAPCOM|We concur on that, Ron.
|SC|Okay, good.
|SC|Okay, Houston. The hatch went in nominally. Once the probe installation strut was stowed in the right position.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 42 hours 41 min utes. Apollo 17 now 144 002 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 3577 feet per second. The change-of- sh if t briefing is ready to start in the News Center briefing room. We'll take down this air-ground line and tape any communications during the course of the briefing and replay them at the conclusion of the news conference. This is Mission Control, Houston, at 42 hours 41 minutes.

043:20:00|PAO|Tbis is Apollo Control at 43 hours 16 min utes. Apollo 17 is 145 178 nautical miles from earth traveling at a speed of 3543 feet per second. The crew is now in the midst of the heat flow and convection demonstration. This is the demonstration designed to provide more exact data on the behavior of fluids in a low gravity field. This type of investigation is really not possible on Earth where gravity determines flow of fluids. In space the flow forces the surface tension. There are three test cells involved in this demonstration for measuring and observing the fluid flow, behavior and the results are recorded with the 16 mm camera aboard. We have about 5 minutes worth of tape that accumulated during the news conference and we'll play that for you now and then pickup live.
|CAPCOM|Testing, Houston. We are recommending QUADS Bravo and Delta for spin up.
|SC|Okay, Bravo and Delta. Thank you.
|SC|Okay, Houston. At 42 56 52.04. I started the stop watch and also the watch read 18 30 (garbled)
|SC|Okay, Houston. We started on ... we just (garbled) left the radio on linear, part of it. The little pie shaped things are changing color as we go out. The linear part of it all of the ships seemed to have been concentrated on the front edge of the glass and all pretty much in a linear direction or an XX direction. At this point in time I haven't seen any movement yet.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. Aren't they on the (garbled) same way they were on the backup unit the other evening in the wait Room on the LM?
|SC|Yeah, all those chips seem to be well, in the next, I got the lineal direction, the lineal part of experiment in the XX direction. And all the chips are lined up in that XX direction on the front or the top of the glass.
|CAPCOM|Roger. (garbled) they were in the backup unit the other day in the Wait Room.
|SC|Yeah, that's right.
|SC|Okay, Houston. We've started the cool down and (garbled) light five position there. The radio cells, they all started to change color except the one from about 10:00 to 12:00.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Except 10:00 to 12:00, got it. Did the lineal ball stay right in line there, Ron?
|SC|Yeah, the crystals or chips that are inside there didn't move at all. I just (garbled)
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|On the color patterns behind there, the one on the left, as you look at the unit, the color crystals only changed down to about nine-tenths of the first square as you come down from the top. The rest of them are all black on that particular, on the left row.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 43:20 GET 18:48 CST MC196/2
043:20:00|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|That's the maximum extent of. That's the max extent of the heating. You might check and see if the guys want to heat it a little bit longer the next time. When they do it in the PTC.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. We're copying everything you're saying and we've got all kinds of support here, in fact we've got one back up unit here watching what you're doing so we'll keep you posted on what we think.
|SC|Oh , ok ay .
|SC|Is the back up CMP operating it?
|CAPCOM|Matter of fact that's affirmed.
|SC|That's the way to do things.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, we'd like you to stay nominal on the eating time due to the film in the case.
|SC|Okay, will do.
|SC|Okay, Houston. Is there film in there to allow me to keep the camera running while I try to fill up that flow (garble).
|CAPCOM|Standby on that, Ron.
|CAPCOM|It's affirmative, Ron, you can leave it running.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Okay, Houston. The first thing I noticed as soon as I opened the flow four turns when it started running out a little bit, even without doing the inject. Okay, that's because the inject thing was open just a little bit. But it's alright.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we got it.
|SC|Okay, I'll try to squirt some fluid in there.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|With the fluid inject thing.
|SC|Okay, I'm taking it in quite slow. It's noted there are quite a few small bubbles coming out with it. So far so good. It hasn't overflowed the first capillary ring. And it's taken off and it's going by capillary action toward the bottom and toward the top.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|Okay, it finally met together. The part going around the top and around the bottom. Met together 180 degrees opposite of the inject port, and now is starting to go out across the middle and fill up from the inject port.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Lot of big bubbles coming out now. That's after about a turn and a half.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We got it.
|SC|Okay, that's two-turns now. The maniscus is still holding on the first inner ring, it looks like all the way around. At least as far as I can see. The bubbles, big bubbles have been coming out now, and also the fluid has taken over the right half of the bottom of the dish. It's starting to fill in a little bit, maybe a fourth of an inch circumference coining around from the left side opposite the in j e cte d port.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 43:20 GET 18:48 CST MC196/3
043:20:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, I'll keep going here. About two and a half turns now. And looks like all of the bubbles have already come out. We're getting real fluid coming out. Sure a pretty picture anyhow.
|CAPCOM|Roger. SC Okay, that's three turns. I don't believe we're going to be able to cover the entire bottom with the four turns. Okay, that's four turns---
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 18:59 GET 43:25 MC197/1
043:25:00|SC|Okay. That's four turns and It covered up the right, oh, three-fourths of the floor of the thing and about three-eighths of an inch on the left side of the floor. Three-eighths of an inch of the annulus all the way around, except for the right, oh, say right two-thirds of the floor.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And, you can use more than four turns if you need them.
|SC|Okay, let's go ahead and try to cover up the whole floor on the thing before we'do it — the bubbles are in there. I'm afraid they're going to stay unless they disappear when we eat it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It's coming out with no bubbles now. It looked like it almost formed a meniscus on top of itself. The top of where the bubbles were1.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. Are they continuing to spread out ?
|SC|Gas continues to spread out now, and with out pumping anything into it at all — I did that the last turn fairly fast -- it's spreading of its' own accord now, and it should go on over and cover up the bottom, I think. Once it completely covers up the bottom, I think we should go ahead and start the (garble) this battery. Okay. Now -- everything's all hooked together now. We filled up the bottom of the floor. Hey, for some reason, the bubbles seem to be starting to break now.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy that Ron.
|SC|Okay. I don't know if it's coincidence or what, but all the bubbles are formed together, especially in the center along the plus X axis direction and are about one inch wide and then they start about th re e-ei gh ths of an inch in from the circumference.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 43:27 CST 19:01 MC198/1
043:27:00|SC|Okay, I was going to try to break the bubbles with a pencil, but if you try to push a pencil into the bubble, it just moves aside. Yes, so that being the case, I am going to go ahead and start the, start the timer.
|CAPCOM|We concur on that, Ron.
|SC|That's called the old push a bubble with a pencil trick.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Just need a sharper pencil, Jack.
|PAO|Air-to-Ground is live now.
|SC|Or a thinner bubble. This is the best Friday afternoon matinee I've ever been to.
|CAPCOM|How about Friday evening, Jack?
|SC|Well, I've lost track.
|SC|Stand by, mark. That was 1 minute after the s tart.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I'll give another mark when I go to high on the, with the select switch. Mark it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Each bubble looks like it's locus of, it's looks like it's starting one of the (garble) cell.
|CAPCOM|Say that again, Ron.
|SC|Okay, each one of those bubbles looks like it's the locus, start of one of the Bernard cells.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|So far, the bubbles aren't breaking.
|CAPCOM|We copy that1i
|SC|Is Stu getting, did Stu get bubbles on his pattern, Bob?
|CAPCOM|We're not running it down here. We're just demonstrating on the demonstrator there, but Stu can tell you. STU1Roger, Jack. Yes. I, you're talking of the one that we'did, right?
|SC|That's right. Well I am now. I thought you were running it down there also. STU1No. Okay. The one that we'did in flight yes, I had a lot of bubbles, but I couldn't get mine, (garble) across the center. So, you all are already well ahead of what I did.
|SC|Gee, I'm sorry you had to admit that Stu. STU1Oh, you all just do such good work.
|SC|Another thing is, it seems to me like in 1G, the Bernard cells started completely back to the edge, you know, right back to the edge of the circle. And in this case, at least they haven't filled in yet, back to the edge of the circle, at all. They all started out in the center and are working around the bubbles and then just now starting to form a few of them where there aren't any bubbles.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 43:27 CST 19:01 MC198/2
043:27:00|CAPCOM|How large are the cells Ron?
|SC|Well, they vary considerably in size. I can see one that's about half an inch across, and then the other ones, they've got a great big bubble in it and yet the cell itself is maybe down to an eighth of an inch. The bigger ones seem to be on the outside and, of course, there are very few bubbles on the outside also.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And the bigger ones, generally right now, are averaging about, oh a fourth, to three eighths of an inch across the cross section (garble).
|PAO|This is Apollo Control.
|SC|The cells tend to be somewhat polygonal. Let's see, we've been going 6 minutes, 4 minutes into the eating part of it and the cells are polygonal but they don't seem to be quite as straight lined as they were on the ground.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Copy.
|PAO|Stu Roosa, Apollo 17 back-up Command Module pilot is talking to the crew now from the CAPCOM console. Stew performed a demonstration similar to this on his Apollo 14 flight. That demonstration was not as sophisticated as the 17 test and the 17 demonstration is expected to provide more exact data on the fluid behaviour.
|SC|It almost looks like it's reached a steady state now. It's 9 minus 2, 7 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, I think the one thing I neglected to mention
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 19:10 GET 43:36 MC199/1
043:36:00|SC|Gee, I think the one thing I neglected to mention is that we essentially have a convex surface from the material, in other words, convex with the high part in the middle, and, of course, that's where the bubbles are, too, but I think you'd generally have that type of a surface anyhow. And, it hasn't broken the meniscus of the lower, or the thinnest ring.
|SC|We should have had some popcorn on our s towage list.
|CAPCOM|Ro ge r .
|SC|Okay, now as the Bernard's cells are start ing to form in that outer annulus, then went all the way around.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 19:19 GET 43:45 200/1
043:45:00|SC|Okay, we went back to light 4 now. And we never did get any real beliginal cells formed around the outer anulous . And even the cells that were formed on the thing. Seemed like the particle flow within the cells was very slow when you compare that with the way it was in 1 g.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|Okay, I'm trying to suck the stuff back in the entry tube there and it looks like part of it's coming in.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron, we copy that.
|SC|And the camera is down to about 50 per cent here, so I'm going to go ahead and turn it off now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. Ron, if I didn't tell you we concure with turning the DAC off there.
|SC|Okay, yes I got you. I'll turn it off. You know I just happen to think after I've already sucked part of those bubbles back in there. We've got enough fluid in there to pump it out the next time without sucking it back in there, don't we?
|CAPCOM|I'm sorry Ron, say that again.
|SC|Don't we have enough of the crytox fluid without sucking that back in there? May I can just wipe the crytox off with some kleenex and maybe there won't be any bubbles next time.
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by. Ron, I guess we under stand you've pulled some back in, but you haven't pulled any of the bubbles and if you pull any more in you're going to start the bubbles back in. Is that correct?
|SC|Yes, that's correct.
|CAPCOM|Okay, why don't you stand by here on that, then.
|SC|I'll see if I can push the bubbles out of the way here with something.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the consensus is, we would like to not pull the bubbles back in. Think you've got a good idea.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|It's the old keep the bubbles out of the cryt ox tri ck.
|SC|Okay, I'll see if I can do it.
|SC|I see your finally getting caught up in the humor of the thing there, Stu.
|CAPCOM|Oh, I've always been in good humor. It sure sounded like that babble did the trick, Ron.
|SC|Yes, I think it did to. It looks like it worked real well.

|SC|Roger.
|SC|And, are you ready for the trotting gourmets' report ?
|CAPCOM|Roger. Everybody's here with all ears.
|SC|Okay. The CDR today had scrambled eggs, and three bacon squares, and a can of peaches, and pineapple drink for breakfast. And, then later on in the day, he had peanut butter, jelly, and bread with a chocolate bar and some dried apricots. The LMP had scrambled eggs, four bacon squares, an orange drink and cocoa for breakfast. And, potato soup, two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and a cherry bar and an orange drink. And, that hero of the matinee, the matinee idol of Spaceship America, had scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, cinnamon toast, orange juice and cocoa for breakfast. That's how he keeps his form. And, for lunch, he had a peanut butter sandwich and a citrus beverage. And, that's it, since there's nobody else up here.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy that. We'd like you to stow the high-gain at this time and OMNI BRAVO.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we appreciate all your information, and we'd like to just pass on some recommendations here from the ground that we'd like you to keep on with your regular menu as much as possible, and if you do cut anything off, we'd like you to concentrate on eating the meats, the juices, and the fruitcake, which are the most effective for maintaining your electrolyte balance.
|SC|Okay, Bob. We understand what you're saying. We're shooting at eating it all. It's just a lot of food, that's all.
|CAPCOM|Rog. We understand, Gene. Also, on that group of foods, peanut butter's great for the electrolyte balance, also, so you're doing okay.
|SC|I knew it was good for something. It couldn't be that good without being good for something. I think we're all trying to make a concentrated effort also to keep quite a bit of water down.

|SC|Okay, got a Little information on what we were talking about yesterday with respect to southern Pacific weather if you've got nothing else going on.
|CAPCOM|Hello, speak to me.
|SC|Okay, looks like that little cyclonid circulation we had over New Zealand is still there and looks like the front it was associated with is broken up a little bit; however, that pattern seems to be hugging the New Zealand area and, but has not intensified. If not, it may have even weakened a little bit since yesterday, hard to be sure exactly. The front does not look as strong, and it still seems to be hanging, just stabilized, and with all of Australia clear now and the western edge of that front being just off shore north of Brisban. There is a, east of New Guinea, in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands, looks like a fairly moderate sized cyclone developing at the western edge of the front that was somewhat farther north and west then the one over New Zealand. North of that, Wake/Kwajalaine region, it was mentioned yesterday that the Aria people still seems to be in general overcast condition, but, the clouds do not look very heavy or impacted at all. New Guinea is just on the LM so, yeah, I think I lost it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I think we've got you now, accepting.
|SC|You're loud and clear, too.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Stu, I think we lost you about the time I lost view of the Earth and mentioned the Wake/Kwaj alaine area, right?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. we'didn't get much of the Kwajalaine report.
|SC|There was nothing new to add over yester day, just seems general cloudiness in the area but they do not look to intense are well organized. Just probably a general overcast.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|I'll try to get some exercise and then I'll be back at you with some more information. Maybe we can see the Philippines by then.

|SC|Okay, I think that big storm that Jack was referring to has moved off well to the east of Australia. Very definite counterclockwise rotation and then it stretches to the south or what might even be the southeast. And then just rolls right - we have a big frontal pattern and then rolls right into another clockwise rotating low down there near antartica. It gives me the impression of a parrots cone when he's got his features ruffled. And it in turn has another low trailing it arching and then flowing into another low that is very near the continent down there of antartica. They form a chain as I just described coming from - well possibly southeast of antartica. It's hard to really tell what east is down there on up to do west of Australia by several hundred miles.

|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Just wanted to get COMM there again we had some switch over there. You might be interested, we've got an ATS map in here from this morning. We can see the flow patterns in the antartica just about 120 degrees west which is a little closer to South America than what your calling I guess. we'do see that activity down there.
|SC|Okay, Bob and there is a very large cloudier mass between Australia and Antartica. It has a tendency to want to start a rotation and you can say ahead of that it's not too strong right now. We're seeing about three quarters of the Earth I guess . Judging from our clocks and what we can see it looks like the Sun is setting right over the west coast, and it leaves us with about three quarters of the Earth available to us.
|CAPCOM|Rog, it'll be about 6:15 Los Angelas time right now so it's probably sunset out there.

004:34:00|CAPCOM|Ron, just a reminder from the flight plan change last night you will have a P52 coming up here at 451hours in your flight plan.
|SC|Roger, mighty fine thank you.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 44 hours 43 minutes. That was a reminder that we are approaching the time where we are going to make the first step in a two step adjustment caused by the late launch. This will be to bring the Greenwich mean time, the ground elapsed time and the flight plan together. What this first step will account for an hour of 2 hours and 40 minutes adjustment that will be made eventually. The clocks will not be recycled at this time at 45 hours. The clock recycling will be accomplished later in the mission at 65 hours elapsed time. This 1 hour adjustment consists of moving the activities that were scheduled in the flight plan to take place between 46 hours and 30 minutes and 47 hours up to 45 hours in the flight plan. Therefore, during the hour from 45 hours to 46 hours we will have accomplished all the flight plan activities that were originally scheduled to be accomplished from 461to 47 hours. This will put us 1 hour ahead on the flight plan and we would pick up the activities originally scheduled at 47 hours at 46 hours under this plan. And this would proceed in an orderly fashion one hour ahead up to the 65 hour mark at which time we will synchronize the ground elapsed time clock to 67 hours and 40 minutes and at that time go to the 67:40 time in the flight plan and we will be back on schedule.

044:46:00|CAPCOM|Jack, just for information, you've got your heart rate to,103-
|CAPCOM|Jack, you've got your heart rate to about 103, and we lost data right now.
|CAPCOM|Jack, just for your information, the last heart rate we had was 103, and it's — we lost data right now, so 103 max we saw right now.
|SC|Okay, I was just doing some isometrics. Just tried running in place again then.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Do you want us to call you your heart rate if we get data in here now?
|SC|S ure.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're up to 115, Jack1.
|SC|(garble)
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 44 hours 58 minutes. Moving the GET clock ahead at 65 hours will affect the time that has previously been given for the lunar sphere of influence crossing. Newsmen who are interested in this time should add 2 hours and 40 minutes to the time previously given, which would make the time for lunar sphere crossing now 73 hours 23 minutes 24 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The distances and the velocities that were previously predicted will remain the same. Those are 190 725 nautical miles from Earth; 33 6 39 nautical miles from the Moon; and an Earth reference to velocity of 2340 feet per second. Apollo 17 is now 148 668 nautical miles from Earth —
|CAPCOM|-- resting, or did you quit?
|SC|No, I'm resting right now. Didn't seem like my arms have the stamina they did yesterday to hold the artificial G. (Garble)
|CAPCOM|We copied about a maximum of about 118 on your h eart rate.
|SC|What heart rate did --
|CAPCOM|About 118 max, Jack.
|SC|Roger, understand.
|CAPCOM|Don't let me harrass you. I just was kidding you on that. Whatever you think is fair.
|SC|You're not harrassing me. When my arm's rested, I'll try again.
|PAO|Spacecraft velocity now 3441 feet per second.
|CAPCOM|Couple of interesting data points raised, Jack. We saw — while you were doing that, we saw the PPC02 go up, and we saw the tanks destratify again the same way.
|SC|Very good. Next mission I' 11 have to flight p1an it.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|You saw the PC02 go up?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 20:20 GET 44:46 MC205/2
044:46:00|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. Let me get the numbers that you'd want1It took a jump from 1.3 to 2.4 on that.
|SC|Okay. That was with two of us going, and part of the time,1three of us going.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Now, we still got one going.
|CAPCOM|Well, it's not unexpected. Just thought you'd be interested.
|SC|Sounds sort of normal.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 45:01 CST 20:35 MC206/1
045:01:00|SC|Sounds sort of normal.
|SC|Hey, Bob, with this change in the hour, what time does penumbra start?
|CAPCOM|Say again the question, Jack. What time does what start?
|SC|With the change in hour, what time does the penumbra, what time do we enter the lunar penumbra.
|CAPCOM|Right now, we'don't, Tommy doesn't think we're going to go into the penumbra and we're verifying that.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Ron, could we ask a question about the heat flow experiment setup?
|SC|Go ahead. Sure go ahead.
|CAPCOM|You mentioned that the lineal chips were all on the in the X X plane, and we're just wondering do you mean along the X X axis of the spacecraft?
|SC|Yes. Along the X X axis of the spacecraft.
|CAPCOM|Is the long X X axis of the lineal cell along the X X axis, Ron?
|SC|Yes, that's affirmative. It's right side up, if you're looking at the connect panel, you know?
|CAPCOM|Yes. That's, they'd like so that the axis of that lineal cell would be parallel to the bottom of the panel 100, as an example. It's, right now, it's perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100, isn't it?
|SC|Now wait a minute. Yes, the lineal thing is right now perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 5 minutes. Ron Evans is making preparations to again perform the heatflow and and convection demonstration.
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|Okay, I think I see what you're saying. Sorry I read the thing with lineal cell in a plus X direction, but what they mean is lineal cell up.
|CAPCOM|Lineal word, I guess is the
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Okay, I'll turn around the other for this PTC part of it then.
|CAPCOM|Wait a minute on that, Ron. We're having a debate whether we want to maybe continue the next part the same attitude or just rotate it.
|SC|Okay. Seems to me you'd like to maybe leave it in the same attitude.
|CAPCOM|Ron, the only rational reason to change it right now is we're hearing word that if you had rotated to the other way, that you'd get better pictures on the DAC due to the lighting reflection on it. The PI would like to change it back
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 45:01 CST 20:35 MC206/2
045:01:00|CAPCOM|to the other way.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|17, just for information, we will not be going into the penumbra.
|SC|Okay. Sorry to hear that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 20:47 CST 45:14 GET MC207/1
045:14:00|CAPCOM|Ron, CU 52, and you can go ahead and torque,
|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston, we're watching your 52, would you go ahead and torque.
|SC|Okay, Houston, 17, thought you said go ahead and torque. Is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Ron.
|SC|We'll torque at 1630.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 17 minutes. Flight Dynamics Officer, Bill Boone, has just informed the Flight Director, Chuck Lewis, that 9 hours of tracking since the midcourse correction No. 2 burn, confirms the No. 2 burn was indeed a good one. On the present trajectory of the spacecraft the height, the closest approach to the Moon, is 52 miles.
|CAPCOM|Ron, a couple reminders, (garbled)
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Roger, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Oh, just a reminder on the LOI canister change, have you gotten into that?
|SC|We're not on that yet. We're, probably get started on this.
|CAPCOM|Okay. On the---
|SC|I'm on the heat flow first.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Understand.
|CAPCOM|We'd like to know when you start on that heat flow, Ron, because we need to get the DSC to high bit rate .
|SC|Okay, I'm having a little trouble getting them mounted to that. It's stable position this way.
|CAPCOM|Understand.
|SC|Okay, Houston, this is 17. Ready to start the heater in 45 seconds or let me know when you get the tape recorder for it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|CAPCOM|Tape recorder and high bit rate.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 21:04 GET 45:30 MC208/1
045:30:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we got the tape recorder in high-bit rate .
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Stand by one, Ron. We got a little change here we'd like to make on the plan on page 2-6.
|SC|Okay. Stand by for 0321, mark it. It's reset. Start the stop watch.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And, Ron, on the checklist on page 2-6 after the 16 minute end of test and proceed to next test, we'd like to turn the DAK off at that position.
|SC|Okay. Will do.
|CAPCOM|And, then, you turn it back on at the — where it says "Reset stop watch and start the time Zero there" point. Prior to that, turn it on. I'll remind you of it.
|SC|Okay. Do you want to fill that pan again, huh?
|CAPCOM|Say again, Ron.
|SC|Did you want to watch me fill the pan again?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Rog. Yeah, I'll be up before that whole watch has filled the pan. We just — while you're taking time wiping it and all that, that's when we -- we'don't want to use up the film there.
|SC|Okay. I'm with you. Actually, I've already cleaned out the little area there.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I've got one minute on my timer right now — about 1:27, actually.
|SC|Oh, thank you. Well, we'll start at two minutes.
|CAPCOM|You're still on the front page with the (garble).
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 38 minutes. Distance now 149 941 nautical miles from the Earth; velocity 3405 feet per second.
|SC|Okay, Ho us t on . The DAK is off now.
|CAPCOM|Roger. DAK off.
|CAPCOM|Say, Ron.
|SC|Go ahead, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Ron. If it's not too much bother, it's one of those nice things to have. The PI would like you to take a picture with the 35 millimeter indoor of the orientation of the heat flow as it mounted. See if you can get that, if it's not too much of a problem.
|SC|Okay. No problem. Good idea.
|CAPCOM|And, that should be magazine SS, which is the same one you used for the ALFMED tomorrow.
|SC|Affirmative, okay?
|SC|Okay. Looped the flow about four turns. A little bit is running out — one big bubble in it. And, I still have a little bit left over even though I wiped it out pretty good awhile ago. The meniscus is up to the bottom ring, and I -think we put in eight things in there where it's going to try to get the meniscus up to the top bazzle. Is that correct?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 21:04 GET 45:30 MC208/2
045:30:00|CAPCOM|That's correct, Ron.
|SC|There must have been a few more bubbles down in there again. That was two turns now, and I've got it about half full all the way across.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|But, maybe there's just about 8 or 10 bubbles in it1.
|SC|That's three turns. The fluid is exactly (garble). And, we're still going on the first fourth of the turn now, and we're still (garble) meniscus around the lower baffle -the smaller baffle.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 45:53 CST 21:26 MC209/1
045:53:00|SC|Okay, it looks like about 6 of the bubbles have developed into three for some reason.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It was doing real well, then on 7th turn a bunch of bubbles came in again.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Ron, I might have given you a bad call before. we'don't want the DAC on until just before that 2 minute mark here where just prior to going experiment heat select flow pattern low. At that point is where we want the DAC on.
|SC|Okay, you want the DAC on when it starts heating up .
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed.
|SC|Okay. You, know I may have lost track of the turns here, but I think we've got 7 and a half or 6 and a half turns in here. And it still hasn't overflown that first lower baffle. I've got a tremendous concave convex surface on the fluid, but it still hasn't broken the maniscus of the first baffle.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy that.
|SC|Okay, I'm going to go ahead and take it another turn, because it was my understanding, we wanted to try to get in the second baffle anyhow. So, I'm going to take another turn of crytox and put some more in there.
|CAPCOM|That's correct, Ron. Ron, if that doesn't do it, they're saying you might want to take a pencil or something and stir it a bit to try and break it up into lower baffle into the uppe r b af fle.
|SC|Okay, I'm afraid, may have it all over the place if I do that, but I'll try it.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Very slowly.
|SC|Right.
|CAPCOM|Ron, just a question here, while you're watching it here, do you have any bubbles in the lineal cell?
|SC|Yes. This one is going to be interesting. There are about a dozen, 9 to a dozen small bubbles right next to the inject board, and about the same number right In the center of the convex portion of it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. we'didn't copy your answer to the question about any bubbles in the lineal.
|SC|No, I didn't get to your question on that. In the lineal unit, there are no bubbles whatsoever.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Thank you.
|SC|There might have been very slight movement, as a matter of fact, I see just a very slight movement even now. The particles in there, they're still lined up in the Y Y direction, essentially. Although, it looks like some of them may have deviated from the front of the lineal unit back toward the center, toward the back of the lineal unit, as you call it. I missed your 2 minute
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8772 GET 45:53 CST 21:26 MC209/2
045:53:00|SC|start time there, but I can keep track of it here, so we'll start the DAC and I'll turn this to low at 245.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got a hac on it, Ron, if you started it, we started we started our clock.
|SC|Okay. You know, just for future reference, if we like to do things in OG and without jarring or jiggling, we want to make sure that the switch actuates with a minimum of pressure.
|CAPCOM|Roger, a good point.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 21:39 GET 46:04 210/1
046:04:00|SC|Okay, that's just now starting to develop looks like circular cells great big ones. And then some of the bigger ones are subdividing now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got that.
|SC|Some of them are even getting bigger one of them is about three quarters of an inch in diameter. And it hasn't divided yet at all.
|CAPCOM|Those are real good comments, Ron, I was just talking with the experimenters and if you've got nothing else to do giving us some sizes of those cells would certainly be very beneficial.
|SC|Okay. Okay, frame 2 7 was taken at an elapsed time of about four minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got that.
|SC|Stu, this is Jack I was taking the pic tures. I took four pictures about 20 seconds a part - the sequence just after he started it. And that ended with — or started with frame 26.
|CAPCOM|Okay frame 26 for 4 seconds - I mean 4 frames.
|SC|Okay, that one cell I spoke of that was about three quarters of an inch in diameter is now about an inch long and maybe three quarters of an inch wide. Each -all of the cells seem to be bigger in general. Their bigger this time two small ones at about an eighth of an inch and along along one side. The other one is a half inch oh a quarter of an inch, an half inch and then a circular when you get around to the annulus of the cup. Then you start getting circular slides instead of straight sides. All of the flow comes from the little center spot and flows outward from the center toward the outside of the cells.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|This happens to all of the bubbles that disappeared except two.
|CAPCOM|Ron, is the smaller cell you see about an eighth of an inch across.
|SC|The smallest cell I see is a four sided one that looks like a diamond. And it's an eighth of an inch on one side and an eighth of an inch on the other side and maybe three sixteenths on the other two sides.
|CAPCOM|Okay that sounds - that's a good descrip tion, Ron. I know on mine some of the smaller ones didn't show up in the film and we were not sure what size they are so you might before you quit bracket the smallest or the biggest cells by your estimate of the size.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 46 hours 10 minutes. Apollo 17 is 150 976 nautical miles from Earth
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 21:39 GET 46:04 210/2
046:04:00|PAO|traveling at a speed of 3 375 feet per s e con d .
|SC|And the information for (garble) experiment - the orientation was 90 degrees from us (laughter). Lineal cell was on the right and the lineal cenl was in line with the X axis.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we got, we had a drop in on signals right there and we'did get your last comment about the orientation. We missed some comment about the frame numbers, I think came from Jack.
|SC|Okay, somethings a little different on this one here. Right at the top of the low circle it looks just like a finger, it's a curved surface that goes out. It almost touches the, the circumference of the dish and it looks just like if you're holding your finger up and looking at it. It's that type of a shape to it. It comes back down and it's about a half inch wide, the flow again iminates from a source that is almost on the finger tip you might say.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 21:46 CST 46:13 GET MC211/1
046:13:00|SC|And Houston, did your listing or DSC if your listing? Had a little bit of felt loop, there's the end of film now. May as well stop it. Anyhow, I went to high for a little ways.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. As you came back in, I didn't get all of that. Understand you ran out of film and say, the unit.
|SC|Well, I still had a little bit of film when the cool down period was less so I went back to high on the flow pattern just to see what would happen. And it looked like they were starting with again larger size cells developing into smaller ones. And initially, all of the cells were about a half inch in diameter. And they were closer to the periphery of the dish then they were in the low position.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that, Ron.
|CAPCOM|After you went to high, after the 19 min utes, how long was it before you started seeing a change?
|SC|Ah, it was within a minute. See it cooled down pretty rapidly at the end of the 2 minutes, all of the cells had essentially dissolved. You had some radial lines on the outer perimeter of it, the cells were on the outer side, degraded into a strictly radial lines. Back to the second row of cells. The row of cells that were on the inside kinda joined together and all ended up into one or two large cells about an inch - about 3 - 3/4's of an inch across.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Sounds like real good data (garble)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 2200 GET 42:26 MC 212/1
042:26:00|SC|I still have it in high and the pattern that's developed is almost identical to the - what was happening in low, except it seems to be happening in a faster rate.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SC|Triangle or a little diamond developed down there and it disappeared. Only this time it kind of joined with a different little cell, but it was the same cell next to it. I still have the big one. It's about an inch long at 11 o'clock as I had before. I still have the finger it's developing about 12 o'clock and another one about 2 o'clock. And they seem to be migrating again toward the bottom of the dish.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, it sounds like you really wanted that experiment in great shape, and all the - and everybody's real happy that the - with the data, I guess now you might as well tear it down and press ahead. Okay, Ron, we're back with you now and everybody's real happy with the data and experiment and looks like you did a super job and you might as well tear it down and pressahead.
|SC|Okay. I still got it in high. And I'm kind of sucking the fluid back down the intake, and as I get the fluid thinned out, low and behold, there's a whole bunch of bubbles underneath there. And each bubble is a source for one of those little cells. It's the internal source.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We got that. You may have made a break through for science.
|SC|(Laughter) Okay.
|CAPCOM|17 Houston.
|SC|17 , go ahe ad.
|CAPCOM|Ron, just a reminder that we're scratching that page 3-45 that 46 to 47 that's scratched out and from then on all the times you just subtract an hour from it, if you haven't done that already.
|SC|Ah, let's see. Yeah, we've already done that, Bob, thank you.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Just a reminder on that and ECOM's over here trying to figure out if you changed the canister or not. Just a reminder on that one.
|SC|Okay. We'll get that as soon as I get this out of the way. Okay?
|CAPCOM|Sure. While you're back there panel 100 and that, you might part the optics, we see they're not in zero.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And on that same line, Ron, we'did noticc several times while people were watching through the optics that they went to zero, and it's no problem if the rates are low, but just a reminder that we'don't want bump them into the stops with any kind of a rate.
|SC|Yeah, I concur with that Bob. I guess I
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8172 CST 2200 GET 42:26 MC 212/2
042:26:00|SC|didn't realize we were doing that.
|CAPCOM|We just picked up som data points down here that people - you were all looking around, I guess and you might -it's easy to miss that trunion going to zero I guess.
|SC|Ho uston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack, Gene.
|SC|I'm ready to update your weather in the western Pacific if you're interested.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Go ahead.
|SC|Still can't quite figure out what that circulation around New Zealand means. It looks like it's merging with some more weather in the southeast. I suspect it's stormy there but I still it's not a terribly well developed storm although it seems to be broadening in its extent. Australia is completely free of any significant weather and almost completely clear and free of clouds. The - there appears to be a front - although right now it does not look too intense, approaching from the southwest, and it looks like it's about 5 degrees of longitude south of the southwestern tip of Australia. The typhoon gerous Mr. Reese I guess it is, appears to be just about the same position it was yesterday. And that is north of Borneo, and between Viet Nam and the Philippines.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We see that on the prog here, Jack.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 46:38 CST 22:13 MC 213/1
046:38:00|CAPCOM|Jack, we've been out of COMM here if we've missed any of your last report hereRon, did you ever get your P23 data from today?
|SC|That's negative, never did.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just got some updating information for you if you want to listen to it. I don't think you need to copy it down.
|SC|Very good, sir, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, the effective horizon was 25 plus or minus 6 nautical miles which is real fine. The sub-stellar pointing error was 1 arc minute plus minus arc minute which is less than the 1 Sigma error. The marking data was extremely consistent and all techniques and procedures were excellent. And the horizon updates from the current onboard value was 28 - is not required, so you're extremely good P23's Outstanding.
|SC|Okay, that's good to hear. Great. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|And I do have one imput from your other half. There's a concern that you spill grape juice on your flight suit it's hard to get out, so be sure and when you're eating - drinking grape juice you want to make sure you learn to drink it right.
|SC|Okay, we'll try that for sure.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 46 hours 46 minutes. The display which shows distance and velocity is referenced to the Moon at this time so these numbers I'm about to give you will be Moon referenced and not Earth referenced. Apollo 17 is 80 322 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 3 349 feet per second. The crew is in a meal period at this time and we'don't expect much conversation for some time. Earlier today, while the Lunar Module was being checked out and during a test of simultaneous dual communications capability from Challenger and America, a portion of the conversation was lost due to a communication line configuration in the Public Affairs distribution system. We have now obtained tape of this lost conversation from the Air/Ground recorders in the Control Center and will play that for you now.

|CAPCOM|Ron, this is Houston. We'd like to confirm the tunnel index angle - that's a positive plus 1.2, is that right ?
|SC|Standby, I don't believe it yet. I want to check it myself. Yeah, Gordo, that's what I ead but I figure it's his privilege.
|SC|I was checking for any scratches on the drogue but it doesn't look like there is any on there.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|See (garbled) - (humming - la de da etc)
|SC|Okay, Houston. The roll dockings index is on a 1.2 - a plus - 1. - a plus. 1.2.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Plus 1.2.
|SC|And - let's take a look up there in the docking latch number 4. The bungee is parallel - Roger -bungee is parallel but its not fully extended. You look down in the end of it and - you know - and its not fully extended. And - and the - capture - the docking latch itself or the docking lever is loose on the docking ring. So, its looks like to me that's when I ought to recock and fire it again.

|CAPCOM|Ron, can you estimate in inches how far down the bungee pistonis?
|SC|Yeah, its down about a half an inch.
|CAPCOM|Roger.

I took the hook and I pulled it back off the docking ring and then it caught again, so now it won't go back over the docking ring. Maybe - I just lifted the hook off the docking ring with my finger.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|(garbled).
|CAPCOM|Say, Ron, I would like to caution you1( again, sticking your finger around or under that hook - there1J may still be some spring energy stored up there that could i release.
|SC|Oh, you betcha. Yeah, I know that. No, I was just touching the top of the hook when I pulled it back off the docking ring.
|SC|I'll pulling back onto the docking ring and it looks like its back in the cocked position now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I think we've got the picture.
|SC|Do you want me to open the hatch here, Jack, or do you want to - while they're thinking about that I'll get out of the way and come on and open the hatch.
|SC|(laughter) Can't get up and can't get down. - Okay. -
|CAPCOM|We're having a long conversation about that latch Ron, why don't you all just press on down the checklist and leave it as it is, while we think about it?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 22:27 CST 46:50 GET MC-214/2
046:50:00|SC|Okay, that's what we're doing here, Gordo.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, do you want the 02 heaters 1 and 2 off and 3 auto? That's what you've got.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's fine.
|SC|Okay, he's going to open the hatch and IVT. Gordo, let me tell you a little more on that docking latch. When I looked at it, of course my handle was flush against the edge and it was also - essentially - locked in position. But since the bungee was down on the thing I took hold of It and I felt that the hook itself was loose. Okay, so I took the handle and the handle will come back- would come back once you pressed the little button you know to release the handle. The handle would come back to about a 45 degree position just like it normally does when you try to cock the latches. Okay, with the handle back in that 45 degree position, then I grabbed hold of the hook and brought the hook off of the docking ring with my finger and back to about that 45 degree position again just like it was comparable to the first cocked position. And that's the way it is right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 46:59 CST 22:32 MC 215/1
046:59:00|SC|Okay, one piece of tape coming up shortly, provided I can find the tape. Ah, here it is. Okay, Gordo, I'm running up through the tunnel from America to Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Piece of tape coming up. I'll tell you, Gordo, it's remarkably clean up here. It doesn't look likee snow storm that I remember coming into last time.
|CAPCOM|Rog, understand. (garble)
|SC|(garble) up here. Hey, you did a good job, friend. Hey, that's good, where is it? Oh, you you can see it! Is it straight out there? Let me see, I want to see. I want to take a look at it, too. Hey, there it is, sticking straight out. Okay, Houston, America has a VHF antenna - looks deployed perfectly.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, you guys are upside down in there. (Laughter). The commander's window has a slight amount of condensation on the lower left edge - that's the lefthand edge, really. It seems to be just there as the sun warms the window.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Okay, Houston, 74 on 1-3.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Geez, what was that? What was that from? What the hell is this?
|CAPCOM|Sounds like the cabin (garble) is working ok ay .
|SC|Holy smoly. Did the heart beat go up on that. (Laugheter). Sun's out - there's sun out in the AOT.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I'm looking out the "V" and I see a VHF antenna and part of a umbra radar antenna in position one. Position two looks right in the radar antenna and, as I said yesterday, it was beautiful.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Position three, I see the other side of America and very, very clean air, very clean. Okay, I got a good view of the side of the service module and you can see these little blisters in the side of the covering there quite distinctly. I think people were talking about those before.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Yeah, I take that back. That's the side of - that's the side of the command module we're looking at that has the little blisters on it. Got to get oriented up here.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 22:52 GET 47:19 MC 217/1
047:19:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 47 hours 18 minutes. That completes the tape from this afternoon. At this time Apollo 17 is 79 293 nautical miles from the Moon. With the lunar referenced velocity of 3343 feet per second. The flight director has just gotten another update on the S-IVB impact prediction, based on tracking to date. The newest prediction is that the impact will occur at an elapsed time of 86 hours 59 minutes 55 seconds, at 3 degrees 58 minutes south latitude, 12 degrees 35 minutes west longitude. While that tape was playing, there were several conversations with the crew. Including one between Brigadier General Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan. Stafford was Cernan's spacecraft commander in both Gemini and Apollo. We'll play those conversations for you now and then come back up live.
|SC|Hous ton, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead. 17 Houston, go ahead.
|SC|I need to make a correction. Roger, I need to make a correction. It looks as if that storm area that was in New Zealand yesterday has moved up across the two islands and is now sitting northwest. It's getting a little hard to identify the smaller islands in the Pacific but pretty sure I've got it in the right place now looking at the map. And it is northwest of New Zealand and it looks like New Zealand is probably having reasonably good weather today, although I suspect it rained last night.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. That's interesting because on my prog it doesn't show a thing down that area. It just may not be up to date here yet.
|SC|Well, there may be nothing down there except some cloud patterns and - but that's all I can see of course. The front that's south of Australia now, I presume front, just looking at a fairly well developed - although narrow cloud line, is about by about 10 degrees south of Perth right now, southwest of Perth, and runs on a northwest-southeast line over to a point about 10 or 15 degrees southwest of Tasmania. And then it intersects a curved front that runs from there up to Tasmania, and then back around down south of New Zealand about 10 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Say, Bob, this is Gene. I got some new sensors on you might want to take a look at them.
|CAPCOM|Roger, good show Gene. We were just wondering about that and I'll let you guys on my left here make sure looking at them. We're not getting any data yet, Gene.
|SC|(Garble) we're starting to get - from - just off Luzon on a northeast trend (garble) seen so far a shadow line of very thick high clouds overlying some thick lower clouds behind the front1,
|CAPCOM|Roger. You might have - be of interest board there the FIDO. Jack we've been COMM drop out there on this OMNI if you swing around on It.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 CST 22:52 GET 47:19 MC 217/2
047:19:00|SC|Okay, where did I leave you, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Well, I'm not sure because we picked up a number of different bits and then we'dropped it all.
|SC|Did you get the overcast over Korea-Manchuria bit?
|CAPCOM|Negative, I didn't get that.
|SC|Okay. That generally - south China looks clear. I haven't had a real good look at it yet it's out on the LM, It's clearly however, overcast over Korea and Manchuria. It does not appear to be frontal weather there though. The dominant front in the northwestern Pacific stretches on a northwest line from just off Luzon on up as far as I can see to determinater. And it seems to be an extremely strong front with what I would guess is heavy air—mass weather all along it and up to the east-northeast of Japan there's an excellent example of a shadow line from some very thick high clouds on solid overcast of lower clouds. Don't see any major cyclone development along it or wave development. It just looks like a very strong air-mass front.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, we've got it on our prog here. we'don't see the one on the northeast part of Japan but, we'do show a front prog for tomorrow morning going off from Taiwan and to the right of Taiwan eastward, pass the Ryukyu Island and just on into the northern Pacific there. Looks like pretty heavy cloud mass there.
|SC|Roger, that's the one I'm - Roger, that's the one I'm looking at and it's extremely heavy and right now it's — in fact it starts about in Luzon and looks like Taiwan is almost oh the back side of it.
|CAPCOM|Yeah. That's what our prog - it shows it right on Luzon and Taiwan's clear.
|SC|Very good.
|CAPCOM|We'll keep up with you yet there, Jack. Say, you may be interested. We've got 9 hours of good tracking on the — after the midcourse and we show a perilune of about 52 miles which confirms a good midcourse.
|SC|Sounds outstanding. That's great, you can cross off the canister by the way, it's changed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, EECOM's happy about that now finally. And (garble) your data looks good.
|SC|Okay. I never had a chance to tell you, Bob, but you - as you see - I presume I - the LMV no longer had sensors on .
|CAPCOM|Roger. We confirm that.
|SC|By the way, those were the - as you know the censors that we put on at the Cape, and they still seem to be in good shape when I took them off. I figured I'd let things rest a while and then I'll put them on again tomorrow.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/8/72 GET 47:27 CST 23:02 MC 218/1
047:27:00|SC|No way, you got a longer history than I do.
|CAPCOM|Everything's looking great.
|SC|Yeah, it's looking good on board. We're - I think we're pretty well squared away. We've got our stowage in shape and we're in the hous ecleaning routine and that's about fifty percent of the battle.
|CAPCOM|Right.
|SC|The weather down there didn't look too good today. How's it been?
|CAPCOM|Well, when it started out, it was below minimums this morning and finally, this afternoon, it cleared up, but it was strictly zilch this morning and starting last night. There's another front due in here later tonight.
|SC|Yeah, we've been watching that one.
|CAPCOM|Well, Jack, you're turning into a trained weather observer besides being a geologist.
|SC|Oh, I'm enjoying it immensely, Tom, as you may have gathered.
|CAPCOM|Right.
|SC|Very interesting place to watch, I'll tell you.
|CAPCOM|Absolutely superb.
|SC|How are things on the home front, TP?
|CAPCOM|Well, Gene-o, things couldn't be better.
|SC|Yeah, well, you might pass on all the good word from us.
|CAPCOM|Oh, yeah, will do. I plan to drop by and bum a cup of coffee tomorrow.
|SC|I'd love to invite you up here for supper.
|CAPCOM|I wish I could join you. I could make another couple of remarks but they'd be X-rated, so I shouldn't.
|SC|Okay, I'll accept that. Do you notice I haven't, yet.
|CAPCOM|I'm very well pleased, Gene-o. Your language is superb. 17, Houston, just a couple of words. We'd like you to know we're real satisfied with all the LM data that we saw during the LM activation work today, and, looking at it, the data looked real good.
|SC|Great, Bob. You had me worried there for awhile with that COMM. Do you have a good idea what caused that?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we're sure about 99.9 percent it was just ground linkup.
|SC|Yeah, that's certainly the way it acted on board.
|CAPCOM|I guess there won't be any need to go back and change the checklist on that but there's a lot to be said for maybe going to a real good stable condition and getting a good firm checkout before you go into that down voice backup mode and things like that, and I think that's what we'd do in the future.

|SC|Say, I'm just a little curious about the difficulty on holding the OMNIs, is that about the same as past missions or are we loosing a little bit more than us ual.
|CAPCOM|We're going to have Ed here give us a discription for a minute so let me stand by.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Jack, according to that - to starward INCO over there, due to this new 210 down at Tin Bin Billa, we are holding actually longer than the past history.
|SC|Okay, I just guess I've never been on this end before.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Do you hear it on board when we break like that.
|SC|Yes, matter of fact with our squelch enabled we loose all the background noise and we know when we're picking you up because we start to get background noise again.
|CAPCOM|Roger, in other words you are able to stop talking or something when when you know we're breaking like that?
|SC|Well, if we haven't been talking we'd break lock, no unless we're watching the meter we want, we loose you when you get about 55 say 60 percent signal strength and apparently we're not talking to you when we have less than that.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Yeah, INCO gave me a briefing tonight and showed me what chart to watch so I can look at numbers when to talk, I've been talking myself to much lately.
|SC|Yeah, they have a beautiful chart there for that purpose.
|CAPCOM|I never really wanted to be an INCO BUT I guess I was forced to tonight.

047:48:00|SC|There are lots of comments for that one, Bob, but I'd better not say anything.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|You'd never speak to me again.
|CAPCOM|Well, that's all right. We can't X rate the transcripts so we'll just have to take it easy.
|SC|Say, Bob, I've got another question about the Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, sir.
|SC|Yes sir. The battery voltage on low taps - strangely enough was just like the simulator but I had expected that the simulator might have been wrong - that we would have seen higher voltage there. Is that about what you guys expected?
|CAPCOM|Roger, they said they expected that because the extra time on the pad that they're running. That 2 hour 40 minute delay is coming into play again.
|SC|Oh, yeah, yeah. ;That's right. Good. I forgot all about that. Something made that slip my mind.
|CAPCOM|Well, things have been going so well that I can't blame you for forgetting that.
|SC|That Stanley Holloway's crazy flight plan updates that we've just forgotten we were that late.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Say, by the way, we like the music in the background - sounds pretty good.
|SC|Yeah, we sort of - we'didn't get it out at all until today. I don't know whether we forgot about it or too many other learning things going on. It's quite Ple as an t .
|CAPCOM|Rog* I don't think you forgot about it. I think you were just glued to those windows.
|SC|Well, I still am as a matter of fact. The old Earth's coming by and say, I mentioned a couple of fronts that joined together about 20 degrees south of — of — the south coast of Australia - and it looks like that's a fairly healthy storm center developing down In there, conceivably may migrate up across Tasmania and may be up — up the Sidney - Brisbane coastal area in the next few days.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Where is the exact center of that Jack? It took me a second to get my prog out here.
|SC|Just a second, let me give you better info from the map.
|CAPCOM|Roger. While you're looking at your map, I just might mention to Gene, I just talked to your better half over there and everybody's fine and happy.

Here in the Control Room, flight director Gene Kranz and his white team are preparing to relieve the orange team which has been directed tonight by flight director Chuck Lewis. Major activities during this shift have been the heat flow and convection demonstration which has been performed twice during this shift. Once, while the spacecraft was nulled in all three axes and again after the passive thermal control spinup mode had been established. That demonstration is to provide data on behavior of fluids in a low gravity field and the information learned from the demonstration could be valuable in the future science experiments and perhaps for manufacturing processes in space.

It looks as if, from yesterday, it's moved quiet a bit to the west.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we concur the prog for 12:00, let's see that's about 6 hours from now. Shows it to be right over the Viet Nam area, the Viet Nam Peninsula there, so looks like it's moving the way they are proging it, huh.
|SC|Yeah, it certainly is. It's moved from just a little bit west of Luzon over to the coast there so it's a pretty healthy storm.
|CAPCOM|Roger. It looks on the prog chart here it looks real tight, it's a very - very centralized thing in a real tight circular.
|SC|Oh yeah, youbetterbelieve it, it is really, it is tight, it's really no bigger than the, in terms of cloud pattern, no bigger than the — say South Viet Nam itself.
|CAPCOM|Roger. How're you getting that, Jack, are you looking with the monocular now?
|SC|That's affirm. Monocular still gives real good resolution on the cloud patterns. Naked eye you just see the masses, but with the 10 power monocular it's perfectly adequate for seeing the kind of patterns we're talking about.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I understand. Well, guys, I guess I wont get the chance to say goodnight to you because Parker's going to come in to put you to bed.

048:52:00|PAO|At the present time in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz is going around the room polling each of his Flight Controllers on the mission status and all the reports are coming up very good. The orbital science officer said that the temperatures in the SIMBAY where the various scientific instruments will be used in Lunar orbit to observe the Moon from orbit appear to be about as would be expected at this time. During the previous shift the film in the panoramic and mapping cameras was cycled and this is done once every 24 hours if the cameras are not used, to prevent the pressure points on the film in the transport mechanism from creating striations in the film emulsion, and those cameras are cycled ahead several frames to move that pressure point around on the film emulsion. During Lunar molule housekeeping when the crew entered the LM on the previous shift, everything looked to be in order in that vehicle. And the guidance and control officer reports that the midcourse correction maneuver performed earlier in the day — was very close to nominal. Also, the command module is running a bit ahead of the flight plan schedule as far as reaction control system propellent usage and service propulsion system propellent usage and we have a bit more than predicted for this point in the flight. And the Electrical Environmental Communications Officer, EECOM, said that in general the command module -the command and service module appear to be in very good shape. Apollo 17, at this time, is 75 975 nautical miles from the Moon and we're showing a velocity with respect to the Moon of 3325 feet per second. we'don't anticipate any further conversation with the crew, having said "goodnight" to them - and we are planning to give them an additional 30 minutes on their rest period if they so desire. The rest period, according to the flight plan, is scheduled to end at a ground elapsed time of 56 hours. However, we'do not plan to put in a call to the crew until 56 hours 30 minutes, giving them the option to sleep an additional 30 minutes if they so desire. We showed at 48 hours 38 minutes, or about 23 minutes ago, that they had turned off the voice sub-carriers indicating that they were preparing to bed down and get to sleep. During this sleep shift we'll plan to have the air-to-ground lines down to minimize the amount of noise on these circuits. we'll be recording any conversation with the crew and will be prepared to bring the lines up in very short order should we have any calls from the crew. At 49 hours 2 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

049:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 49 hours 57 minutes. It's been nearly an hour and a half since we said goodnight to the crew and there's been no change in the status of the spacecraft or operations here in the Control Center. Everything's progressing along very smoothly at this point. we'don't expect to put in a call to the crew until 56 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time or about 6 and a half hours from now. Apollo 17 is now 74 098 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity is 3 317 feet per second with respect to the Moon. The flight dynamics officer has the option of setting up the display which gives us the velocity of the spacecraft and its distance relative to either the Moon or the Earth. His option is to look at the spacecraft position and velocity with respect to the Moon or to Earth. At the present time, we are looking at those parameters with respect to the Moon. The large display plot up on the large 10 by 20 foot describing plotter display at the front of the Control Center shows us that the spacecraft is now 'approaching 160 000 nautical miles from Earth. At 49 hours 59 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston. END oF TAPE

050:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 50 hours 58 min utes. The crew has been in a rest period now for about 2 1/2 hours. The Flight Surgeon has had bio-medical data on the Commander, Gene Cernan. It indicates that at least Cernan is soundly asleep at this time and we presume that all 3 crew members are sleeping. Wake up call is scheduled for 56 hours 30 minutes or about 5 and a half hours from now. Apollo 17, currently 160 762 nautical miles from Earth and we're showing the spacecraft 72 200 miles from the Moon and its continued to be very quiet in Mission Control, almost no conversation on the loops here and no change in any of the systems aboard the spacecraft - everything going along very smoothly and performing well at this time. The cabin temperature at the point we monitor it, that's where our telemetry which is the outlet of the air flowing into the cabin, shows the temperature at that point to be about 63 degrees. The cabin temperature itself would be somewhat warmer than that, probably up around room temperature — 68, 69 , 70 degrees - in that area. At 50 hours 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

051:58:00|PAO|This Is Apollo Control at 51 hours 57 minutes. We've had no signs of any activities from the Spacecraft and it appears that the crew is sleeping at this time. Apollo 17 some 70 200 nautical miles from the Moon. And we have a clock counting down to the time at which the crew is scheduled to awake - some 4 hours from now. Actually, that would be the earliest that we would expect to hear from them and prior to beginning the rest period we advised them that we would not plan to put in a call until about 30 minutes later than called for in the flight plan. They were about a half hour late getting the rest period. Tomorrow's schedule is relatively uncluttered and Flight Director, Gene Kranz, decided to give them the extra 30 minutes of sleep if they desire to take it. On awakening the - one of the main activities in the flight plan for today has the crew re-entering the lunar module, Challenger and partially powering the vehicle up and running some additional checks. And there has been no change in the status of the spacecraft based on the telemetry information we're getting here in Mission Control - everything continues to perk along very smoothly. At 51 hours 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

052:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 52 hours 57 minutes. We're now midway through a scheduled 8 hour crew sleep period. And it continues to be very quite here in mission control. No signs of activity aboard the spacecraft, and everything going along very smoothly. The flight dynamics officer has been working on the trajectory, and looking at tracking data as a result of the midcourse correction performed yesterday. And at this point it appears that no further midcourse maneuvers will be required to get Apollo fif - Apollo 17 into lunar orbit at the desired altitude and time. However, the flight dynamics officer is going to reserve final decision on that point probably until tomorrow. Although it does appear certain at this point that there will be no midcourse correction required at the midcourse correction three opportunity. And probably not even at midcourse correction four. Our data displays at this time show Apollo 17 68 237 nautical miles from the Moon. And on a different display we're reading 165 5 84 nautical miles back to Earth. At 52 hours 59 minutes this is Apollo control Hous ton.

053:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 53 hours 57 minutes continuing very quiet at Mission Control. Now about two and one half hours remaining in the crew sleep period. The flight plan calls for the sleep period to end at 56 hours Ground Elapsed Time, however, we'don't plan to give them a call until 56:30, giving them the option to sleep for an additional 30 minutes. Apollo 17 now 167 000 nautical miles from Earth and we are showing velocity with respect to the Moon at 3 293 feet per second, some 66 300 nautical miles from the Moon at this time. This is Apollo Control at 53 hours 58 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 GET 54:51 CST 0630 MC 2 30/1
054:51:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 54 hours 5 7 minutes, some 1 hour 33 minutes now from the scheduled crew awakening time. What has been a very uneventful sleep shift for the crew and a very quiet period here in Mission Control. After the crew awakes, one of the activities on their schedule . for the day will be to update the clocks for the spacecraft, we'll be updating the clocks here in Mission Control at the same time. This clock update is occasioned by the fact that we lifted off 2 hours 40 minutes late from Cape Kennedy, however, in order to place the spacecraft in lunar orbit at the same diurnal time or the same Sun time, and retain the lighting conditions desired for the lunar landing, the translunar injection burn was given a slight bit longer burn - just a little bit more energy put into that burn — trip time to the Moon decreased by 2 hours and 40 minutes. The net effect of this is that we now arrive at the Moon at the same time that we would have arrived had the liftoff been on time. One other effect is that the crew has a net 2 hours and 40 minutes less time to accomplish those things that needed to be accomplished in the translunar coast. This is of small consequence because the translunar coast time is relatively a slack period for them, however, in order to avoid any sudden shift in sleep periods and that sort of thing, the time has been made up in two increments - the first one of 1 hour at 45 hours in the flight plan. The crew activities were jumped ahead by 1 hour and they essentially began doing those things that were called for 1 hour later in the flight plan. They will again jump ahead an hour and 40 minutes and that'll occur at 65 hours. By that time they will have completed all those activities required up through 67 hours 40 minutes in the flight plan. Or, in other words, they'll have completed all of the activities required to get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes early and in order to make the clocks then agree with where the crew will be in the flight plan, we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. This clock update which can be likened to going on daylight saving time, only 2 hours and 40 minutes worth of change instead of 1 hour of change as we'do on daylight savings time, will occur at 65 hours when the crew will have completed all of those flight plan activities up through 67 hours and 40 minutes. This simply involves setting our clocks at 65 hours in the Control Center and aboard the spacecraft at 65 hours, moving them ahead to 67 hours 40 minutes. Then, barring any further changes in the mission timeline from that point on, the elapsed time clocks which are used as the cue to flight plan activities, should agree with the flight plan and events that - in the flight plan are called out for a certain time will happen at that time on the elapsed time clocks in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. This is a convenience factor. The other alternative wodd be to go through the flight plan and change all of the flight plan times to agree with the clocks. We simply find it easier to change the clocks and avoid having to make all those updates to the flight plan. At the present time, Apollo 17 1*01nautical miles from the Moon and we're showing 169 518 nautical miles from Earth. Spacecraft velocity at i?fiaPfeSent tllne' aSaln with respect to the Moon, is 3289 feet per second. And we are now 1 hour 27 minutes away tlme at which we anticipate the crew will be awakening.

055:57:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 55 hours 57 minutes. We're about 30 minutes away from the scheduled crew awakening time. And we've seen no signs of activity aboard the spacecraft at this point, however, we could hear from the crew almost any time between now and the next 30 minutes. And if we haven't heard from them within about 30 minutes we'll be putting in a call - a wake up call to the crew. Here in the control center the next team of flight controllers beginning to come on duty. Flight director, Neil Hutchinson, will be relieving flight director, Gene Kranz. And the spacecraft communicator on the upcoming shift is to be astronaut Gordon Fullerton. He'll be replacing CAPCOM, Bob Parker. Apollo 17, at this time, is 62 thousand 415 nautical miles from the moon and traveling at a speed of some 3 thousand 280 feet per second and we show a range to Earth now of 170 thousand 6 hundred 50 nautical miles. We'll bring up the lines and monitor lines at this point for any call from the crew. At 55 hours 59 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.

|CAPCOM|Good morning, Apollo 17, it's Houston, over.
|PAO|Apparently the crew has not turned on the downlink on their transmitter. That was the University of Kansas J-Hawk Fight Song, which is Ron Evans Alma Mater.

|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning. Are you with us this morning?
|PAO|As they say in the entertainment music business, one more time. We're going to send crew alert and when we see the voice up carrier up we're going to roll the tape again, the Jayhawk Fight song. The crew is very sleepy this morning or else they have their volume turned down where they can't hear the music. At 56:49 standing by, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 08:22 CST 56: 49 GET MC234/1
00056::00|PAO|We are now sending crew alert. Gene Cernan's pulse rate still at about 49 which indicates the klaxon didn't wake him up. No indication yet that the spacecraft transmitter's has been turned on.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apparently the crew either does not have their volume turned up enough to hear the calls from the ground or perhaps the ear plug has slipped out of the ear of the crewman who's to monitor last night which I understand was Evans. Therefore, about every 10 minutes the Capcom is going to give a wake up call to the crew again in an attempt to raise them. Spacecraft Communicator Bob Parker is - has unplugged from the Capcom Console and is being replaced by Gordo Fullerton, And when we see on telemetry that the voice subcarrier from the spacecraft has been turned on, we'll play the old fight song again: Jayhawk Fight Song, University of Kansas. And, eventually we may get these sleepheads awake. At 56:58 ground elapsed time, Apollo 17 is 60 471 nautical miles out from the Moon, approaching at a velocity of 3 2 85 and our slant range in nautical miles from the Earth to the spacecraft is 171 985 nautical miles.

|SC|Okay, on your CDR PRD 17028, claims 7-1/2 hours of good sleep. He had a Seconal before going to bed, and since the last reporting, he's had 4 containers of water.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, with respect to food, let's see, . we gave you a intermediate report yesterday. Do you want that repeated?
|CAPCOM|Negative.
|SC|Well, I'm not sure I can differentiate what I said yesterday so I'd just better give it all to you. This is yesterdays complete report.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|CDR was scrambled eggs, 3 bacon squares, peaches, pineapple-grapefruit drink, peanut butter, jelly, bread, chocolate bars, orange drink, apricot, that's dried apricot, 1 frankfurter, a third of a fruitcake, half a beef steak, butterscotch pudding, orange drink and tea.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got that.

Scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, 7 toast bread, orange juice, cocoa, peanut butter, jelly, bread, cherry bar, citrus beverage, fruitcake, butterscotch pudding, orange drink, turkey and gravy, 2 frankfurters and tea. You might say he was a little logy. Okay, CMP PRD 1502 7, 7 and let's - make that 8 hours of very good sleep, he claims he didn't get to sleep for awhile.

|SC|Okay. Well, now that we're eating well, that may be the best way to do it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I have your consumables status, if everybody that's interested is listening.
|SC|Go ahead, Gordon.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Your RCS is running right along at 1.3 percent above the flight plan line. On your cryos the 02 tanks 2 and 3 are right on the line. Tank 1 is still as before about 4 percent below the line, but looking real good. On hydrogen, you're a little above on 1 tank, on tank 2; a little bit below on tank 3, but the average is right with the flight plan lines. So consumables look good. Over.
|SC|Okay. That's good to hear.
|SC|And, I see that old SPS oxidizer pressure has dropped some more. I guess the helium is working it's way in there, or out of there.
|CAPCOM|Okay. That's the way it looks to us.
|CAPCOM|One final thing. Management has informed me that since you've been so late getting to work this morning, we are going to have to dock you all at a day's annual leave.
|SC|All of us ! I can understand, I can understand that for the Commander, since he's always the Commander (garble) , but I do not understand why the LMP loses an hour.
|SC|Hello Houston, this is America.
|CAPCOM|Hello Geno, good morning.
|AMERICA|Hello Gordo. Request is that I handle the disciplinary problems up here, how's that?
|CAPCOM|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Geno, we have FAO work on a good time on the flight plan later here to work in a Captain's mast.
|SC|Okay, (chuckle) that'll be great.
|SC|Hey, Gordy, for the record; I swallowed three of those gas pills yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 58 hours 11 minutes ground elapsed time into the Mission of Apollo 17. The crew at this time having a belated breakfast, having overslept about an hour, despite many attempts to raise them by playing the Kansas fight-song and the crew alarm being sent up on the up-link, which causes a warbling sound in the headsets. However, apparently, Ron Evans, who was on watch was unable to hear, since likely the earplug had fallen out of his ear while stirring around in his sleep. Some amount of levity there is - it was suggested that their pay be docked or they should be charged with one hour of annual leave at any rate. The spacecraft is presently 58 073, it's just now changed, 58 067 nautical miles out from the Moon approaching an ever increasing velocity as they draw near the moon now 3284 feet per second.

|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, that little stormy - fairly big storm that was off the coast of north west Africa yesterday has moved inland and presumably is giving those people up there some weather, might even be getting some snow up in the Atlas Mountains. It's still fairly well organized and inland a few hundred miles or - the edge of it inland a few hundred miles. The people at the Cape of Good Hope ought to be seeing some clouds - forerunners of a large circulation system that's south - southwest of them. That although large it seems to have most of it's heavy clouds to the southeast of the center and they may not get any major weather out of this one. But, they'll probably have cloudiness for a few days. The storm that was over Buenos Aires yesterday is fairly moved out to sea and is now west - or east southeast of that area. Otherwise the - except for those 3 storm areas the south Atlantic looks relatively calm. The zero phase point is now off the east coast of South America and it looks fairly dull and grey and I suspect no extensive chopiness in that area,
|CAPCOM|Jack, take a breather there we got antenna break coming.
|CAPCOM|Okay Jack, we're back with you and listening.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, I can't see you right now, I think that was about the extent of it. We'll get some food and while I'm eating I'll look at it and see if there are any more de t ail s .

It was foggy when I came to work, but understand the sun is out now and the fog is burned off. On the International-National scene, there's another reported snag in negotiations between Dr. Henry Kissinger and North Vietnams Le Due Tho. The two have discussed the peace terms since Monday, but so far little news concerning the talks has been released by either side. They meet again today. A judge in the Pentagon Papers trial on Daniel Ellsburg has declared a mistrial. Judge Matt Burn has asked that a new jury be selected. Both sides in the cases must now go back to the beginning and prepare their arguments again. Former President Harry Truman is still hospitalized with a serious heart condition. Although listed in critical condition, the 88 year old former Chief Executive has shown some improvement, according to his daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel. President Nixon has completed selection of his new cabinet by announcing that he will keep Richard Kleindienst as Attorney General. There will be a number of major changes, though, in upper levels of the Justice and Interior Departments. Life Magazine will be no more as of the end of December. The pictorial magazine lost over 30 million dollars during the past four years. No doubt some of the final pictures to appear in the famous 36 year old publication will be those of the Apollo 17 mission. An airliner crashed at Midway Airport in Chicago, Friday. Of the 61 persons aboard, only 18 survived the crash. In other national and international highlights, unemployment figures show a drop to the lowest level in two years. 5.6 billion dollars has been released by the federal government in the first revenue sharing payment to the state and local goverments, and the NATO Foreign Ministers have urged the Soviet Union to cut down troop strength and allow freer movement of people over the east-west borders. In local and regional news, new hijack control devices have been installed at Houston Intercontinental Airport. The new metal detectors are being installed in many airports around the United States. New inspection procedures will also begin in January of all hand luggage carried aboard airliners. And on the sport page, A1 Conover is not going to return to Wake Forest as rumored. The Rice coach has met with University President Dr. Norman Hackerman to discuss a firm five year contract agreement. Professional football highlights today's sports, the "Over-The-Hill-Gang" from Washington with Billy Kilmer and Larry Brown will take on the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium in Irving. The Cowboys will no doubt go with Craig Morton at quarterback. Dallas can insure itself of a "Wild Card" slot in the playoffs with the Redskins, if they win. For Dallas it's a revenge game.

058:54:00|CAPCOM|Johny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds all- everything catcher, has been hospitalized for tests. X—ray showed a spot on a lung. Doctors feel sure the lesion is benign, though. The University of Houston basketball team takes on Xavier tonight. The Cougars, with four wins and one loss, will face a Xavier, team that likes to play slowdown basketball. The Houston Rockets beat the Portland, Oregon Trailblazers last night in Hofheinz, 114 to 108. The Big Eight Athletic Conference has joined the Big Ten and the Ohio Athletic Conference in breaking relations with the U.S. Olympic Committee. Back in Houston again, Bill Peterson, the Oiler Coach, says he's not planning on new Assistant Coaches. He says the Oilers need more togetherness with their coaches, not new ones. And a final item, the Des Moines, Iowa Post Office was emptying a mail pouch. One package fell on the floor, broke open, and spilled all over the place. The contents were Postal Service instructions on how to wrap and mail packages to insure safe transit and delivery.
|SC|Very good news report, Gordo -
|SC|Yes, that crash in Chicago, can you tell me a little bit more about it?
|CAPCOM|I read real briefly in the paper, just before I came in that it did crash in a populated area, so it's a very brief report. I don't think the final details have been published yet. I'll check to see if we've got anymore in.
|SC|Okay, and I guess you know where - at least my wishes go for that Cowboy game, don't you?
|CAPCOM|I'm not sure that I do.
|SC|I'll just let you make an assumption.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got an antenna switch coming h e re .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 10:34 CST 59:01 GET MC246/1
059:01:00|CAPCOM|17, Houston. I have a little more on the plane crash, if you'd like to hear it.
|SC|Yes sir, Gordy- Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It was a United Airlines jet, 61 people aboard, and it crashed into a south-side Chicago neighborhood while trying to land at Midway. Most of the 55 passengers - they were - I'm not sure I'm getting all the numbers right here but it said here that most of the 55 passengers were found dead in the debris and it was a Boeing 737 about a half a mile away from the airport. One of the victims was representative George Collins, a Democrat from Illinois, who was returning from Washington to organize a children's Christmas party. The weather, at the time, was 500 foot ceiling and one mile visibility and sleet and snow were falling at the time. There were no reports that any occupants of the houses were injured or killed. I turn back to the back of the paper, here. A United spokesman said one of the six crew members, a stewardess, was among 16 persons admitted to Holy Cross Hospital. She said there were 2 infants among the passengers. Jet apparently missed runway 13 at Midway on -that cruised over the neighborhood of bungalow homes at heights of 500 to 1000 feet and then with his nose up and tail down tore into the dwellings. Witnesses said the plane scraped the roofs of 2 bungalows and sheared through 6 houses, setting them aflame. The fuselage of the airliner split but the nose remained intact. A tail section was sticking out of one house. The following airliner sheared through utility lines and a 2 square mile area was blacked out. Telephone service was knocked out. A power company spokesman said 5000 homes were affected.
|SC|Okee-doke.
|CAPCOM|And a little news about your trajectory. Since the midcourse 2 you've been looking real good. You've -you're homing in on 53 1/2 mile parallel. We're discussing midcourse 4, which if we'do it at all, is going to be very small. Its looking like about a foot and a half per second right now. And I guess if we'do it, it will only be because it will save us Delta V at L0I. Over.
|SC|Okay, I was just looking. Those dumps really knocked us for a loop, didn't they?
|CAPCOM|Yes, it - it's driving your PTC out.
|SC|Yes, we're at almost 40 degrees, now.
|SC|Gordy, has the temperature been pretty cold down there?
|CAPCOM|Here in Houston it warmed up considerably last night - yesterday afternoon and last night and this morning it's probably in the 60*s somewhere.
|SC|Garble.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 10:44 CST 59:11 GET MC 247/1
059:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 59 hours 11 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 17 currently is 56 148 nautical miles out from the Moon closing on the Moon at 3284 feet per second. Distance from Earth is now 175 441 nautical miles. We'll continue to leave the line up as we proceed into today's activities which includes another activation and check out of the lunar module and hopefully today the communications noise will be somewhat less than it was yesterday. At 59:13 standing by, this is Apollo Control.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, I have some words about the troubles we had during the LM comm checks yesterday, if you have a free moment to listen.
|SC|Go ahead, Gordy, we're listening.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we think we've got a pretty good handle on what the problem was and that was that the - the LM communications gear, we think was jumping on the voice sub carrier rather than the main carrier and the symptoms that we had point to that. What would happen is when I would try to transmit that it would lose lock soon as I put modulation on the voice sub carrier. During the checks today, we're gonna try to verify that the system is indeed working okay and we can do it without any changes in the onboard procedures by — purely by procedures that will be handled at the ground site and here at Mission Control and so that's what we're planning to do. We really don't -the problem that happened has been seen before evidently and it's not that unusual. We really don't think there's anything wrong with the onboard equipment. Over.
|SC|Sounds good, Gordy. We'll just take her slow and easy when I get over there today and make sure we understand it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and there's real no voice check scheduled and we'don't think any are required. We can tell what we need to without any voice checks again.
|SC|Gordy, you're breaking up, talk to you as soon as we get another omni.
|CAPCOM|Okay1.
|SC|While I got, I took 3 pictures of the Earth. Thought I might have moved one of them and we're on frame 145.
|SC|Did you copy, Gordy?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack, I copy, you may not be reading me through the omni switcher.
|SC|Okay, that was mag November, November.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 10:55 CST 59:22 GET MC 248/1
059:22:00|SC|Houston, 17. Do you want us to go into a battery B charge?
|CAPCOM|Let me check, Jack. That's affirmative, go ahead.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Battery B is being charged. And Gordy, different than the life - last time the charger amps is moving up very slowly started out at about 2 tenths and now it's one amp, little more, it's still going up. Before it jumped right up to about 2 amps. Is that expected?
|CAPCOM|Oh - we'll check on that. Stand by.
|SC|Gordy the LM/CM Delta P is .6, you still want to take the command module up?
|CAPCOM|Geno, that'll be fine, you will not have to jack up the command module pressure.
|SC|Okay, I think I'll maneuver it attitude then.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds good.
|CAPCOM|Jack, the way the amps are going to look when you put the charger on is the function of the state of the charge of the battery and what you describe is about what we'd expect considering where the battery should be.
|SC|Okay, that's what I figured. It's up about 11and 3/4 amps now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And it appears to be stable.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordy, I'm in the process of - I'm in the process of putting biomed sensors on.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, Houston, 17. Thanks to a little South Carolina boy we had up here last time, we've got some grits up here, and they're really not too bad. A little butter on them and a little bit dry - of course, you could add a little more water to it then they'd be a little better, but not bad at all.
|CAPCOM|I can't believe I'm hearing that from a real Y an k e e .
|SC|Of course, Kansas is not exactly Yankee.
|SC|Let me tell you that does not apply to the little old farm boy from Chicago.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|As you students of American History may recall, Kansas caused a lot of the problem we had with those 21people.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And grits is causing the rest of it.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. We see that you're making a maneuver uncoupled in pitch and we'd rather you make it coupled to keep FIDO happy, over.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Yeah that was my fault, Gordo, I screwed up here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 11:06 CST 59:33 GET MC249/1

|SC|Okay, repress vacuum valves off.
|CAPCOM|(Garble).
|SC|Hello, Gordy. You with us?
|CAPCOM|Yes. How do you read?
|SC|We're reading you loud and clear. The emergency cabin pressure select is off, and we're about ready to open the equalization valve.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And we're ready for the high-gain.
|SC|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control 59 hours 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. The crew, at this time, making preparations for entry into the lunar module.
|SC|Gordy, that's the high-gain. How do you like it?
|CAPCOM|Looking good.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. I was reading .2 on the Delta P and the hatch is cracked.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Hey, Houston, 17. How do you read the LMP ' s b iome d?
|CAPCOM|Let me check.
|CAPCOM|Jack, the EKG looks great. Your ZPN looks like a sensor might be loose. And we'll be handing over here in about 30 seconds.
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|Okay, we're in the process of getting the probe and drogue out. I've pushed on the sensors real hard again and see if that helps it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll take a look.
|SC|That helped it. Don't worry about it until we call you again.
|SC|Descend to that one, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|You've always been one of those smooth talkers.
|SC|They're down there somewhere.
|SC|Okay, the probe is out. And we'll try the drogue now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 11:28 GET 59:55 MC-250/1
059:55:00|SC|Okay the drogue is out and we're going up to take another look at Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene.
|SC|Somebody left their lights on in here.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|It's just like a refrigerator.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Docking index is unchanged.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's a plus 1.2. Right?
|SC|That's affirm.
|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston. Over.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. When you get a moment, when it's convenient, we'd like you to go up to the latch #4 there, the one that's been giving us trouble and we'd like you - - Well, we think it's just half cocked and we'd like you to stroke it. We think it will probably cock on one - with one stroke. We'd like you to stroke it at least twice more to verify that it is really cocked. And as you do stroke the handle, we'd like you to notice approximately what point in the throw that the resistance increases. We can summarize what we want you to do if you keep us advised as you go along.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|We - We're going to leave it cocked then from here on until redocking after rendezvous, well, - we'don't want to -we'don't want you to fire it.
|SC|Sure. Understand.
|SC|Houston. We're transferring to LM power.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Houston. I'm going to give them LM power for the GO.
|SC|Reset and OFF. And we have LM power.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 11:35 GET 60:05 MC-251/1
060:05:00|SC|Gordo, this is Geno.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Gene.
|SC|Okay. While my compatriots are carrying out their respective tasks, I'm going to go off the air for a few short minutes. And, I'll give you a call when I get back.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And, I'm in step three, Gordy on 2-2.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Houston. America here. I'm on my docking latch #4 now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|SC|Okay, the handle itself is free swinging up to a point about 1 inch beyond the back side of the j-hook.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And, I'll go ahead and try to cock it now.
|SC|Gordy, ED Batts are 37.2 and 37.2 and the Buss voltages are 26.2 and I'll bring you on the high taps.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. Sounds good.
|SC|And Houston. As we all suspected it has one cock on it, or it had one cock. Now it's fully cocked. And the handle itsefl is free-swinging. The plunger has depressed, ohh, almost 3 quarters of an inch from the top. And it is no longer parallel with the surface.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|Okay. When you look back in the side of it there, that little j-hook with the snowman in it, the snowman's head points - as you look directly at the side of it it points -the snowman's head is at 8:00 and the connecting link from the one that connects - the one that goes into the plunger to - to the little fat J-bar there, is parallel with that slot, so that the point of the J sticks out.
|SC|So it is indeed fully cocked.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Sounds good and that's where we'd like to leave it.
|SC|Okay. Will do.
|SC|Okay. Step 5, 2-3.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Houston. Step 5 complete. Glycol pressure is 21, it's down down about PSI from yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. Copy.
|SC|And, Houston, is magazine II a good one to use for a - some opportunity interior photos?
|CAPCOM|Let me check, Ron.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, II sounds good.
|SC|Hope so. Looks like that's the only one I h ave .
|CAPCOM|Do you, - Do you recall when you did the Heat-Flow on HH, have you used all of HH up on that experiment?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 11:35 GET 60:05 MC-251/2
060:05:00|CAPCOM|Don't get it out to look for, just wondered if you remembered.
|SC|That's for. No it ran out. It didn't - I got the complete cool-down part of the ex - of the experiment on HH and then switched to high. I got about 2 minutes of high before the film ran out again. Had a high power on the - on the - -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Thank you.
|SC|After the main part of the experiment was complete.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we're copying LM data now.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. Beautiful. I was just going to say step six is complete.
|SC|Houston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Roger. I just was thinking while I was waiting here the cleanliness of these two spacecraft is certainly a tribute to the - all the people at Grumman and Downey and at the Cape, who worked so hard to put them that way.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'll make sure they hear about it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 11:50 GET 60:17 252/1
060:17:00|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. We're - we've looked at the LM data and it looks perfect, no problems at all. What we're doing right now, though, is the checkout on the carrier and subcarrier lockups on the LM comm. So far, we've had no trouble with it, but we haven't quite completed routinely what we wanted to try. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I understand Gordie. No hurry h ere .
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We've completed our in vestigation of our COMM, there. It all looked good. You can put a sign on page 2-4.
|CHALLENGER|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Say, Gordie, I see I neglected to pull the bal load circuit breaker when I went to — after going to high taps. You want me to go back and show you that again?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CHALLENGER|That's the bal load breaker on 16, so the busses were tied together.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|CAPCOM|Jack, there's no need to go back. Just keep on going.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, sorry about that.
|CAPCOM|No problem.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We're all ready for the E-mod dump, if it's convenient to you.
|AMERICA|Houston, this is America, I guess that's for me isn't it ?
|CAPCOM|That's right, for Captain America.
|AMERICA|Okay, we'll get her here.
|AMERICA|Okay, Verb 74 ENTER.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're getting it.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|And Houston, we have 50 percent remaining on magazine India India.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|(garble)
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, America, we've got the dump.
|AMERICA|Okay, I understand, you have the dump.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours 35 minutes ground elapsed time. LM checkout apparently going along quite well at this time.

|CAPCOM|Okay, welcome back.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, I was just testing out the survival techniques in space.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Did you survive?
|CHALLENGER|Well, so far and we've got the LM back on CSM power.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, it's called education of necessity.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I guess the LM looked pretty good to you, huh?
|CAPCOM|Yes sir. It looked perfect and we also went through the little communications main-carrier sub-carrier lock-up check and the COMM system worked perfectly, so there's no problem at all to report.-
|CHALLENGER|Okay, fine. We'll start in with Jack donning and the PGA and then i'll follow.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, How did that ZPN turn out?
|CAPCOM|Let me get another check here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, it looks fairly good right now. Don't bother changing anything.
|CHALLENGER|Well I'm just going to be in a position to work on it in a little while and if the occasion arises, I could.
|CAPCOM|Okay* wefll keep that in mind, although, it looks reasonable at the moment. It has shown some - at sometimes it's gone from edge to edge on their scale but it has come back in right now. I'll find out later if we want to do anything.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, the electrolite pads maybe still expanding a little bit so I'm going off the air briefly to start getting into the suits and I'll talk to you in a little while.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Hello Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Hello.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're up to Frame count 151 on magazine November November they have been pictures of the primarily of the CSM out the LM windows by the CMP.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|He's been up there fooling around for a while. We may have to check it out and see what he did.

|CAPCOM|All that dropout there was because Ascension had a problem. We're now over on Madrid and you're sounding good.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, Gordo. Jack is in his suit, unzipped at this time. I'm going off the air and Ron will come on, and keep you informed as to how we're going.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Fine.
|SC|Houston. How do you read the LMP?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Okay. I'm in my suit presently unzipped. Didn't seem to be any problem at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And, Gordy, I think I found the problem with the Biomed sensors. When I come out of the suit I can fix it. I put a little of that bacterial cream on the sensor places last night as a preventive mechanism and I think it's just a little greasy to hold the sensor.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay. Gene's got his suit on and he's going to cross into the LM now.

|CAPCOM|Go ahead. America, Houston. Did you call?1'
|AMERICA|I just said, the CMP. Got my suit on now, and I had a little trouble with the donning liners getting stuck in the zipper, but I figured out how to get them out of the way now.
|CAPCOM|Okay.

061:36:00|SC|Okay, Houston. Gene has his suit pretty well off now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|CAPCOM|We reviewed the data on the R-mod. Everything looks normal. One thing, right here is, - no big thing, but you might zero NOUN 26. It's still loaded, left over from the EMP used in the P2 3 yesterday.
|SC|Okay. Thank you much.
|SC|Gordy, this is the LMP, how do you read?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Say. When I was switching batteries I noticed switching from low to high-taps that there were some reverse current indications. Sure that's nothing to be concerned about, you probably expected those. Right.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack. That's normal.
|SC|Righ t.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. From all indications on telemetry here in Mission Control, the crew at this time has closed the Lunar Module hatch and it should be reinstalling the probe and drogue assemblies. And finally the Command Module hatch, thereby closing out the tunnel. Apollo 17 now 177, whoops would you believe our space digital have gone back to Earth reference momentarily. At any rate the spacecraft is 177 966 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 2652 feet per second in - with reference to the Earth. And as soon as the space digital display goes back to the Moon reference, we'll read those numbers off. We're waiting for the call from the call crew that they have completed stowing or installing the probe and drogue assembly in closing out the tunnel. At 61:51 standing by this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 13:24 GET 61:51 257/1

|AMERICA|Okay, stand by 1. Okay, we'll get that in a minute, Gordon.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordo, the charge should be terminated on bat B.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|And 7 alpha is still .6.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordie, I'm looking around, but I can't figure out what that master alarm is? I didn't see any 02 high flow and I didn't see any lights and we'did get it down in the LEB.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene.
|AMERICA|And there it is again.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|And again.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Okay, I saw SPS pressure blink on that one.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Yes, Gordie, keeps triggering continually on SPS pressure.
|AMERICA|Yes, I can reset it and a minute later she's coming up with a blink on SPS pressure.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene. We think it's the, well, we're sure that it's the oxidizer pressure, it's right on the trip limit, we're almost certain it's due to helium absorption.
|AMERICA|Yes, we're reading 155 right now.
|CAPCOM|Ro g e r.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordie. We got the SPS pressure light on steady now.
|CAPCOM|Roger,
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. If you give us ACCEPT, we 11 give you a new state vector. There's not much wrong with the one you've got but we're just going to teek it up.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordie, you've got it.
|CAPCOM|One other question, do you have the LM closed up, now. We're seeing some heater currents that are a little higher, indicating maybe the lights still on, we're just trying to understand where the LM is at the present time.
|AMERICA|Okay, I just closed the hatch, just about the time you started talking there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll take a look at the temps now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 13:49 GET 62:16 MC-258/1
062:16:00|CAPCOM|America, it's your computer and we'did th e VE RB 6 6.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Hey, Gordo, what's the trend in thinking on that SPS light, to leave it lit or to bump the pressure up?
|CAPCOM|Ed Mitchell must be at work. Because we were just talking about that subject. I'll call you when - with a final decision.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. And Ron has put - has closed LM hatch, put the drogue in and he put the probe in and he's putting the CSM hatch in as a one-man exercise suited. So, he's doing the whole thing and he's still in his suit. Our suits are s t owed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, we got one question here, that - just waiting for a convenient time to ask, and I was wondering is with reference to the wakeup problems we had this morning. If you clearify just exactly why Ron didn't hear our crew-alert master alarm, you know exactly why?
|AMERICA|Well, it's not the Seconal. As much as I hate to admit it, the power audio tone was off (chuckle) in my headset.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We kind a suspected that - -
|AMERICA|So, - Okay, that lets you rest a little bit easier. And just to prevent something like that from happening again, or if it should happen again, what we'll do we'll hook up the tone-booster, which we'didn't have hooked up last night.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And we concur positive.
|AMERICA|Yeah. I woke up and I saw that light there and I thought gee whiz, I just got it in time until I tried to push out that caution and warning master alarm. And worked the end of my finger.
|CAPCOM|(Laughter)
|AMERICA|I was also in a sleep restraint and upside down was a zipper in the back and I had a little problem in getting my hands up to start with also.
|CAPCOM|Ro g .
|AMERICA|Hey Houston, cabin repress is back to both now. I mean emergency cabin repress.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, if you don't have any objections, we'd like to go ahead and secure the high-gain and go on a PTC while Ron's doffing his PGA.
|CAPCOM|Let me check and see if we have any.
|CAPCOM|Sounds good to us. Go ahead and - per flight plan and spin it up.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.

|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy. You want to leave the high-gain until you call?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Jack this is a good attitude to go OMNI BRAVO and you can1go ahead and secure the high-gain.
|SC|Okay.

062:43:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. The rates look good,you're GO for spin up.
|AMERICA|Okay, great Gordo, we're GO for spin up. We've got a show in here that very few men have ever seen, and that's the CMP trying to get out of his suit by himself.
|CAPCOM|Wish I was there to watch.
|AMERICA|It really is a story to behold. Needless to say, we're both very impressed.
|CAPCOM|I can tell.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Use BD ROLL for spin up.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston. This is the LMP on bio med. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. Let's take a spot check here.
|CAPCOM|America, D2 ROLL is not on, you need the delta roll checked.
|AMERICA|Yes, I'm still working on it, Gordo. I was just deciding whether it's minus or plus, but I guess we'd better stay minus as per flight plan.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|We're on our way.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the LMP DKG and ZPN look good, and on the SPS light, we recommend not doing anything with the system. We want you to go to acknowledge so the — to get the light out of your eyes, and then just fly there and acknowledge indication of warning.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordie. We're in acknowledge, and I presume, probably after LOI, we'll be able to go back to normal, right?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|AMERICA|Is that an abnormal amount of helium injection or do you think that's about right?
|CAPCOM|It's absorption, and that's normal.
|AMERICA|Hello, Houston. You read?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear.
|AMERICA|Okay, now that we got another look at you Gordie, it looks like Houston might be right on the fringe of either being clear or clear, the entire Gulf is pretty nice. Florida looks pretty clear and Mexico looks pretty clear. There's a big air mass of clouds that looks like it picks up somewhere around the coast at Houston and heads on up north and then covers most of the midwest and the east from about the middle of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia on north. It's clear enough now to even see the coral reefs down off of Florida. And it looks like west Texas is probably also pretty clear, at least in a run from east to west. We -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 14:16 GET 62:43 259/2
|AMERICA|Can see Baja, and on up the coast of California up north.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds like the whole crew is turning into weathermen.
|AMERICA|It's one of the better views we've had of the states, I think, even though we're quite a ways out.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Looks like your sub spacecraft point is just about at Peru right now.
|AMERICA|Yes, it looks like we're looking straight down in the center of South America, pretty close to what you're saying. Gordie, you want to bring us up to date briefly on how you plan to handle this time update again?
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll do that. But let me practice before I start here, just a minute.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm primarily interested in those parts of the flight plan which we're going to eliminate.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just one second. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 14:29 GET 62:57 MC-260/1
|CAPCOM|Geno, I'll read you the PAO release, they summed up pretty well, and I'll just use their words here. The time has been made up in two increments. The first one of 1 hour and 45 minutes in the flight plan. The crew activities were jumped ahead by 1 hour and they essentially began doing those , things that were called for 1 hour later in the flight plan. They will again jump ahead 1 hour and 40 minutes and that will occur in 65 hours. By that time they will have completed all those activities required up thru 67 hours 40 minutes in the flight plan. Or in other words, they will have completed all the activities required to get them into Lunar Orbit 2 hours 40 minutes early and in order to make the clock then agree with where the crew will be in the flight plan we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. This clock update, which can be likened to going on day light savings time, only 2 hours and 40 minutes were in the change instead of one hour of change as we'do on daylight savings time will occur at 65 hoUrs when the crew will have completed all of those flight plan activities up thru 67 hours and 40 minutes. This simply involves setting our clock to 65 hours in the control center and aboard the spacecraft at 65 hours moving them ahead to 67 hours and 40 minutes. Then by any further changes in the mission timeline from that point on the elapsed time clock which are used as a cue to flight plan activities should agree with the flight plan in events that in the flight plan a call out for a certain time will have been at that time on the elapsed time clocks in mission control and aboard the spacecraft. This is a convenience factor.
|SC|You're lucky we're going to lose an OMNI.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I'll hold on there for the rest.
|SC|Gordy, never mind, I think I got the gest of i t .
|SC|Did you give up Gordy?
|CAPCOM|Okay. What we're really going to do really is simple. At 65 hours we're going to do the update of 2 hours and 40 minutes. And the procedures are shown in the flight plan at 67:35. There just happens to be really no, no activities we have to reschedule in the intervening time. So, after the update is complete, we'll be right on the flight plan, both time-wise and activity-wise. Over.
|SC|Okay. We're looking at it.
|SC|And I have to squeeze my shave In somewhere else, I guess.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Gene, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Hey, you got a break - cast the time vote which is the best description the water-bag or the cloth one.
|SC|Oh yeah, now I remember.
|SC|We got a little - give a little credit on this last one, I guess to Public Affairs. Because I don't think Gordo could have thought that one up all by himself.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 14:29 GET 62:57 MC-260/2
062:57:00|SC|Very diplomatic.
|SC|Considering I was trying to do Charlie's technique step by step, I guess I got to give him little bit more credit from the gymnastic point of view.
|SC|That sounded like one of Gordy's aircraft s chedules.
|SC|Amen.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 63 hours 9 minutes.
|SC|They were putting another Saturn V out on the p ad.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we lost all of that due to the antenna switch, say1it again.
|CAPCOM|Jack we missed your last transmission.
|SC|Gordy, you listening.- -
|CAPCOM|Due to the antenna switch. SG1You say you got it or you're getting it.
|CAPCOM|No we missed it  Okay, I said you can look right down at the Cape area, that's the Cape that we know, in Florida and it's little disheartening because the last time I was up here looking back from this angle we were moving another Saturn V for another Moon trip out on the pad already. I guess they're working pretty feverishly out there on the - -
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 63 hours 11 minutes ground elapsed time. Charlie Duke was on the spacecraft's communicators console for a while there, discussing the clock update description that had been read up earlier by Gordo Fullerton asking for a judgement on the part of the crew as to whether that description was better than - -^
|SC|Jack, I think Gene was probably right. You got some, probably scattered cloud weather, but not very far away from you there's a pretty heavy mass of clouds. It may be the forerunner of that dry cold front you were talking about yesterday, which I can see stretching over Into Synora, but where it hits the state side, you've got quite a mass of clouds associated with it and looks like they're moving in your direction.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack thanks for the warning.
|SC|Clear behind us in Arizona to Mexico and maybe Southern Colorado. It looks like there may be another front stretching, or maybe it hits Northern Arizona and Utah and up through Northern Colorado, and on in to Canada. Turning Northeast.
|CAPCOM|You're calling it right on Jack, I'm looking at the surface chart and that's about what we see.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 14:46 CST 63:13 GET MC261/1
063:13:00|CHALLENGER|Looks like a low might be developing on that one - a wave up in Northern Colorado and - although the clouds are a little hard to read.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|And that was lunar module pilot, Jack S chmi 11.
|CHALLENGER|Up our zero page point, about 20 degrees west of Bolivia, are some - are zero - zero page point and it is quite a bit brighter than yesterday and looks as if and more general as if maybe the seas have picked up in that region a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|Some more real-time weather reporting.
|CHALLENGER|Features is developed - as I see - developed in the South East Pacific just north of the Ross Sea and that is a very striking mushroom pattern on a very large scale. It has north-south cloud streaming streamers from the Ross Sea and when it gets up about the lattitude of Tierra Del Fuego but quite a bit west of that land it branches out to the east and west in a large mushroom pattern. It looks like the top of that mushroom may be a curved cold front that's pushing it's way up Into the southeast Pacific. It currently - the eastern edge of that front is probably 10 degrees longitude from Tierra Del Fuego and it looks like that land is in southern Chili and picking up high clouds, probably associated with that front's movement.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|I'll get some shots of that next time around. That's a spectacular pattern. You almost get the feeling that the cold air mass moving out of Anartica streams for a while north-south and then it picks the cloud patterns change and it starts to migrate - the winds start to change from east to west. Maybe that's where it encounters the jet stream.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Going through an antenna switch at the present time.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, I have a couple of miscellaneous items here.
|AMERICA|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like you to disable B2 and D2 just for a drill.
|SC|Oh, thank you Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Also, the she tank looks exactly nominal as far as the rise rate goes to us.
|SC|Can't argue with that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 14:46 GET 63:13 261/2
063:13:00|CAPCOM|And to summarize your film by your situa tion have three magazines KK LL and MM budgeted for the scheduled photos such that they have only 5 19 and 1 respectively frames left over after you've done all the schedules pictures. And november november we think has just has nine frames remaining now. The two nonscheduled magazines are 00 and PP 160 frames each. Those are the ones provided for optional use. We have 44 additional frames scheduled out of November November scheduled during lunar orbit. There is only 9 left in it now so we'd like to save at least 60 frames out of either oscar oscar or pappa pappa the two optional magazines to cover the scheduled frames. Guess what we're saying is that there is no problem we've still got plenty of film, but you will have to use some of your optional mags for scheduled pictures 60 frames is what we want to save.
|SC|Okay, mighty fine Gordo plan on oscar oscar for that magazine.

Distance 180 309 nautical miles, velocity relative to Earth 2593 feet per second. A few moments ago the lunar module pilot, Jack Schmitt, who is a professional geologist, put on his hat as an amateur meteorologist and described some of the global weather systems visible from their vantage point out beyond 180 000 miles from Earth. Still up live and standing by at 63:24 GET this is Apollo Control.
|SC|Gordy, this is Jack.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack.
|SC|I, Cal Tech will never forgive me, I'm little hesitant on my elementary optics, but I just put Ron's polorizing filter in front of the monocular looking at the Earth and rotate 90 degrees and from max to min in terms of brightness, there's a remarkable change. I suspect that means that the Earth is polorizing light enough to see it. The main thing that happens is that the oceans get considerably darker when I rotate the filter towards the dark position anyway. The continents don't seem to show any obvious change but the oceans and the geoface point darken, oh I would guess by a factor of 2 in brightness, maybe that an extreme, but I think it's that.
|CAPCOM|Ah, Jack, I was just trying to think of a reason, is it uniform change over all ocean areas or is it more of a change in some areas than others?
|SC|Well, I'd say that the sub-solar point shows the greatest change, but you can still - the geoface point shows the greatest change. But all the oceans get darker.
|CAPCOM|Very interesting. We are just about to switch OMNI.

|CAPCOM|Okay. The Cowboy-Redskin game just got started. It's now 7-0, Cowboys. They scored the first time they got their hands on the ball.
|SC|Okay, I think we got most of that. It hap pened again, though. Did you say it was 7-0 Cowboys?
|CAPCOM|That's what I said. They scored the first time they got the ball. It's -- the game's just about 5 minutes old.
|SC|Outstanding. I thought this was Saturday. Isn't today Saturday?
|CAPCOM|It is, but college is all through, so the pros are playing on Saturday now.

|SC|Nosiree. Go get 'em Cowboys.
|SC|Houston,17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|Okay, Gordo. My apologies on the CMD's in suit drinking bag. There was, in fact, water in it. However, somehow, when we put the suit on the water bag had gotten turned sideways, I guess is the way they explain it. It got turned sideways such that the suction tube was crimped sideways. And, as a result, there is no way that you could get any water to go through the tube.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You're talking about the problem we had there just before launch, right?
|SC|That's affirmative — prelaunch. Okay, and for your information, the PTC looks good it ought to, hold.

|SC|Gordy I, this is Jack, I just tried the red filter on the front of the monocular, and about the only major thing I noticed was that the cloud patterns over the land masses seemed to be enhanced. The contrast between cloud and land, particularly green land, is enhanced. Otherwise, all it does is make the Earth look a little red.

064:13:00|SC|Houston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack.
|SC|Yeah, about this ice pack in the Ross Sea the, as I remember a couple days ago, there were two clear areas, triangular in shape and quite elongate, that were projecting out into the sea from the intermost part of the bay or the, from the continent. Today those are not apparent or at least the first look I made. And it looks like there is an elongate more irregular clear area that is roughly parallel to the Antarctic coast line within the sea itself. We'll check that a little more closely and see if that's right.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Seems like kind of a quick change for something like ice. Doesn't it?
|SC|Yeah, and that's what bothers me. That's why I wonder if I'm not being fooled by cloud patterns or something.
|CAPCOM|I'm looking at a satellite picture here which I guess is around 12 hours old though, but over to the east of Australia, maybe about a continent width east of Australia there is really striking long frontal system, striking because it's so long and so straight, sort of west northwest extending west, northwest and east, southeast turning. Can you see that?
|SC|Gordo, are you there?
|CAPCOM|Yes, sir, right here.
|SC|Okay, now. Jack and I may be talking about two different frontal systems or patterns; but the one I think you might be referring to is the one I referred to yesterday as a ruffled parrot beak, actually two of them tied together one starting up probably southeast of Australia and then heading down with a long arcing frontal system to another clockwise rotational parrot's cone I should say, down around near the tip of South America between it and Antarctica. There is one strong tributary front heading up to the north northwest from the western side of this big arctic frontal mass. And I think that's probably what you're referring to, I'm not not sure, I can't quite see, Australia coming up over the horizon yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I, my picture cuts off right about oh, two-thirds of the way south in Australia, that latitude, so, most likely we're talking about the same thing; but I1. can't verify the southern part of it.
|SC|There is some tremendous - western side of that curve front, is a tremendous clockwise rotational air mass, it must cover hundreds of square miles. The one down near the continent of Antarctica, down there, near the tip of South America, seemed to be squashed slightly as if there is possibly some squashing or effect coming off the South Pole area near Antarctica. I think, if I turn around and look at it the way Jack was looking at it, it's a cap of a mushroom. Only instead of simply curving in underneath the cap it has clockwise rotations on both sides as it curves unde r.

|CAPCOM|Okay, 15 3.
|SC|Gordy, where did you say your HES satellite picture left off to the west.
|CAPCOM|Okay, to the west it goes clear on over to Africa, but to the south it cuts off about 30 south, or not quite all of Australia.
|SC|Okay. Yes. That mushroom pattern we've been talking about, on either end, either end of the cap, the mushroom points north. Is a major cyclone circulation system. And also taking, moving, in one case or trending in one case to the northwest and the other to the northeast, there are linear cloud patterns. Gives it a very symmetrical and a striking appearance. I hope it shows on those pictures.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it doesn't show on the one I got. Maybe a later version will have that one. Because it's cut off on this one .

This tape is around the edges of each of those three areas to help seal out light leaks. You haven't seen it before. Leave the tape on there. Don't pull it off. Over.

|CAPCOM|And 17, we got that fly by pad now if your still ready we're ready.
|SC|Okay, is this a full pad or just a change to the other one.
|CAPCOM|Just a change Jack it's a change to NOUN 83 the GET I and the change to the bottom line the GET 05 g just two ch ang es.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Jack, if you'll just add 2 hours and 40 , mintues to each one of them that's it. The GETI is 081 54 43 49 . The GET of 05 g 156 04 03. Jack I guess I read 81 I was looking at the old pad it's 83 083 on the GET I.
|SC|Your too fast for me I was just going to chew you out.
|CAPCOM|Sorry about that Jack I got it around the room.
|SC|083 (laughter) 083 54 43 49 156 04 03.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Bob we got all of our clocks set onbo ard.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|SC|What was the exact amount of that update ti me ?
|CAPCOM|2 hours and 40 minutes 2 plus 40.
|SC|Okay, 2 plus 40 exactly thank you.
|SC|Okay, Bob we're going to work up an appetite with the ALFMED today.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, Bob maybe a little premature, but I don't think so, but I think there was some good thinking into that update looking at the flight plan up until now, and where we go from here. I don't think we overlooked a th in g.
|CAPCOM|Roger, like I said the other night we gave Tommy a gold star on that one.
|SC|Except I think he and Rita got in cahoots.
|CAPCOM|A little soon for supper, huh?
|SC|Yeah, we just finished lunch andit's about time to eat again.
|CAPCOM|That's known as the simulator step ahead.
|SC|Can you give us our distance from the Earth ?
|CAPCOM|Roger, stand by.
|SC|Are we about 5 000 miles closer now?

|CAPCOM|Normally, yes but this one didn't work that way.
|CAPCOM|Jack, your at 183 000 miles. It's really amazing how time flys when your interested in your work isn't it ?
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston. Did you read my last call with the distance?
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 68 hours 1 minute. Apollo 17 is 183 211 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity is 20521 feet per second. The spacecraft communicator now is Bob Overmyer. Stu Roosa the backup command module pilot for Apollo 17 is also at the capcom console with Overmyer.

068:03:00|SC|H ouston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead 17.
|SC|Okay, Bob, we're getting ready for the ALFMED. I just took red filter and a blue filter picture, two pictures on frame 41 now, with a 35 millimeter. Pictures of the Earth and I took them one stop smaller, that is more open than the light meter said, hoping to compensate for the small Earth. The Earth just barely fills the most inner, the innermost circle of the spot meter. Also, there's a very strong band of cloud, shaped sort of like a narrow fir tree with a base about 20 degrees of longitude west of Baha, California that extends up, I believe, into the vicinity of Hawaii, and the top terminates in a very strong northern cyclone pattern.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Was your magazine Sierra, Sierra?
|SC|That's affirmed. Sierra, Sierra.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. And you say that cloud is right that cloud area is right near Baha, California? I've got a picture of it here in front of me, from one of the satellites.
|SC|No, it's about 20 degrees west, longitude degrees west of that.
|CAPCOM|Yes. Okay, we've got it on the spot here.
|SC|And maybe even more than that. Okay, maybe even more than that. It's, it might be as much as 40 degrees west and actually Hawaii may be on the west side of that. It's a little hard to tell. It's close enough to the LM that it's hard to say.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. I think I've got it on our map here. It shows a pretty heavy dense cloud area right now in that area you're talking about.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 68 hours 7 minutes. ALFMED is Apollo Light Flash Moving
|SC|For the ALFMED, CDR will be in the left seat, CMP will be in the center seat with the ALFMED. For our reporting when we get the VOX, we'll just call out our first names to shorten it and the comments following. And Jack will be recording.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We'll be listening.
|PAO|That's the Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector, associated with the visual light flash phenomenon that most crews have reported on past missions, seeing points of light in their eyes, when their eyes were closed. There are a couple of theories proposed on the origin of the flashes. One is that they are caused by cosmic rays. The other is that they are high energy atomic particles which enter the eyeball or ionize upon collision with retina or cerebral cortex. The ALFMED is an emulsion plate device that Ron Evans will wear. It will cover the front and sides of his head and will provide information on time, strength and path of particles penetrating the emulsion plates. The other two crewmen will wear eye shields. This test will last for approximately an hour. And the data on the, recorded by the ALFMED device will be correlated with the crewmen's verbal reports on flash observations.

068:11:00|SC|Okay, wait a minute. Houston, how do you read on VOX with the light weight heatset?
|CAPCOM|' Read you loud and clear, Ron.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Yes. Wait a minute. Let me get this little box set to go here, first.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Yes. Okay, utility power is off. Yes power switch is off. Okay, it's connected now. Okay, utility power is on. Okay. Let me get strapped in here somehow. I'll float all over. Okay, let's see. Uh huh, I can. Okay, my blindfold's going on now. Okay, sounds like big (garble). Okay, somebody will have to help me put this thing on. Just kind of like so. Yes. It goes around the old (garble).
|SC|You want us to operate now?
|SC|No, just turn it down a little bit. Go to oper ate while you're taking the pictures there.
|SC|Hello, Houston. CDR put his blindfold on at 68:18.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SC|And how do you read me in VOX Bob. This i s Gene .
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, Gene.
|SC|Okay, I'm conducting the experiment. And the frame Sierra, Sierra is now at 45. I got two shots. Two from the side, and two from the bottom.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Copy.
|SC|Hey, looks like a countdown for ready to go J ack .
|SC|Hey, Bob, does it make any difference if your eyes are opened or closed?
|CAPCOM|It may be a personal thing, Gene. I, this is Stu, I had to have my eyes closed, but give it either way.
|SC|Okay, thank you.
|SC|Okay, we'll count down to start. 3, 2, 1, mark it. It's buzzing.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 17:18 GET 68:24 272/1
068:24:00|SC|Change it. The other side is not very good.
|SC|Mark, Gene I've got a series of random lines which do not appear to be the width of my field of view that are moving like a flashing horizon with thunderstorms on the horizon. Their dimly flashing and their moving across the eye from left to right and from top to bottom individually. Both eyes. It's stopped now.
|SC|Mark, this is Gene again going from the upper left to the bottom right lines of the same sort of thing, dimly lit flashing horizon type flashes. But their linear. Their linear and they tend to come from either the upper left or the upper right and work their way downward. Now they've stopped. Both eyes.
|SC|Mark, Gene again. Both eyes this time the same flashes on the horizon, but they don't seem to be moving out of both eyes. Tend to be up at the tops of both eyes. Just rapid sequential lightening like flashes. They've s t op pe d.
|SC|Mark, Gene again. Similar type of flashes they don't seem to be moving, but their coming from the right of the right eye and from the upper left of the right eye. And I can actually see an outline of a curved horizon and the flashes are coming out from behind it. They've stopped.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 68 hours 30 minutes. Distance from Earth 183 910 nautical miles.
|SC|And I see peripherally out of my right eye. I cannot see these flashes, but I can see peripherally the right hand and upper right hand side of my right eye being lit up.
|PAO|Distance 183 920 nautical miles velocity 2 504 feet per second.
|SC|Pardon? this last one? They were peri pherally I couldn't see them all I know is that there was some light out peripherally out but a flashing glow. Oh man, there is a good one the left eye right in the middle it's almost a purple flash. It's still going right in the middle of my eye and it's coming out from behind a horizon that is almost. It starts out as a semicircle and then folds in to a point like on a pencil, and then it disappears. That's the horizon and the light is flashing from behind it. It's gone.
|CAPCOM|Hey Gene, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, according to all our experts here the phenomena your describing is pretty much the phosphene effect sort of like when you rub your eyes or squint your
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 17:18 GET 68:24 272/2
068:24:00|CAPCOM|eyes too hard because the effect is lasting too long. The streaks or the flashes that we're looking for are very fast and they do not remain as a scene to your eye. And I guess the only thing we could say would be to maybe either relax your squint a little bit or to put the blindfolds on exceptionally tight. I know this sounds kind of screwy, but those are the words that we would like to say to you but the actual phenomena we're looking for will be a very short lived phenomena it will either be a flash or a very fast streak. Something along this —— we re not trying to load the data, but we feel your describing a different phenomena.
|SC|Bill we lost all that last conservation you better repeat it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, sorry about that and here I thought I had waxed so eloquently. But the effect you re describing is an effect that comes from rubbing your eyes or perhaps squinting too hard, but the effect we re looking for and I guess we're really not trying to load the data, but the effect that we're looking for is a very short lived phenomena and would not -
|SC|Mark, Ron, I got one in the right eye that's coming from going towards - very narrow streak.
|CAPCOM|And Gene our only words of wisdom are try to relax the eyes a little bit or if you have the blindfold on exceptionally tight you might work on that. But - I guess sort of relax and see if we can see the other phenomena.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 17:30 CST 68:36 GET MC273/1
068:36:00|SC|Mark, Ron, one about 12:00 in the right eye and looked like it was just a spot.
|SC|How about 15 seconds ago? It's so dim now I hardly noticed what it was.
|SC|Kinda started in the left eye and just a flash in the left eye and then a flash in the right eye, very dim. Going left, left to right.
|SC|Mark. Can't tell if it's right or left eye. Looks like it's almost between the two eyes. There's a mark in the one of the left eye. It's about right in the center. Spot, no streak or anything, just a spot. First spot seems to be between the two eyes. Upper half of the field of view.
|SC|Mark, Gene, straight from the upper right eye down to about the middle.
|SC|Mark, Ron, about 8:00, (garble) the diameter out, just a bright flash, it's the brightest flash I've seen yet. Left eye .
|SC|Just about a second or two after Ron said Mark, I saw a vertical bright line in the left side of the left eye, just flashed. It was the greatest intensity on the last one I had but, the brightness was there but it was kinda dull glow to it. It wasn't. A spot that you could really focus on.
|SC|Mark, Ron, left eye, about 9:30, half way .
|SC|Mark, Gene, left eye, very bright spot, left eye, left side about half way in towards the middle.
|SC|That was the brightest one I've seen and it was just a spot.
|SC|On the intensity of the last one I had was, oh, a fourth of the bright one I had before that. Spot, yes on the left eye.
|SC|Mark about 5 seconds ago, about 6:00 in the right eye. Mark, right between the two eyes seemed like. Both s pot s.
|SC|Mark, Gene, a sharp line from the center of the left eye to the upper left hand, upper left hand side.
|SC|Mark, Gene it's a very short, very short line upper left hand of left eye going towards the right.

|SC|Mark, Gene, upper right eye, tangential to my eye, just a very short line. Moving -
|SC|Mark, Ron, oh, a fourth of diameter out in the right eye. Light spot seemed like it was coming in. I could see the spot and then the streak, It went from that point kind of in, or up, I guess.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 17 : 30 CST 68:36 GET MC273/2
068:36:00|SC|Mark, Gene, a dull flash in the bottom in side corner of the right eye.
|SC|Mark, Ron. Go ahead, Gene.
|SC|Okay. Correction, Gene. That was on the left eye, that last one?
|SC|The last ones, for Ron, was at 10:00 and three-fourth of the diameter out, just a, oh, well it was only about an eighth of an inch in diameter, right eye.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 GET 69:02 CST 17:55 MC274/1
069:02:00|SC|Mark Gene. Mark again, a flash. The first flash was in the left eye and the left side. It went vertically up and away. And following that was a flash in the identically same spot. It was a line flash up and away. On the left side of each eye and it went up in both cases, but they were split by about 2 seconds.
|SC|Mark Ron. One fourth of the diameter out at 3 o'clock in the right eye. I mean a half a diameter. Half a radius, put it that way.
|SC|Mark Gene. A flash across the bottom of the right eye coming inward from left to right.
|SC|On the last one it looked like it was a
|SC|Mark Gene, just a spot flash in the bottom of the left eye.
|SC|This is Ron. My last one there was just a spot flash. No direction to it at all.
|SC|Ron mark. Mark, this is Ron. When I first said the word, it kind of looks like a, almost a sine wave transition from the corner and upper at 10 o'clock in the right eye to about 2 o'clock in the left eye. Right between the two of them. The sine wave with maybe two wiggles in it and it was about a fourth of an inch long. Going from right to left, yes. And going into the left at about 2 o'clock.
|SC|Turn that music higher.
|SC|Yes.
|SC|Mark Ron. Seems like I looked up and as I looked up, there was one in the left eye about 12 o'clock, just a flash. On the outer periphery.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 69 hours 15 minutes. Apollo 17's distance from Earth 184 987 nautical miles. Velocity 2477 feet per second.
|SC|Mark Ron. Looks to be down about 6:30, just a flash. Right eye. Mark Ron. Left eye, about 3:30 three quarters of the radius out. A very dim flash. About 3:30. Mark Ron. Left eye. Starting at 5 o'clock on the circumference going to 3 o'clock and about thrre quarter diameter, three quarter radius, I mean. Just a straight line. Did I say left eye? I guess I meant it. Okay, let's see. (garble) It appears the motor quit. Okay.
|SC|Isthatit?
|SC|Yes, I'll give it to Gene.

069:21:00|SC|Okay, you want to take a picture of the first one? Okay, stand by 3, 2, 1 mark it, power's on yaw.
|SC|Say, Bob or Stu.
|CAPCOM|Roger, go ahead.
|SC|Okay to add to today. Not last night, but I guess the first night I was in bed I definitely saw some of these. Because I had a hard time going to bed to start with I saw some of the same peripheral horizon type things you said were not the type of data you were looking for, but I also saw some sets of the streaks and probably the one most imposing thing that I remember was - and the last one I remember before falling alseep was the fact that there was a very bright spot that flashed right between my eyes like a very bright headlight like a train coming at you only with a flash. It's difficult probably to estimate the frequency of any of those because I was in a sort of a sleep hazy mode.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|But then as today I saw some that flashed and lit up the horizon and some that lit up peripherally and I guess as you say that's different kind of data, but I did see them there and they impressed me.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got all that Gene.
|SC|Okay, and it might be interesting to know I've never seen it before today.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Gene we appreciate all the data we were just trying to make the data fit the curve you know the old trick,
|SC|Okay, I just wanted you to - just tell old Mike we saw them that's all,
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|I will say one thing, though, no ques tion in my mind but that they're there. Last trip I took I guess I just wasn't looking for them or paying any attention to them. Maybe they were there and I ignored them because of other things. But they were there.
|SC|Okay, all you flash bugs down there - flash bulbs I guess is the word frame 50 I just took four pictures to show two on the side and two on the bottom to show the position of the ALFMED and one of them of each set was focused on the ALFMED the others were focused — the other set was focused on the strutts.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|And when you don't have anything else to do why don't you have somebody predict where the S-IVB is I think I've got her spotted behind us and above us with respect to the Earth and our travel from it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 18:15 GET 69 :21 275/2
000:21:00|CAPCOM|Item just went out and shot himself, but we'll get working on it.
|SC|Oh, don't worry about it shoot. I thought you guys might have an idea off the cuff there.
|CAPCOM|No what's humorous in this Jack is they have really been working on that S-IVB impact point. It's been a real difficult problem for them so far.
|SC|I'll tell you, I bet you Ron could give a star sighting on it. I looked at it through the monocular and sure looks like the S-IVB.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we're not doubting you at all we could probably start cranking it right now.
|CAPCOM|Jack are you all stowing the ALFMED now or are you done?
|SC|What's that, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Are you all done with the ALFMED now, Ron?
|SC|Yes, I've got to get it to, get the plate moved back down there yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|SC|Get the blindfold off first so I can see what I'm doing.
|CAPCOM|Roger, I just want you to know we've got a real long update coming up to you here on the LOI abort charts and it's probably going to be a difficult read up. And your the most familiar with the charts you probably would want to take them. But whenever you want to take them they are on charts on page 3-81, 3-82 and then the cue card for LOI limits. Whenever you want to take them it will be a lengthy one.
|SC|Stand by, Bob let us get squared away from the ALFMED then we will get going on that.
|CAPCOM|No, 1 don't want to hurry you, Ron. I just want you to get yourself comfortable and be ready to take them whenever you want them. It's going to be a lengthy time, though.
|SC|Okay. Hey Bob, I'm looking at what Jack was talking about and it's definitely not a partical that's nearby because there is another one I can look at and get a three dimensional comparison with. It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing. It's way out in the distance as I say because there are particles that are close by and it's obviously not one of those. It's apparently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost on time and as we look back at the Earth it's up at about 11:00 about - oh, maybe 10 or 12 Earth diameters I don't know if that does you any good, but there is something out there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 18:15 GET 69:21 275/3
069:21:00|CAPCOM|Rog, we'don't doubt it Gene and we might work out a set of fimble angles or something here maybe we can get a look at it through the optics.
|SC|Okay. And I just want to emphasize that's it definitely not one of these particles that tends to look like a star out there something physical in the distance.
|SC|(Laughter). (Garble). Yes, guess I am.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 18:24 CST 69:31 GET MC276/1
069:31:00|CAPCOM|Say, Gene, if you can call up a NOUN 20 so we know the spacecraft attitude and if you can reference the object you're looking at out of your window with respect to body axis and let us look at your — give us a mark somehow and give us your NOUN 20, we can try to get a tie in and start locating the biomed for you.
|SC|Okay, I'm looking at it out the center window, the hatch window, and I'll give you a hack when it crosses the X, X axis at the center window and I guess it's up maybe 45 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Okay, give us a hack and we're copying your NOUN 20 right now.
|SC|Okay, Jack said, pitched up about 30 degrees but ah, yeah, he agreed. It's 45.degrees pitched up and I'll give hack when it crosses the XX axis.
|SC|Okay mark it, it just crossed through the
|CAPCOM|Mark, we got it.
|SC|Let's call it the XZ plane in the space craft .
|SC|One unique thing about it, Bob, is that it got 2 flashes as it comes around in, in rhythmic fashion, you get a very bright flash and then you get a dull flash. And then it'll come around with a bright flash and then a dull flash. That's the SLA end of the S-IVB and then the engine bell, Gene.
|SC|The Commander doesn't think that I can see the engine bell on that thing, Frank.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Is that with the binoculars you're looking at?
|SC|He couldn't see the engine bell if he had ten binoculars.
|SC|Okay, I've got the cable restrung now.
|CAPCOM|Say again, Ron.
|SC|And ah, Gene, (garbled).
|SC|Bob, couple of revolutions ago when I was looking at it, I had a much brighter view and I believe I was looking at it broad side. It looks to me like it may be flashing more or less in (garbled) not as bright, although it's getting brighter. But, it's not as bright now as it was a while ago.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|In fact we've been noticing that I think for about 24 hours or so. I just hadn't put it together as maybe being the S-IVB. I thought it was just some other particle out there.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.

069:31:00|SC|Hey, Robert, what's the final Cowboy score?
|CAPCOM|Okay, just an update that the Cowboys won it, 34 to 24. And by winning it they wrap up the wild card slot in the NFC and so both Washington and Dallas will be in the playo f fs.
|SC|Sounds good.
|SC|Bob, that line of clouds I called a fir tree pattern, that swings up towards Hawaii, Hawaii if you will, has, also has a mushroom pattern on the top. It has the appearance as if two major air masses; one going from west to east and the other from east to west have converged along that line and the joint movement of air at the interface being south to north. And up in the area of Hawaii, I think, it tends to mushroom so the pattern then goes back to a flow from west to east on the east side and from east to west on the west s i de .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|In a little while we'll probably get a pretty good look of a - what looks like a very concentrated intense storm that I think, is just, just east (garbled)
|SC|(garble) and then we'll put them, once we get update a little bit.

|SC|Houston, 17. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack. Read you loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, Bob you want to update the LOI card and Flight1Plan 382 and 381, is that right?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Which one do you want to start on?
|CAPCOM|I would say 381 is the most difficult one to s tar t on .
|SC|Okay, in that case, why don't you start on the board, on the cue card?
|CAPCOM|Okay. We can start on the cue card. Your druthers.
|SC|Yes. Go ahead. I'm ready.
|CAPCOM|Okay, on the LOI limits, the V go column, let's go right down the V go column, I think that would be the easiest way to do it. Where it says V go 2980, change that to 2986.
|SC|Why don't you just keep going?
|CAPCOM|Okay, the next one going straight down the line, 2721, 2521, and 2316. That's all the ch anges on the V go line.
|SC|Okay, and all those changes were in mode one ?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay, I got 2986, 2721, 2521, 2316.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Now, under the burn time column, the first one opposite the 2986, the burn time remains the same. Do not change that one. The next one chances 0 plus 401v
|SC|Which one is that Bob? I missed you.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Where it says 0 plus 28, change that to 0 plus 40.
|SC|Okay, press on, threw them all out.
|CAPCOM|Change the 0 plus 53 one to 1 plus 10. Change the 1 plus 31 to the number 1 plus 40. Over.
|SC|Okay, I got, in order, burn time, 0 and then 0 plus 40, 1 plus 10, 1 plus 40.
|CAPCOM|Roger. V measured column, the first one, the zero does not change. The next one, in this order: 265 465 and 6 70. Over.
|SC|Okay, I got 0, 265, 465, and 670.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Gene. That's the changes to the LOI limit cue card.

|CAPCOM|Roger. We felt that wasn't, that is correct. To be technically correct it should be 2986 at that last one.
|SC|Okay, I guess we're coming in just a skosh hotter, huh?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CAPCOM|You'll see from the curves that we going to have to update, that you're a lot closer to the free return trajectory.
|SC|Okay, why don't you go ahead on 381?
|CAPCOM|Okay, this is the tough one. The first thing we're going to do is prod a couple or three points here in the Mode 1 2 hour, the Mode 1 2 hour line changes also. So you might want to draw a line at a LOI Delta V DBM of 265 , 265 and draw that straight up the curve. That'll be the no, the new
|SC|LOI Delta V magnitude DBM of 265, huh?
|CAPCOM|Roger. That will be the crossover point to the Mode 1 2 hour to the Mode 1 30 minute.

069:48:00|SC|Bob, are you there?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, Bob, I've got two 65 vertical lines drawn and I expect I can extend the MODE 12 hour abort to that limit.
|CAPCOM|That is affirmative, Gene.
|CAPCOM|Now you're going to have a new curve so don't bother to draw on the old curve. We're going to give you three points to plot and draw a straight line between 'em that will create a new curve.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. The first one is at, the point is defined with a DELTA VM zero and abort DELTA B of 1525, 15 25.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|The second point is defined by a DELTA VM of 1 5 0 an abort DELTA V of 1 8 1 0. Over.
|SC|Bob, that last 1810.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay. Gotit.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and the last point is defined by DELTA VM of 2 6 5 and abort DELTA V of 2 10 5.
|CAPCOM|The curve defined by those three points will be your LOI plus 2 hours abort DELTA V.
|SC|Okay, that last point is just the DPS available curve with 2 6 5.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay, it's drawn in.
|CAPCOM|Okay, now we got a curve one.
|SC|---gues s at 2 .
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|I'm sorry I cut you out. Did you have some thing else you want on that?
|SC|No, it's good. I curved it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Curve 1 is two points defining it. The first one is DELTA VM of 2 6 5 abort DELTA V of 1 8 5 5.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And the second one is a DELTA VM of 4 0 0 abort DELTA V of 2 0 6 5.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Okay, those two points form the curved one of the MODE 1 30-minute.
|SC|Okay, I got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay now, curve 2 has three points defining it. The first point is identical with the end point of curve 1. It's 4 0 0 on the DELTA VM and 2 0 6 5 on the abort DELTA V.
|SC|Go ahead.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 18:41 CST 69:48 GET MC278/2
069:48:00|CAPCOM|Okay, the second point is 5 3 0 for the DVM and 2 2 415 for the abort DELTA V.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And the last point is DVM of 6 7 0 and a DELTA V, abort DELTA V of 2 4 7 5.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Okay, and if you draw a line up the page at the DVM of16 70 . That is the end of the MODE 1 30-minute and everthing1to the right of that you are in MODE 2.

|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 18:52 GET 69:59 MC279/1
069:59:00|SC|Hello, Houston. Are you reading yet?
|CAPCOM|Roger, go ahead.
|SC|Okay, Bob, curve looks good. I just checked the dipback crossover on the dips available, and it comes out with what you gave me on the card, about 2521.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And, just one minor point. Across the top on the block you began you can bias all those numbers -add a six to every one of them across the top to be technically corre ct.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|The next reading we have on that -
|SC|(Garble) correct, I could have done that be fore I -- before I plotted the curve, but that's good. We understand, and we got it down.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the next thing I've got is that whole update column in the little block there is all updated, and we probably ought to get a readback on all these numbers, Gene. I can give it to you right like a regular pad just from the right down to the top to the bottom, and then read it back to me. I think that'll be the best way, don't you?
|SC|Okay. Ron's going to go ahead and take them, and we'll double check them, and he'll read them back.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, just go ahead and start at the top and go down.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I'm starting at LOI ignition time. 885426.81Pitch is minus 43, yaw 112. GET abort ignition 892426.8, roll 217, pitch 6, yaw 25. Minus 42 on the pitch, 110 on the yaw. 216618. High gain angles again. Minus 75, yaw 250, GET abort ignition there 905426.8 1531719. Next time there is GET abort ignition for the LM at the A angles there -- 905426.8, roll, pitch and yaw angles, 202 ; 29; 330. Over. Okay, Bob, here we go on readback. Let's see them right down the line. 885426.8 minus 43112, 892426.8, 217625 minus 42 110 216618 minus 75250 905426.8, 1531719, 905426.8,1202, 29, 330. Over.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. Real good readback. On the next page, on page 382, the data there is exactly the same as the LOI limit cue card to changes. We can read it up to you individually, or you can take it from your cue cards, your choice.
|SC|No, we'll change it from the cue card.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Bob, since they won't let me write anything, I tried looking for the Moon near the Sun with the filters and could not see it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|You sure you're sending us to the right place ?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 18:52 GET 69:59 MC279/2
069:59:00|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Hey, I've got some information on that SIVB that you're looking at. The azimuth was within 1 degree of what you called when we checked out on your angles1.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Jack. Houston.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|This was for Jack and Gene. The trench has computed the SIVB location in reference to your body axis, and the azimuth was within 1 degree, very close, and the -we calculate it should have been out of that window at 62 degrees from the X-axis, and you reported 45 degrees, which is just a 17 degree error is real close there. You know, just eyeballing it like that.
|SC|That's great. Then, that is the SIVB, huh?
|CAPCOM|Okay. Well, we — you might check it this way, Jack. Line up the star Deneb Ola and Rigel. Say again, Regulus, I'm sorry, Regulus. Deneb Ola and Regulus, and then, on that line, go perpendicular to that line right above Ri — right above Regulus, and that should be the SIVB. It forms one point of a right triangle with Deneb Ola and Regulus.
|SC|What you're saying is it's the eye of Leo the Lion.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed.
|SC|Except, we can't see Leo the Lion very well.
|CAPCOM|Okay .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 19:04 CST 70:10 GET MC280/1
070:10:00|CAPCOM|And 17, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|We've got a rather lengthy flight plan update series here. We can read up to you anytime you want. Just a reminder that we are sitting here waiting with it. Your call.
|SC|Generally what is it, Bob.
|CAPCOM|It's changing a number of attitudes all through the flight plan, 84 32, 84 35, changing VERB 49 maneuver, things like that due to the TLC change here on times and that.
|SC|Okay, where are you going to start?
|CAPCOM|Okay, at that 8432 , standby one. Ah, Jack, Flight just told me we can wait on this if you want until some other time in the flight plan. We want to get into this experiment checklist with the pan camera, mapping camera film cycling. Or we can do both of them concurrently.
|SC|Hey, Bob, let's get the camera cycling out of the way first and then we'll pick up the flight plan update.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we concur with that.
|SC|Okay, Bob, I'll get to that camera, just a second. The coast of Australia is starting to come into view. Still looks pretty clear. Will give you more on that later probably. That cyclone I talked about yesterday in the vicinity, I believe, of the Solomon Islands, looks even better organized than yesterday. It's really tightening up. Starting to look very bright and dense right in the core, not to dissimilar from Therese. Although, has a little broader extent in the southeast quandrant.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Read that.
|CAPCOM|Trying to match that up in my prog here, I can't find it.
|SC|Well, you didn't have it there yesterday either. It certainly looks like a tight little storm now though.
|CAPCOM|Roger, I understand.
|CAPCOM|Jack, would you mind repeating that location of that.
|SC|Can't give you must on the progress —
|SC|Well, I'll try to give it to you a little better later. It's the one I was talking about yesterday as being in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands. That's somewhat east, southeast of New Guinea.
|CAPCOM|Yeah. Roger. I've got it.
|SC|I think before we go to bed we'll probably be able to update the progress of the, that front south of Australia also.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 19:04 CST 70:10 GET MC280/2
070:10:00|CAPCOM|Roger. I've got a pretty disorganized area to the east of New Guinea. It's probably right over the Solomons. Looks pretty disorganized on our satellite photo. From, let's see, I guess that was this morning sometime.
|SC|Well, there is a lot of cloudiness in the Equatorial regions, inner-tropical convergence zone in there. This is south of that, sort of. I'll talk to you later.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Houston, how do you read 17?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Okay, S-band AUX TB to science, mark it.
|SC|Okay, SMAC is coming on. Mark it. Mapping camera to standby. Mark. Pan camera power is: power, barber pole, book grey, self test is to heaters and you want the high gain?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. Minus 50 on PITCH and 2 70 on YAW.
|SC|Okay, there she is all locked up. PCM rates going high.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, when you're ready, I'll do the big deal here .
|CAPCOM|Roger, standby for my cue on that, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we're ready.
|SC|Okay, mapping camera, mapping camera is ON.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we mark it,
|SC|Okay, and pan camera, self test, going self test. Got a barber pole.

070:23:00|SC|And the pan camera self test or talk back is gray .
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'd like reacq on the high gain check.
|SC|You got it.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SC|Sorry, I didn't read the check list.
|SC|(garble) cameras off.
|CAPCOM|Jack say your last.
|SC|Mapping camera went off at 2 minutes and the pan camera power is off.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and we'd like to select your checklist angles now on the high gain, please.
|SC|Okay. Okay, you want those on the dial you don't want me to try to acquire there do you.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay, smac power is going to come off here now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, smac power is off and how is my ZPN doing?
|CAPCOM|Jack, say again your question please.
|SC|This is Ron how is my ZPN doing?
|CAPCOM|Oh, roger let me take a look here. Hey, Ron, we'don't want to say it's bad, but we're glad your talking to us because we want to make sure your with us.
|SC|Okay somebody did listen a little bit then.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we think we've got a bad skin sen sor in her face here Ron.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 70 hours 26 minutes. Apollo 17's distance from Earth 186 663 nautical miles, velocity 2 436 feet per second. This is Apollo control at 70 hours 2 7 minutes. We have another update on the S-IVB stage. Impact time and coordinates predicting an impact time of 89 hours 39 minutes 38 seconds at 4 degrees 21 minutes south, 12 degrees 12 minutes west.
|SC|Bob, how do you read 17?
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Okay, that storm I'm talking about a little more precisely is maybe centered at 2 degrees latitude north of the Solomon Islands.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that kind of matches up Jack. Does it look like New Guinea and that is pretty well clobbered?
|SC|No, not really New Guinea is at the western edge of a cloud zone that is part of that in te r t rop i cal convergence zone that starts at New Guinea and swings east north east in an arc for about half the visible Pacific and then that arc crosses back down over the equator and heads generally toward central America. I suspect, although, that's beyond the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 19:16 GET 70:23 281/2
070:23:00|SC|terminator now. The storm I'm talking about is clearly south and separate from that inter-tropical convergence cloud pattern.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It's getting very tightly wound and the clockwise sense, and - and it's just where there was a less well organized pattern yesterday. Although, maybe it has moved northward a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we understand Jack.
|SC|Our zero zero phase point Bob is about 10 degrees - make that 15 degrees longitude east of the Solomons and has a - is a fairly low intensity at this time. I' 11 keep an eye on it as it approaches that storm area and see if it changes. Okay, Bob just one last thing on that line of clouds that stretches up toward Hawaii they look very thick and dense based on the structure you can see as the terminator approaches them. They cast a pretty strong shadow to the west.
|CAPCOM|Rog, I see those on our satellite photo. They look pretty thick in there. I'm strictly an amateur talking to you Jack, but looks pretty thick in there.
|SC|Yeah, right.
|SC|How about some flight - when you come around again can you start the flight plan updates.
|CAPCOM|Any time you want them I can start them.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the first one is at 84:32 in the fli gh t pi an.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 GET 70:34 CST 19:28 MC282/1

|SC|Say again the. Say again the number in parenthesis.
|CAPCOM|R roll of 150. 150.
|SC|Okay, at 8432 roll right 12 degrees to roll 150.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And in parenthesis here, just a comment, it's to avoid gimbal lock during verb 49 maneuver directly below it.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. At 8435, the verb 49 maneuver, change the attitude to roll 320, pitch 010, yaw 324. And we want the high gain antenna angles: pitch minus 29, yaw 17. Over.
|SC|Okay. 320, 010, 324. High gain, pitch minus 29, yaw 17 and that's at, that's for the verb 49 manuever at 8435.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed. And it goes without saying scratch out OMNI alpha there.
|SC|Got you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the next one is at 8542. 8542.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|This is just a couple of notes here. The P52 stars we got in the CMS are 16 and 17. Gyro torquing will take 10 minutes 47 seconds. 10 minutes 47 seconds.
|SC|Okay, the stars will be stars 16 and 17. Torquing will take 10 minutes 40 seconds. 47 seconds.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack. Okay, at 8544 over there on the right where it says LOI REFSMMAT attitude change that roll 064, pitch 135, yaw 005. Over.
|SC|Okay, got you. Change is to roll 064 pitch 135, yaw 005.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, I'm going to take a break here, and you can go ahead and secure the high gain and go inyo the OMNI Bravo, and call me when you're ready for some more of these.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. The next one is an addition at 86 hours. We just want the following words. Manually pressurize SPS. Over.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, did you get that last one, 86 hours.
|SC|Roger. 86 hours, manually pressurize the SPS.

|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Where it says manual roll left to 30 degrees, change 30 degrees to 63 degrees. 63 degrees. Change the roll angle from 050 to 001.
|SC|Okay, that's roll left 63 degrees and the roll is 001.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. And the new high gain angles will be pitch minus 27, yaw 339.
|SC|Okay. Minus 27 and 339.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just a little bit below that at where it, about 872 7 or 8730, where it says manually roll right 30 degrees, change the 30 to 63. 63. Change the roll to 06 4.
|SC|Okay, roll right 63 degrees. Roll will b e 0 6 4 .
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. And scratch out OMNI alpha and add high gain antenna pitch minus 29, yaw 17. Yaw 17.
|SC|Okay. High gain pitch minus 29, yaw 17 .
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. And the next one is over at 8903. We've got a COMM attitude.
|SC|Okay, 89 03.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that attitude there should, it's pretty close. Roll 165, pitch 060, yaw 338.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Did you get that last, the attitude change, it's real trivia change, we probably shouldn't have called it, but it's 165 060 338.
|SC|8903, excuse me.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Did you get that attitude at 8903?
|SC|Repeat 8903.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Roll 165 pitch 060, yaw 338.
|SC|Okay, 165, 060 338.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 19:39 GET 70:45 MC283/1
070:45:00|SC|Okay. New COMM attitude, 16506060338.
|CAPCOM|Rog. That seems hardly worth it on that, Jack. Sorry on that one. Just one last note, a general note, on all this we gave you1Everything has been checked in the CMS. You probably figured that anyway.
|SC|Roger. Always know those fellows are working with us .
|CAPCOM|Roger. And, Ron, we've got good data on you n ow .
|SC|Is that it?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack.
|SC|Okay, thank you Jack.
|SC|Bob, Gene just told me I may have confused you on the clouds that I told you I could see near the terminator with a good shadow -- the shadow's on the eastern side as the terminator approaches.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo --
|CAPCOM|How do you read, 17?
|SC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I mentioned earlier, I can't remember exactly when, that it looked like the pattern of water in the Ross Sea or clear areas within the Ross Sea ice packs had changed, and I feel more strongly about that now. It looks like it's opened up considerably. The tri — long elongated triangular areas, two of them that were there a couple of days ago seem to have merged, and you also have clear water along most of the inner portion of the shoreline of that Sea.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Must be getting towards summertime down there.
|SC|Well, I'm very surprised that it's changed shape as much as that, and it could be that that triangular pattern was caused by a cloud bank that split what is now open water, and made it look as if it was icepack.
|CAPCOM|Rog, understand.
|SC|Hey, Bob, can one of the guys there give me a hack on when the terminator should cross Hawaii?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'll look it up.
|SC|Do it in either GET or CST, either one.
|CAPCOM|We'll crank it up to you in GET.

|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston. We missed the NOUN 05 on the data -- can you give us what your NOUN 05 was?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 19:39 GET 70:45 MC283/2
070:45:00|SC|Would you believe 5 balls?
|CAPCOM|Oh, I'd believe that.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead and talk, Ron.
|SC|Roger, roger. We'll talk at 30 -- 5430.
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|We've been listening to the playback of the DSE tape from the ALFMED period, and all three of you sound pretty good on that. Gene is still clearer than the rest, but all three of you sound real clear and very readable.
|SC|Excellent. That'll make up for my note-taking.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|And, also, Jack. You had a question earlier about different response of sea and continental areas when viewed through monocular polarizing filter, and I've got a note here from John Dietrich that kind of explains it.
|SC|Okay, let's hear what John has to say.
|CAPCOM|Okay. This is pretty much referencing the time you were looking at it, and here it is. "Ocean scenes near the bright area off Bolivia, which is the specular point, include a high proportion of polarized light. The spacecraft, Earth, Sun geometry now is approximately equal to the Brewster angle which is nearest 53 degrees where maximum plane polarization due to reflection occurs. Therefore, a high response of scene brightness to changes of filter position can be expected. Continental scenes are dominated by Lamburgian or diffuse reflectors which are characterized by low proportion of polarization in the reflected beam. For such scenes, changing position of the polarization filter produces changes in scene brightness that are near or below the threshhold of detectability." Over.
|SC|Okay. That sounds very good. It's sort of like the contrast between the lunar surface response the oceans being more like that, I guess, and between the lunar surface and terrestrial land surfaces.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 19:52 GET 70:59 284/1
070:59:00|SC|That's very good very interesting. Thank John for me. I should have thought about that, but I've been away from it too long.
|CAPCOM|Okay, terminator over Hawaii at 73:45 GET.

|PAO|This is Apollo control at 71 hours 2 minutes. Apollo 17's distance from Earth now 187 507 nautical miles, velocity 2 416 feet per second. On Monday 80 foreign students who are touring space research science centers in the United States will begin a three day visit here at the Manned Spacecraft Center. They will observe the three periods of lunar exploration by astronauts Cernan and Schmitt and will also tour the facilities at MSC. This International youth tour began December 2 in Washington D. C. and is being conducted under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with the cooperation of the state department. The student group saw the Apollo 17 launch at Cape Kennedy and since that time have toured the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Oakridge National Laboratory facilities in Tennessee. Today they're at the NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama tomorrow they will tour the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Bureau of Standards in Bouider, Colorado. The students were selected by their respective governments in response to a NASA invitation, and they range in age from 15 to 17 years and rank high academically and have strong scientific interests. Following their visit to Houston the group will tour the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffitt Field, California and the jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. Schedules for the visit here at MSC and a complete list of the participating students, and countries may be obtained at the MSC news center. At 71 hours 5 minutes this is mission control, Houston.

071:17:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We got you at 130 right now.
|SC|Okay, Houston, this is LMP, what was the last number you saw on my heart rate?
|CAPCOM|Okay, you peaked at 135 and we had you 130 for several minutes.
|SC|- Okay.
|CAPCOM|Jack, just for interest, in that time you got banging around so hard, you caused the heaters in the H2 to shut off. The pressure went up until the heater shut off.
|SC|Well, that's what you wanted, wasn't it?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|SC|Good thing, there's not another mission or we'd have to flight plan this kind of thing for your EECOMS.
|CAPCOM|That's right. Got to conserve at all costs.
|SC|Who's sitting on your right tonight?
|CAPCOM|Got a big Moon over there.
|SC|He's always there, isn't he.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Say, Bob, I took another picture of the Earth and forgot to give you the GET on it. That was about 15 minutes before the end of the ALFMED experiment. If you can go back that way.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Let me see Jack. The last thing we had was right about the end of it. We had you in Sierra, Sierra frame 50. And you had four pictures then. Is that before that or after that? Okay, those four were for the ALFMED, weren't they?
|SC|That's affirm. No, this was with the Hasselblad, the EL camera.
|CAPCOM|Oh, okay, got you. We had FTO working on matching that one up.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Ho us t on, 17 .
|CAPCOM|Go ahead Jack.
|SC|Roger, that weak front that I talked about south of Australia yesterday has moved north, but it looks considerably weaker than it did yesterday, even. Just a very thin line of clouds, very thin line of clouds that now is touching the tip of Australia (Garble)
|SC|Houston, 17. I think maybe you dropped out, before I said that little weak front moving north northeast south of Australia. The western end of It is just touching the coast of Australia, south of Perth, but it looks much weaker, and I, right now, would not expect
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 GET 71:17 CST 20:11 MC285/2
071:17:00|SC|very much weather out of it .
|CAPCOM|Okay. That, I can't tie up with you on that one, Jack, because my prog doesn't go down that far. It only stays up in the landing area. And my satellite photo doesn't go down that far south either. So, I can't touch up with you on that one.
|SC|Okay. Well, it looked (garble) stronger yesterday and it might develop. Now, there is a larger disturbance in the southeastern end of that front. Still south of Tasmania, although I suspect unless it stays on a pretty northerly course, it will not effect the weather on the east coast of Australia very much.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Jack, just thought you might be interested. I called some friends of yours in Tucson and everybody's fine there and wanted to say hello and tell you everybody's fine and getting along real good.
|SC|Thank you very much. Good to hear. They've learned to take care of themselves pretty well, h aven't th ey.
|CAPCOM|They sure have. They're having a little trouble with the squawk box, and we'll get working on that. They're having trouble reading a little bit, but they're keeping up with us.
|SC|That's nothing new. But, try to fix it please.
|CAPCOM|Oh, we'll definitely on that one.
|SC|Bob, Ron got you the Earth down there zeroed in the sextant, and it puts my little binocular to shame. I tell you it's a fine instrument. And I'll just confirm that the disturbance over the Solomon Islands is an awfully tightly wound little storm system, and right now, I finally have seen New Zealand for the first time in a couple of days for sure. And the South Islands got some probably high cirrus over it* North Island looks pretty clear. That's the end that I can get right n ow .
|CAPCOM|Roger. We thought you were looking at Regulas, didn't realize you were looking at the Earth instead.
|SC|Ron's been looking for the booster. And he called me down and asked me to look at the Earth. He's been holding out on me.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Pass the torch of weather forecasting to Ron.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Jack. I also have some words for you and Gene. Got some advice from the home front the thing to do with Ron in the future is to hook up a -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 GET 71:17 CST 20:11 MC285/3

|CAPCOM|Ron, everybody's fine over at El Lago. They are doing great. Listening at every word.
|SC|Very good, Bob. Thank you very much.
|SC|Hey, Bob. We got two of those flashers out there. They could be SLA panels. I don't know. They're a like in intensity and pretty regular in the intensity bright and dim flashes they come out with and they're widely separated. One is about the position we called at the first time; the other one is, oh, as I'm looking at the Earth, far to the left. Closer to the center window now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Ho us ton, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Yah, Bob, what is your analysis chart that you haven't, terms analysis chart show for Hawaii today.
|CAPCOM|Standby on that.
|CAPCOM|Jack, according to the ---
|SC|--- is that using your chart
|CAPCOM|Go ahead on that, Jack.
|SC|I was going to say, using your terminator time as a partial mark for where Hawaii ought to be, Hawaii ought to be, it looks like that cyclonic circulation at the north end of the cloud bank I described approaching that area, would be just about on the Hawaiian Islands. I'm curious if they're getting some weather down there now.
|CAPCOM|Standby, right now I've got my weather man right beside me here.
|SC|Also that major front we talked about last night as being east and south of Japan, it's progressed even farther and is, oh, maybe 20 degrees longitude, about 20 degrees longitude from the Hawaiian Islands and I'm making some guesses on exactly where Hawaii is.
|SC|Roger, Jack, we've got nothing adverse in the Hawaiian area at all. Just a lot of wind, high wind, surface wind, surface roughness, but we'don't have any bad cloud area in the Hawaiian area. I'll get the Hickam sequence report here shortly, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I don't know, maybe I, our zero phase point is now centered just a little south of the disturbance near the Solomon Islands, and I see no distinct change in the intensity of that zero phase point over what I had talked about a couple hours ago.
|SC|Roger, Jack. The Solomons Island dis turbance center is confirmed on this chart that I've got. It's very definitely confirmed in there.
|SC|Okay. Well it's a lot more obvious today than yesterday; but even then it was showing a pretty strong circulation. It is starting to wrap up. Look very much like Therese did yesterday.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 20:30 CST 71:36 GET MC2 86/2
071:36:00|CAPCOM|Roger, I'm sure of that. The one right off of Vietnam is also pretty tight, isn't it still.
|SC|Well, we can't see that one yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Australia generally is still very clear except in the northeastern portion where it looks like they have got scattered clouds; but it looks like a pretty night -over Australia.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Looks that way from the satellite photo from the last couple days. Looks pretty nice down there.
|SC|Righ t .
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 71 hours 46 min utes. Weather reporter, Schmitt, is 188 524 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft from which he is observing is traveling at a speed of 2392 feet per second.
|CAPCOM|Jack, in looking at the sequence reports for Hickam and Hilo and that area, it looks like they just got their standard 3500 scattered, 4500 broken clouds, maybe a rain shower or two. But just their standard tropical fluffy cloud.
|SC|Ah, Houston, Apollo 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|Ah, Bob I don't know whether I told you or not, but, we ended up with the LMP and the CDR's suit in the bottom of the suit bag. My suit is in the top and I sure don't have any idea how in the world the other crews got three suits in there. I guess they never did because these things are plum full right now, of suits. In the suit bag and it's a good thing we lengthened them. I don't have room for anything else inside the suit bag. The water bag and, you know, the contingency water bag and my G suit and those flight things I found a place to stick them all around the wall on the outside of the suit thing.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. Good work.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 20:47 GET 71:54 287/1
071:54:00|SC|Bob, you made some comment earlier about the weather it may have been Hawaii, but you broke up.
|CAPCOM|Roger I just got the sequence report for Hawaii. Hickam had 35 hundred scattered 45 hundred broken with minor rain showers and Hilo had about the same and basically it's just their tropical pumpy weather out there. Typical - nothing no frontal type weather or no cyclonic type weather1J*
|SC|Okay, well it may be just patterns induced by the wind currents or maybe I don't have the position of Hawaii quite right.
|CAPCOM|Well, it's possible they do have high winds out there and I've seen it just flying in that area in the past where those broken clouds get pretty close together at times it almost looks like a solid overcast. And especially when you look at it from an angle they all blend together.
|SC|1 boPe your going to save all those charts your gathering together as we talk about it on this outbound leg. Be interesting to compare them and the pictures we take sometime in January.
|CAPCOM|Jack the weather just was out here and they told me that's exactly what their doing and if your time will permit m January they'd like to go through and maybe help piece them all together. But, they're going through these transcripts and they re gathering all their satellite pictures plotting what your seeing versus the satellite pictures etc. etc. and they'd like to go over it with you when you get back1J
|SC|x'd love to do that. I hope in general we re getting the directions right at least I know I'm going to worry about the description and it's hard to place points on the globe particularly in the Pacific if you can't identify land masses near them or have those nice little latitude and longitude lines painted on the Earth.
|CAPCOM|That's right. We'll put in a request tor some lat and long lines out there.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we're going to have a slight change over from goldstone to honeysuckle at 72 hours so We will probably break up1F
|SC|Okay, Bob you know youre just the last turn or so you started to break up occasionally as if you might be getting a bad mike button or something.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll check it out.
|CAPCOM|17 Houston through honeysuckle how do you read?
|SC|You're loud and clear Bob.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/9/72 CST 20:47 GET 71:54 287/2
071:54:00|CAPCOM|Roger, sameo sameo.
|SC|Houston 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|I just played with the polarizing filter again and it looks as if when you have the knob on the filter parallel to the, - roughly parallel to the polar axis of the Earth you get maxium darkening and of course the opposite 90 degrees to that you get maximum lightening of the globe. And in the case of Australia it also appears to lighten and darken, but not to the extent of the ocean areas.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|You could be in the more desert climate you get finer grain material on the ground and give you the response that John Detrich had talked about.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Ho us ton, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack.
|SC|I rechecked that little story I was trying to give you about the ice pack there in the Ross Sea.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And whether I was right a couple of days ago or not - whether I was right a couple of days ago or not in the patterns right now there is a lot of open water between the ice pack and the inner or let's say southern and south eastern shore of the sea that I don't recall being there the other day.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I don't know whether any of you have any connections with all the Marine stations in Antartica, but maybe somebody knows what the ice packs been doing the last few days.
|CAPCOM|I'll see if we can find out, Jack. I don't think we've got any gauge in Antartica, though.

072:12:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 72 hours 14 minutes. Apollo 17 now 189 167 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 2377 feet per second. And, we're just over an hour away from the time that Apollo 17 will enter the lunar sphere of influence. Flight Dynamics Officer, Bill Boone, has re computed the time for that event. That will occur at 73 hours 17 minutes 45 seconds.
|SC|Ho us ton, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, 17.
|SC|Yeah,I — may have misled you earlier about a storm system south of Tasmania. Its -- if there is one, it's just developing, and it's probably 20 degrees longitude south. As I recall yesterday, there was some indication that a couple fronts were joining forces and moving in that direction. Today, the weaker and more western front appears to have dominated the system, and the only area where there seems to be cyclonic circulation developing is that point way south of Tasmania. That conceivably might move up and affect New Zealand in a few, in a couple days, but right now I don't see how it could affect Australia.

|CAPCOM|17, Houston, did you call?
|SC|Yeah, just wondered if you're reading us now, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Reading you now loud and clear. I was just off a minute there talking to Barbara on the phone. Everybody's fine on the home front, Gene.
|SC|Okay, what did you say Tracy said earlier?
|CAPCOM|She just said she is tickled pink and listening on the squawk box.
|SC|I guess that's the way a nine year old daughter should be in a case like this, huh?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|In case she's not listening tell her not to forget to feed the horses.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Barbara said I should find some nice young female voice around here to tell you she loves you, and good night, but I figure we'd better not do that.
|SC|Okay, enough said.
|SC|I guess what we'don't need right now is a nice female voice.
|CAPCOM|I'm sure of that.
|SC|We're just happy, healthy, hungry and homes i ck .
|CAPCOM|Ron, you got a lot of work to do and you better not say you're hungry, the doctor about went through the overhead over here when you said that.
|SC|Ah, that's a cliche.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, just in general how is the spacecraft looking to you? Pretty good, I hope.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. We haven't found anything, I guess we're, stop getting those spurious master alarms here for a while so that was the only witch hunt we were having right there, was trying to find that.
|SC|Yeah, they disappeared. The ones we've had recently seem to be real ones.

073:20:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 73 hours 23 minutes. On it's present trajectory and without doing a lunar orbit insertion burn Apollo 17 would reach it closest approach to the Moon at a ground elapsed time of 88 hours 58 minutes 12 seconds. The distance of that closest approach would be 53.48 nautical miles and spacecraft velocity at that time would be 8 198 feet per second. We expect the crew to settle down into an 8 hour rest period here very shortly. On the flight plan that rest period due to begin at 73 hours some 24 minutes ago. we'do expect that the crew will shortly go into that rest period.

Gene Kranz and the white team of flight controllers are preparing to take over duties in the Mission Control Center, relieving the orange team which has been directed tonight by Chuck Lewis. This has been a relatively quiet shift. A major activity was the medical experiment to gather more information on light flashes that most Apollo crews have seen with their eyes closed. We also updated the ground elapsed time clock during this shift, moving it ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes, this being necessary to bring the Greenwich mean time ground elapsed time in the flight plan into agreement. These areas had not agreed because of the late launch. The crew reported seeing the S-IVB in the distance at one time during the shift. The spacecraft entered the lunar sphere of influence at 73 hours 17 minutes 45 seconds, and we said goodnight to the crew at 73 hours 47 minutes. 6 hours 8 minutes remaining in this rest period now. There will be no change of shift news conference when the shift breaks at midnight - no change of shift news conference. In its present time, Apollo 17 is 30 705 nautical miles from the Moon, velocity 3 378 feet per second. At 74 hours 52 minutes this is Mission Control Houston.

075:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 75 hours 37 minutes. Flight director Gene Kranz and the oncoming white team of flight controllers have been going over the status of the mission and find everything progressing very smoothly at this point. There are no anomalies in the performance of the spacecraft. All systems in very good shape and we're either up to or slightly ahead of the flight plan values on consumables at this point. During the shift a number of the flight controllers will begin working on some of the data the crew will use on awakening to place the spacecraft in lunar orbit, that event scheduled to occur at about 88 hours 56 minutes, and the retrofire officer and the flight dynamics officer will be busy during this shift working out some of the preliminary numbers that'll be used in the lunar orbit insertion maneuver. There is still no decision as to whether or not midcourse correction 4 will need to be performed and we suspect that that decision will also be made later on during this shift. At the present time Apollo 17 is 29 152 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity is now 3 391 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.

076:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 76 hours 37 minutes. Now about 4 - 1/2 hours away from the scheduled crew awakening time, the flight surgeon reports that the crew appears to be resting comfortably at this time. Command Module Pilot Ron Evans is wearing the biomedical harness during this sleep period. And Commander Gene Cernan has the watch wearing the headset that would receive any call from the control center. Apollo 17 is 27 178 nautical miles from the Moon. And we're watching the velocity gradually build up under the growing affect of lunar gravity, up now to 3411 feet per second. This is Apollo control Houston standing by at 76 hours 38 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 02:30 CST 77:37 GET MC 296/1
077:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 77 hours 37 minutes, continuing to maintain the watch while the crew aboard Apollo 17 gets some sleep - Now about 3 1/2 hours left in that sleep period and that could be extended by 30 minutes or so if a decision is made not to make the final midcourse correction before going into lunar orbit. We expect to be getting a reading on the necessity for that midcourse correction which in any event will be a very small maneuver, before this shift ends. The midcourse correction opportunity occurs at 83 hours 55 minutes in the flight plan and the Flight Dynamics officer has gotten what appears to be a good final indication of the impact coordinates for the Saturn third stage. The latest coordinates are 4 degrees 11 minutes south and 12 degrees and 23 minutes west. Apollo 17 at this time - 25 131 nautical miles from the Moon. The spacecraft velocity 3434 feet per second. This is Apollo Control at 77 hours 38 minutes

078:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 78 hours 37 minutes. There's been no change in the spacecraft status during the past hour. Everything continues to function normally and we have about two and one half hours remaining in the crew's sleep period. The flight dynamics officer reports that we've got a midcourse correction if it's performed prior to Lunar Orbit Insertion of about one half foot per second or less and that very small maneauver, if performed, would occur at 83 hours 55 minutes. Apollo 17 is now 23 112 nautical miles from the Moon and the spacecraft velocity up to 3 460 feet per second. We'll see that increase to somewhat in excess of 80 000 feet per second as the spacecraft reaches the Moon and swings around the Moon goes into orbit. The Lunar Orbit Insertion Burn removes on the order of 3 000 feet per second from that velocity. A lunar orbital velocity of about 1 mile per second. The flight surgeon has noted some stirrings of a bit of an elevation in the heart rate of Ron Evans, who is wearing the bio-medical sensors during this sleep period, although for the most part Evans has been sleeping soundly. At 78 hours 39 minutes, this Apollo Control, Houston.

079:37:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 79 hours 37 minutes. Now about an hour and 1/2 away from the scheduled time for crew awakening. And it has again been very uneventful, very quiet sleep shift. With the flight controllers here in mission control monitoring spacecraft systems. Everything continuing to perform almost perfectly as planned; everything nominal. And our flight dynamics display at the present time is showing the spacecraft distance related to Earth, Apollo 17 now 198 .800 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed again with respect to Earth of 2168 feet per second. After awakening the crew's major activities during the day include jettisoning the scientific instrument module door which exposes the scientific instruments in the spacecraft's service module to the lunar environment. Lunar orbit insertion is scheduled to occur at about 88 hours 56 minutes. The Saturn third stage will be impacting the lunar surface. And there's still a possibility of a final midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion. That midcourse correction to occur - if it occurs at 83 hours 55 minutes. And we expect that we will have a decision or recommendation from the flight dynamics officer within the next couple of hours as to whether or not that midcourse correction will be required. If it is done, it will be a very small maneuver performed with the reaction control system thrusters on the CSM. At 79 hours 39 minutes this is Apollo control Houston. This is Apollo Control at 80 hours 41 minutes. We have about 18 minutes remaining before the scheduled crew awakening time, however, we're planning to give them at least an additional 15 minutes of sleep and perhaps 30 minutes additional. The Flight Dynamics officer hopes to delay a decision on the need for midcourse correction 4 until additional tracking data is available. That maneuver, if its performed, remains very small - on the order of a half foot per second. And the decision revolves around what height of approach pericynthion we'll have with or without the maneuver. Tracking data right now shows that Apollo 17 will be approaching the Moon with a pericynthion of about 52 nautical miles - the desired peri — cynthion is 53 1/2. And the FIDO would like to get a bit more tracking data before making that decision. So we 11 be putting off the decision as to whether or not to awaken the crew or give them more sleep time until the last possible moment. Apollo 17 at this time is 18 839 nautical miles from the Moon and the velocity up to 3500 feet per second. We've seen no signs of activity aboard the spacecraft. The Flight Surgeon will begin to note increased heart and respiration rates on Ron Evans, who is wearing the bio-medical sensors during the sleep period and before receiving a call from the crew we'll see the voice sub-carrier come on and we'll be watching for any of those cues. If it appears that the crew is indeed up and about we'll bring the lines up and standby live or as soon as the decision is made to send them a wake-up call we'll come up and standby live. At 80 hours 44 minutes this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 81:25 CST 06:18 MC 300/1
081:25:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 81 hours 25 minutes. We are planning to put a call through to the crew in about 5 minutes to awaken them and Apollo 17, at this time, is about 17 350 nautical miles from the Moon. Spacecraft velocity is about 3567 feet per second. After awakening the crew we will be discussing a minor problem that has been noted during the sleep period. This involves a heater cycling in one of the three cryogenic hydrogen tanks that supplies hydrogen to the fuel cells. The nature of the problem is a heater that is cycling more often than normal. These heaters are controlled by a^ ^ pressure-sensitive switch on the tank as the temperature within the tank drops and the pressure drops. The switch senses this and activates the heater to bring up the temperature and hence the pressure within the tank and ensure a constant flow of ^ hydrogen to the fuel cells. The sensor appears to be responding to a much narrower range of temperature decrease that would normally respond to about a 20 degree excursion in temperature and it is now apparently responding to about a 2 to 3 degree temperature excursion, and therefore cycling more rapidly than would normally be the'case. This in itself is of no concern, however if the automatic cycling should fail, if the automatic cycling function should fail, it would require going to a backup manual mode whereby the crew would be instructed to turn the heaters on and off at certain intervals to maintain the proper pressure in the tank, which, by the way, is a mode of operation that has been used on previous missions, and works very well with a minimum impact to the crew time. And, as mentioned at this point we would see no reason for having to go to a manual mode. That would require some subsequent failure. This situation, however, will be discussed with the crew and they'll be advised as to the procedure that would be taken in the event that subsequent failure should occur necessitating the manual activation of the heater within this one tank. And we are now about 1 minute 50 seconds away from the scheduled awakening time, having given the crew an additional 30 minutes of sleep. The flight dynamics officer expects to give us a GO or NO/GO for the midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion in about a half an hour at some 82 hours ground olapsod time. We'll continue to stand by live for that call to the crew .

081:31:00|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston, did you call?
|SC|Good morning Houston, anybody there?
|CAPCOM|Okay, good morning, it's LOI day, Apollo 17.
|SC|Hello, Robert, you gave us an extra half hour.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. We're presently still debating on midcourse 4, Geno, and at the present time it's small, about a half a foot per second, we're expecting a final decision on whether it's necessary or not in approximately 1 hour at 82:30. We 11 let you know then, but it will be small and so we'decided to give you an extra half hour of sleep.
|SC|Okay, Bob, without me having to look it up when will it come if it comes.
|CAPCOM|Standby. 83:55, so we'll give you about an hour and 25 minutes advance notice.
|SC|Okay. Well, we'll start stiring around.
|CAPCOM|Okay, give me a call when you want to talk to people.
|SC|Hello, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Hello there, 17, good morning.
|SC|I'm not sure we're ready to talk yet, Bob, but I just thought you'd like to know we got a pretty spectacular view of Africa today. We can see the Sinai, can see the Red Sea, the Sea of Aden and for the first time I think we cannot only see the Mediterranean, but we can see the most of the Southern European countries, Turkey and Greece and up in Italy and some of those places, can't quite see Spain because you're just about on the horizon and for the most part, it looks like the weather throughout the Mediterranean and Northern Africa looks pretty good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're copying that. And if you guys are willing to do a little switch flipping this early in the morning, we'd like you to turn on the pan camera heaters, which means if somebody's down there in that vecinity it's SMAC power ON and the self test switch to heaters. Over.
|SC|You want the SMAC power ON and the self test switch to heaters.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|SC|Okay, we'll get that.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, we got both of those.
|CAPCOM|Gee, I didn't wake you up, did I?
|SC|Well -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 6:36 GET 81:42 MC 302/1
081:42:00|SC|Okay, Bob. The LM/CM Delta P is .6.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Sounds good.
|SC|Hello, Houston, Apollo 17. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Hello. Loud and clear, 17. We're with you.
|SC|Okay, we'didn't get you there for about 5 minutes, Bob, but good uplink signal strength. We're you guys having a p roblem?
|CAPCOM|No, not that I know of. We were getting a lot of noise down here and we seem to think that you guys were prob -assumed you guys were turned away from us or something, but we're w ith you.
|SC|No you might think about that one a little bit. We had a very strong uplink - signal strength as good as right now. Gene was trying to call you off and on for several minutes and we'didn't get any response. Sounds real good now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sorry about that.
|SC|Hey, Bob. Good morning. It's a good chance to talk to you for once.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, for once, yeah. Talk to you now this next hour and I won't talk to you again for another 3 or 4 days, Ronald.
|SC|(laughter) Okay.
|CAPCOM|Nice to be able to talk to somebody for a change -
|SC|Bob, your friendly medical officer -
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Go ahead if you've got something to say.
|CAPCOM|(Garbled)
|SC|Okay. Your friendly medical officer has all the good words starting from the CDR and the food. Are you ready to copy?
|CAPCOM|Ready to copy.
|SC|Okay. It was a big day yesterday eating-wise. CDR had sausage patties, pears and cocoa for breakfast. Ham, a quarter, 1-quart ch ee s e-s p re ad. 1/2 bread and 1/2 cereal bar, 1 orange beverage for lunch, tomato soup, half a hamburger, half mustard, vanilla pudding and an orange pineapple drink for dinner.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SC|Five hours of good sleep, and two more containers of water.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, I got the CDR's food and then you broke up and I got 5 hours of sleep and two containers of water. Was there something between?
|SC|That's affirm, your PRD reading 17032.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SC|And I think, Bob, we're coming around different OMNI so I'll wait on the rest of it.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's affirm.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 06:59 CST 82:05 GET MC-303/1
082:05:00|SC|Okay Houston, 17, how do you read now?
|CAPCOM|Okay read you again, go ahead.
|SC|Okay for the LMP the food eaten - well let's see, I guess its a toss-up eaten vs. not eaten. I'll give you what I ate, sausage patties, grits,pears, pineapple-grapefruit drink, coffee and let me make a note that the package of peaches in that pack was broken in the package. Also, I had chicken soup, ham, bread, orange drink and 4 bacon squares. For dinner I sort of ate some left overs and grape drink, corn chowder, chocolate pudding. And I had - stand by. The PRD reading: 24080, and 7 1/2 hours of very good sleep last night. I took a seconal in order to get to sleep and I've had 1 and 1 or 2 and 1/2 containers of water since last report.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy all that, Jack.
|SC|Okay, the CMP. The chow hound of the kennel here had: sausage, grits, fruit cocktail orange beverage and coffee. He had ham, cheese bread, peaches, cereal bar and or an g e-p ine ap p le drink. Later on he had tomato/ soup^ half of a hamburger, half mustard, vanilla pudding, sugar cookies, grape drink and tea. And he has a complaint this morning much like mine that his apricot package had broken in the bag, and although not too severe itself, it makes everything else pretty sticky.
|CAPCOM|I copy that.
|SC|Okay, CMP medical is 15031 PRD, he had 7 hours restless sleep and he'd like a few comments from the doctors on how that looked on his biomed and he had a Seconal and he had 4 containers of water.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy all that one also, Jack, you guys still gonna fit in your space suits?
|SC|If you'd stick around, we tried those on yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Roger copy, tried to talk to you guys yesterday morning but I didn't quite make it, there was a problem apparently some place.
|SC|That's all right, we're stuffing him with food so he can't sleep.
|CAPCOM|Okay and the comment concerning Ron's sleep from the surgeon, Jack is that he was restless the first hour and had periods of restlessness during the night but we logged him for about 7 hours of sleep also. But we'did see periods of wakefulness, some of which were up to 10 minutes long.
|SC|That sounds about right, that's good, thank you. If I can't tell how long I'm awake and you know, how long you were really a sleep.
|CAPCOM|I'll tell you, Ron, you wake up during the night you might sit there and stare at the second hand and then count how long you're awake.
|SC|(Laughter) okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we owe you guys a consumable update. And on RCS consumables you're RCS fuel remaining is still 1.4 percent above the Flight Plan, that's a slight improvement over the 1.3 percent from yesterday.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 06:59 CST 82:05 GET MC-303/2
082:05:00|SC|I guess everything else is about like yes-! terday, is that right, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Roger, consumables are still about the same. If you guys will wind your watches we'll consider the postsleep checklist finished.
|SC|Okay and Geno has got his no bias check for you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, roger on that, we're waiting.
|SC|Okay, Bob, made 2 checks over a period of 100 seconds. One was minus 99.0 and the other was minus 98.9.
|CAPCOM|Okay we copy minus 99.0 and minus 98.9, Geno.
|SC|And -
|CAPCOM|And we'd like omni Charlie, please there, 17.
|CAPCOM|And Apollo 17, Houston, we'd like to recommend you go squelch off at this time if you haven't and we'll keep calling the omni as it changes you're to rotate, over.
|SC|Bob, we've been flying normally with it in able, maybe you think that's the problem?
|CAPCOM|Stand by a minute and while we're thinking about, can we confirm that the only medication you've had is a Seconal for you and a Seconal for Ron, and nothing for the commander?
|SC|This is Geno, that's right, I did not take any Seconal, last night. One thing I wanted to talk to you about though, I took one anti-gas pill after breakfast, I took one after supper and I took one prior to going to sleep which were probably within an hour apart. If you've got a better solution than those gas pills, I'd sure like to hear it.
|CAPCOM|Understand that Gene, we'll get back with you on that later.
|CAPCOM|And, Jack, as far as turning the squelch off, they do believe that we're better with that for margins in general managment than this distance with the omni. As soon as we plot a PTC and go on the high-gain we'll be much better off.
|SC|Okay , Bob .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 07:12 GET 82:18 MC-304/1
082:18:00|CAPCOM|And, 17, Houston. You can do without your water dump now. We're in good shape. We'll dump at 94 hours.
|SC|94 hours. Okay.
|SC|Bob, does that mean we can go ahead with the urine dump on schedule?
|CAPCOM|Say again there, Geno, on the urine dump.
|CAPCOM|Say again, Geno, on the urine dump.
|SC|Rog. Can we press on with it on schedule?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, sir. It's just that we'don't need to do the water dump, that's all.
|SC|Oh.
|SC|Okay, fine.
|SC|Okay, that was 72 30.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that. And part of the reason we had a little problem that this last time, Jack, was we planned to call the OMNI's and we'didn't get the word around down here. And we'didn't call the OMNI to you in time. We're still planning on doing that, and I think we'll be more coordinated next time.
|SC|Okay. We'll bear with you.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, I presume that's magazine November, November.
|SC|That's affirm, Bob.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 07:21 CST 82:28 GET MC305/1
082:28:00|CAPCOM|Omni, Charlie, 17 please.
|SC|Got it .
|CAPCOM|And Apollo 17, Houston, for your information we are scrubbing midcourse 4 and you can stay in PTC until 83:30 which will be about when you start to get ready for LOI anyway. We'll give you a call on that.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 17 now 14 thousand 948 nautical miles from the Moon and CAPCOM, Bob Parker, just advising the crew that we will not require a midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion. The flight dynamics officer had been reviewing tracking data and establishing another vector, as he calls it, on the trajectory based on that last vector and it appeared that a midcourse correction of something less than a half of foot per second would be required, if performed. And flight director, Gene Kranz, made the decision to cancel the midcourse correction prior to lunar orbit insertion.
|SC|We're about three quarters of the way through eating. You got some news for us?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, I'll see, Did you catch the midcourse 4 scrub?
|SC|Yes sir. Apparently, you're not getting some of our acknowledgements.
|CAPCOM|Okay, must be. Captain Young, here, wants to tell you that it's raining outside and the paper boy apparently hasn't come in yet. Omni Delta, please.
|SC|I'm surprised he didn't get his paper delivered before he came in.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I suppose I should apologize to all the paper boys after saying that. But the news is still being put together for you guys. And standby. And Geno, some advice to you on the gas pills. I guess -suggestion down here from the surgeon is that one thing we ought to be sure to do is to chew the pills thoroughly. And apparently it helps in their effectiveness quite a bit and Dr. Young, beside me, also suggested if you're chewing chewing gum you might cut down on that a bit because he thinks this might be causing some gas.
|SC|Thank you.
|SC|I might add that both of those alternatives have been worked on.
|CAPCOM|We thought probably so.
|SC|Bob, although that we're getting close to concentrating our attention on the Moon, it doesn't decrease the interest in looking back at the patterns of activity we can see on the Earth. That storm -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 7:31 GET 82:38 306/1
082:38:00|SC|Spatters of activity we can see on the earth. That storm I talked about yesterday, that was in North Africa, looks like it has left that area and has moved in - maybe, if it's there at all, it's just over the Iberian Peninsula, and maybe Gibraltar and that area is getting a little activity today.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copyright that.
|SC|It does not look very well organized, but - it's not very well organized right now, but - it's right out on the LM and it's hard to get a good view of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|The storm I guessed yesterday, I thought might be moving into the Cape of Good Hope, looks like it's disipating and also staying south of that area. The whole of Africa is essentially clear except in the southern part of the inter-tropical convergence area where there's scattered patches of fairly dense clouds, probably getting scattered rain showers of some kind in there this morning. Some of those extend farther south then I've - we've seen them - down into South Africa. There's a - on one of the earlier REV's, when I looked out of the terminators, it looked like there was a depression developing about 30 degrees longitude east of Madagascar in the middle of the Indian ocean. A little bit northeast of Madagascar there's also a new area of clouds developed that looks like it's getting organized into a cyclo p a 11 e rn .
|CAPCOM|Roger. Turn OMNI alpha, please.
|SC|Okay, you got it?
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, while you guys are finish ing your lunch - your breakfast there, excuse me. Are you all on your headsets?
|SC|Yessir.
|CAPCOM|Okay, let me brief you on a little funny that we saw last night, and I'll start the briefing by mentioning that at the present time, it is not a great concern, but just to keep you up to date with what's going on, let me mention it to you. About 70 hours, which was probably about the time of your last exercise period, we saw 3 funnies with the hydrogen tanks, as I say, none of which is causing any great concern. The first of these was a shift to the limits of the pressure switch, the ones that turns the heaters on and off, remember there are two of those switches, one on tank 1 and one on tank 2 and they work in series, and one of those switches, we can't tell which, but we suspect it's probably tank 2 because of the other funnies, I'll get to in a minute in tank 2. One of those switches went from a 13 psi range, in other words a plus or minus 6.5 psi range. It changed its range down to plus or minus 1.5 psi so its now
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 7:31 GET 82:38 306/2
082:38:00|CAPCOM|total range is only 3 psi. The main result of that is that it means that the pressure switches and the motor switch turning the heater on, acts more frequently or a shorter period of time. The second thing which we observed following this, and we're not at all sure if there is any correlation between this and the others. We observed a high frequency pressure oscillation in tank 2. It was about a 5 psi peak to peak oscillation, a frequency of about 2 cycles per second. And this lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes. A third funny that we observed, this was in tank 2. The third funny that we observed was an erratic, and possibly correlated with the high frequency oscillation, but an erratic total fuel cell occurrance, and here again we were looking at oh, peak to peak variations of something like 5 amps or of 5 to 10 amps. And the suspicion is that coupled with the shift in the limits of the pressure switch, some acoustic vibrations were set up in that tank, and we may have seen them causing the oscillation of the motor switch, which was then reflected in the fuel cell currents. Again these erratic, and possibly correlated fuel cell currents lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes. And since then, all during the night, ther've been no further events of this sort and the pressure switch with its reduced limits has been acting quite normally, just with the reduced limits overnight. As I say again, we're looking at it, people are studying it in great detail, with no real answer at the moment, but there is no great concern at the present. And it appears that the worst that can happen is for the motor switch to stall because of over use. And if this would happen, it would force us to go to manual management of the heaters on the H2 tank. That appears to be the worst, at the moment, that we can anticipate from this group of funnies. Over.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Understand that. You know, I wonder if we ought to stop stirring the cryos the way we've been doing it.
|CAPCOM|That has been suggested, but again, it's not very clear that any of these things are terribly correlated.
|SC|Okay, also, you know, if you want to reduce the activity on that switch, depending on how much you need to have it done during quiet periods such as eat period and things like that, we could go to manual operation,
|CAPCOM|Negative, Jack, because the switch - OMNI bravo, please, 17.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|If you pull out your schematics there, you'll find that no matter what you do, the - you can turn the thing off, in fact, and the switch will continue to operate the motor switch, the pressure switch will continue to operate the motor switch off the service module busses. There's
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 7:31 GET 82:38 306/3
082:38:00|CAPCOM|Nothing you can do. The only thing you'll do if you go from AUTO to MANUAL or OFF is you'll keep the currents from going to the heaters, but the motor switch will still operate.
|SC|Okay. Thank you for the education.
|CAPCOM|And I've been corrected, the frequency of the pressure oscillation was more in the vicinity of a cycle every 4 or 5 seconds.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And 7 -
|SC|Let me ask a couple questions.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 07:40 GET 82:47 MC-307/1
082:47:00|SC|Make sure I understand this. You're not sure whether the heater cycling and the pressure cycling were correlated, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|In a cycle every four or five seconds, is it possible for the heaters to effect the tank that fast?
|CAPCOM|That's not possible, so the only thing really - we think could - the tank is too much of a heat sink to do it that way. What may have happened was that if you set up an oscillation, a mechanical oscillation in the tank to one way or another, that this could then have active back-up on the motor. But the motor switch in driving the heaters could not have reinforced the oscillation because the tank is to much of a heat-sink.
|SC|Okay. When did you say this happened with respect to our exercise period?
|CAPCOM|That's not well pinned down 17. we'do know it hasn't occurred since about 71 hours and it did occur at approximately 70 hours which was about the time of your exercise period. But, we haven't been able to correlate that exactly with the start or the finish of the exercise period.
|SC|Well you know you should be able to do that because of the biomed on the - at least on me and Ron's was on too. But, as soon as I started exercising he you should have the BIO MED data on my heart—rate. It was unscheduled exercise period, we just went into it before eat period, I think. Let me check back.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And, we can check back and time you more specific on what the times were there in terms of your exercise period also. I'd like OMNI Charlie, please, there 17. And we might mention that oscillations like had been seen on the ground under somewhat different circumstances, but oscillations like this have been seen on the ground in ground tests previously. And I might say, also, that as far as other things in the spacecraft are current everything looks absolutely normal, nominal, as the case may be in great shape and I might emphasize again, that we've seen none of this oscillation again since 71 hours. Over.
|SC|Okay. Bob. That was, as you say, pretty close to the exercise. I can't pin it down in the checklist exactly but it was somewhere after ALFMED was complete. And before we changed that canister, I think we changed that canister a little early. About 70:50. So I think the manning should have pretty good data on when we were exercising. And the reason I say that, because the way we were, I was exercising anyway, I'm sort of running in place against the LEB and conceivably could have gotten oscillation going in the tank .
|CAPCOM|Roger. Understand that.
|CAPCOM|OMNI DELTA, 17.
|CAPCOM|And 17, we'did a little investigation of times
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 0 7:40 GET 82:47 MC-307/2
082:47:00|CAPCOM|down here. We found that at 71:12 you were exercising at 130 beats per minute there, Jack. And we think the exercise period ended about 10 minutes later on 71:22. The H2 tank funny started about 71:37 with the pressure switch shift and 71:42 with the oscillations. Over.
|CAPCOM|So then it would be 15 minutes after the exercise period was over.
|SC|Okay. I just wanted to clear my reputation, Bob .
|SC|Now, it's perfectly clean again.
|CAPCOM|As clean as ever anyway.
|CAPCOM|Okay. 17 I guess we'decided to let - we'll run the OMNIs down here instead of having you guys push them all the time. So if you'll select OMNI BRAVO at the present time, then we'll take over and run these OMNIs for you.
|SC|Okay Bob. It's not too big a deal. If any time you think you want to talk to us continuously go ahead and call them, if we're not busy.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that. Let us know when you're ready. I've got a pad here for you guys to copy, but there's no big hurry on it. Finish your eat period and give us a call.
|SC|Okay. I'll be with you in about 5 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Say again there, 17.
|SC|Be right with you, Bob.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|SC|And looking at the Flight Plan, we're going to go ahead and change the canister and we've got the H2 pressure line heaters on. We're going to configure for the urine dump. We'll go ahead and do our stop our PTC at 83:30 and then we'll do our P5 2.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Copy that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 07:50 CST 82:57 GET MC308/1
082:57:00|CAPCOM|And 17, that P52 at 83:10 was primarily intended for the MCC-4. There's some more following anyway before LOI so we suggest you scrub the P52 at 83:10.
|SC|Okay, fine. I may just do a little OJT without torquing.
|CAPCOM|That's your business.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 82 hours 57 minutes. We're completing a shift handover at this time in Mission Control. The team of flight controllers headed by flight director, Gerry Griffin, coming on now to replace the Gene Kranz team. The spacecraft communicator on the upcoming shift is Astronaut Gordon Fullerton. we'do not plan to have a change of shift press briefing at this shift change.
|SC|Bob, when we come out of PTC, then you want us to go right to the SIM door jett attitude.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, 17.
|SC|Okay, and you want us to do that about 80 - 83:30.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's affirm.
|SC|Okay. Bob, what pad are you going to give me?
|CAPCOM|Okay, I've got a - coming up pericynthion plus 2 hour abort pad here.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|SC|Yeah Bob, here's 17. Say, for awhile here, why don't you guys go ahead and manage the OMNI' s I think we can get things done a little better and when it becomes inconvenient for us to switch we'll let you know.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You want us to call 'em to you - is that what you're saying by we managing the omni?
|SC|Yeah, we lose 5 or 10 minutes going around here without COMM and it usually breaks up seemingly when somebody has something to say, either you or us.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Okay. That's fine. Stand by.
|SC|That's up to you guys but seems to me it would be more convenient.
|CAPCOM|Okay, things are good now, Jack. Do you want to copy this pericynthion plus 2 pad at the present time .
|SC|Yeah, I'm just about ready, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, give me a call when you get it,
|CAPCOM|And while you're getting ready there you might think back to yesterday afternoon just after the exercise period and the question that's raised is whether you were running the DAC or some other miscellaneous equipment at that time which might have caused some high current usage?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 07:50 CST 82:57 GET MC308/2
082:57:00|CAPCOM|Or erratic current usage?
|SC|We'll think about that, Bob, but offhand none of us can remember doing anything like that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CAPCOM|Omni, Charlie, 17.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 08:00 CST 83:07 GET MC-309/1
083:07:00|CAPCOM|And 17, your peaceful night shift capcom is signing off, I'll talk to you on the surface, tomorrow, good luck.
|SC|Thank you, Robert, looking forward to seeing you there.
|SC|Are you leaving us, Bob?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, he's already left.
|SC|Boy, he doesn't stick around long, does he? And he wanted to read that FAD to me, well that's too bad. Okay Gordy, I can take the pad now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. It's pericynthion plus 2 SPS/G&N. Weight is 66 373 plus 118 minus 014, ignition time is 0 90:49:55:82, plus 17875 minus 18917, minus 23968, attitude is 237 126 332, and all the rest of the PAD is NA, GDC align stars are Sirius and Rigel 122 354 000. Ullage is none. Remarks: number 1, burn dot, number 2 assumes LOI REFSMMAT, over.
|SC|Okay, pericynthion plus 2 SPS/G&N 66 373, plus 118 minus 014, 0 90:49:55:82, plus 17875, minus 18917, minus 23968, 2 37 126 332, rest of PAD is NA; Sirius and Rigel 122 354 000. No ullage. Remark 1, burn dot 2 is LOI REFSMMAT ass umed.
|CAPCOM|That's correct.
|CAPCOM|Need omni Delta, now.
|SC|Houston 17, canister change complete.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Roger, switch to OMNI Alpha.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 08:10 CST 83:17 GET MC-310/1
083:17:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston, I have the morning news at 1the convenient time.
|SC|Fire away, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Okay, first of all the weather. It's raining fairly - fairly heavily all night, there's a lot of water standing around. Temperatures here are in the high 50's, but it's supposed to get a little cooler tonight with a low in the 40's. I think you know how the Dallas-Redskin game came out, only thing additional mentioned here is that chances look good now that Washington and Dallas may meet in the rubber games where the National Conference representative in the Super Bowl. In the other pro game yesterday, a field goal by Don Cockroft was the difference in a 26 to 24 win by Cleveland over rival Cincinnati. Other sports highlights, the Pittsburgh Steelers play the Oilers today in the Dome, other big games will be Atlanta at San Francisco, Green Bay at Minnesota, and Baltimore at Kansas City. Tennessee State beat Drake University in the Pioneer Bowl 29 to 7. And East Texas State Carson-Neuman in the NAIA football playoffs. The Southwest Conference has pulled out of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Some college basketball scores: The Houston Cougars routed Xavier last night out at Hoffheinz Pavilion 114 to 73 and Rice downed George Washington 93 to 89. Gene, you'll be glad to hear Purdue ripped TCU 101 to 70 and it was Texas over Oklahoma State 86 to 66 and SMU over Oklahoma City 106 to 83. We couldn't find any score on Cal Tech, Jack, but switch to omni Bravo, please. But one final score, Ron, Kansas lost to Iowa 69 to 56. The only thing new on the plane crash Friday in Chicago it's reported here that the plane apparently waved off because another plane was still on the assigned runway. The Democratic Party's stormy session in Washington saw the old guard Democrats apparently take back control of the Party from pro McGovern forces. Mrs. Jean Westwood was replaced as party chairman by Texas lawyer/business man Robert Strauss. Former president Truman appears to be more than holding his own at a hospital in Kansas City. There's a good chance the 88 year former chief executive may be taken off the critical list. There s been a one day interruption in the secret peace talks between Dr. Henry Kissinger and Le Due Tho. The two conferred for over 3 hours yesterday. Both sides have agreed not to talk to news men on any substantive matters. In other news highlights, President Nixon has named Daniel Moynihan as U.S. Ambassador to India. And Chilean President Allende has flown to Cuba to visit Fidel Castro. Here's an interesting one, a 45 year old pilot lost in the Arctic for 31 days has been found alive and well. Three companions were killed. And Soviet party boss Leonoid Breshnev has delayed a scheduled visit to the U.S. It looks as if the visit may come in the fall rather than this coming Spring. One last note: The news media says the flight of Apollo 17 is the smoothest on record so far, and I call that last one pretty accurate reporting, over.
|SC|Thank you Gordo, appreciate the news. Sounds like things are still happening down there.
|CAPCOM|Got some more parochial news here -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 08:10 CST 83:17 GET MC-310/2
083:17:00|SC|Houston we are starting our -
|CAPCOM|to tell you we're starting our WaStCCAPCOM*1okay. A little more parochial news. I have your oxygen consumable status here. Tank 1 Is the"line I percani below the line; the other two are right on the really no news here. Same with the hydrogen, all 3 are essenti y right on the preflight line over1.
|SC|Okay, that's the way like to hear it.
|SC|We'll bring all that home if we can.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|We'd like OMNI Charlie please.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 8:20 GET 83:27 311/1
083:27:00|CAPCOM|Need OMNI DELTA now.
|SC|Okay, Gordie. How would you like a hydrogen purge this morning?
|CAPCOM|Better make sure.
|SC|Go ahead Houston, 17.
|CAPCOM|17, we'do want the hydrogen purge, go ahead.
|SC|Okay, hydrogen purge is in process. You'd never believe it, dust collection container assembly serial number 5725 has developed a hole in it. Fortunately, with a lot of dexterity, I was able to put a piece of tape in the hole.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I guess that's why we sent men into s pace.
|SC|(laughter) Right.
|SC|Gordie, while the purges are going on here, I might mention, a little while ago I looked at the earth through a polaroid colored glass again, and had a full view of Africa, and it appeared of the red and yellow1. portions of Africa, that the land area darkened considerably more than those areas that are green or foliated, and that would be the central portion. That is, they darkened with the handle on the lens going in a north-south rather than e as t-wes t.
|CAPCOM|Roger1.
|SC|The land areas though, still do not show as marked a contrast as do the oceans.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 08:30 CST 83:32 GET MC312/1
083:32:00|CAPCOM|Omni Alpha.
|SC|Okay, hydrogen purge is complete. Heater is going OFF.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Gordy, it looks like the cloudiness and possibly the showers associated with the intertropical conversions over Africa are moving as far south as Johannesburg right now. It's quite a distinct change from even an hour or so ago - a couple of hours ago. They're down into an area where, presumably they're not normally found and vegetation indications are any criteria. And also in the Atlantic - South Atlantic near Goa Island there seems to be a possible storm developing as part of what was probably now a fairly weak front. And whether or not that will develop into anything and move in towards Capetown is hard to say at this time.
|CAPCOM|Rog, Jack.
|SC|It looks as if our old friend at Ascension are enjoying a fairly nice day out there.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Omni Delta, please.
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston. We recall you mentioning the purge complete and the heaters off. We just wanted to be sure that you did leave the H2 purge line heaters on for 10 minutes after terminating the purge. Over.
|SC|Thank you, Gordy. I'll turn them back on .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Who's sitting over there reminding me of all these good things this morning?
|SC|Well, that was a combination effort by John Arron and Charlie Dumis.
|SC|Wow, you've got a real powerful team the re.
|CAPCOM|You bet.
|SC|Hey, you really^ ought to get them a cup of coffee though sometime this morning.
|SC|Gordy, also curious who's watching Challenger this morning?
|CAPCOM|Well, let's see.
|SC|Not much to see, I realize, but i'm sure somebody's there.
|CAPCOM|We need omni Charlie, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Well we've got the first team on - the gold team - your LOI and landing team and the LM guys are Merritt and Thorson.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 08:30 CST 83:32 GET MC312/2
083:32:00|SC|You cut out on the LM, who - who is it?
|CAPCOM|Merlin.
|CAPCOM|Merlin, the Magician,
|SC|I'm sorry Gordy, you clipped off the first again.
|CAPCOM|Merlin Merritt, the magician.
|SC|Oh yes, of course. As I recall he's the only one that1really understands Thorson.
|CAPCOM|He says he doesn't think anybody understands Thorson.
|SC|Well, we're sure looking forward to having a chance to make those guys work a little bit.
|CAPCOM|They say - well - Merlin says he is too. I don't know about Thorson. He's out of the room at the inomen t.
|SC|He probably spilling coffee in SPAN.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|CAPCOM|We need omoni Delta now.
|SC|Gordy, for some reason it's a lot easier to tell the difference between the Antarctic continent and the i ce p acks.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Maybe the glossy sun is picking up the breaks in the ice1pack and giving it a different appearance.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 8:42 GET 83:49 313/1
083:49:00|SC|The continent itself, all you can see are very - what appear to be very gentle differences, or subtle differences in shading, possibly indicating rolling relief due to a photometric dark beam along the - as a function of opal phase angle.
|CAPCOM|Copy.
|SC|And except maybe for the area just - oh, I don't know, even there it's hard to - it looks like the whole visible continent is clear of clouds this morning. Possibly some clouds just east of the Ross Sea, which is just coming into view I think.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I know we'don't have many listeners in Antarctica, but it looks like they're having a exceptionally fine day over the portion of the continent we can see.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|That weak front I mentioned in the south Atlantic stretches from the apparent storm center around Goa Island - I'm not sure about that pronunciation either up just through the coast of South America from Brazil, where it reaches its maximum eastward extent.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Our sub - our zero phase point of the spacecraft is in the middle of the South Atlantic. And it's moderately bright. Although, there is no central bright point at all - a fairly large area, but moderately bright. The sea down there might be moderately choppy or rough this morning.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Ho us t on, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go.
|SC|Okay, Gordie, you might say uh before you start your sentences cause you're clipping your first word. The question I had was the pan camera - we're on 1-6 of the experiments checklist and need your word on whether you want the pan camera off at this time, self test off.
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|We'd like to leave it in heaters.
|SC|Okay, we're leaving it in heaters.
|SC|Okay, Houston. The S-band AUX TV is going to science and I turned the IR on.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'd like OMNI ALPHA.
|SC|How do you read on OMNI ALPHA?
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're readable, fair amount of n oise.
|SC|Hello, Houston. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston. You're clear with considerable noise. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 8:42 GET 83:49 313/2
083:49:00|SC|Houston, how do you read 17?
|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston. Still reading you with a lot of background noise. Over.
|SC|Hello Houston, how do you read?
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. We're still readable.
|SC|Okay, we'll have you up on that high gain pretty soon. I'm turning the IR ON.
|CAPCOM|Roger, roger, roger. IR ON.
|SC|Say again, Gordie.
|CAPCOM|We copy. IR on. Over.
|CAPCOM|America, we'll take the high gain now. PITCH minus 15, YAW 188. Over.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Let's try the high gain now. I see you're moving it. Minus 26 and 199.
|SC|Okay, I think we've got a main load lock now on the high gain. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|You're loud and clear, Jack. It looks good he re.
|SC|Okay, Gordie. Let me keep going here. I did not turn the IR on cause I thought you said something. IR is going on now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, what I said is Roger, IR on.
|SC|Coming on. Mapping camera going in standby .
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by on the map camera.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 08:55 GET 84:02 MC-314/1
084:02:00|SC|Okay. I'm awaiting your cue for pan camera power, to power.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're still locking up on the data. We'll give you a cue.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, you have our cue for pan camera power to power.
|SC|Okay. Pan camera going to power. Okay, Gordo we're in the SIM BAY door jet attitude.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control 84 hours 6 minutes ground elapsed time. Present distance from the Moon —
|SC|Pan camera power is going to boost.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|Velocity 3763 feet per second. Next major maneuver is Lunar Orbit insertion, which presently is scheduled for 88 hours 54 minutes 22 seconds ground elapsed time. Total DELTA-V or change in velocity which will be retrograde of 2988 feet per second. Service propulsion system engine burn time of 6 minutes 38.08 seconds. Mother Earth is 206 059 nautical miles behind Apollo 17, and locked up on the high-gain antenna at this time so we should have fairly good communications all the way through the SIM BAY door jettison and until the spacecraft passes behind the Moon prior to the Lunar Orbit insertion maneuver, which now is some 4 hours and 37 minutes away, roughly. At 84:0 7 standing by live on air-to-ground this is Apollo Control.
|SC|No, down there.
|SC|No1J
|SC|. (Garble)
|SC|Houston, I'm in VOX now. Do you read? -
|CAPCOM|Yes sir. You're loud and clear.
|SC|Okay. I'm now 181 a logic power Main A, Main B circuit breakers are closed.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay. Logic power number 1 is going to jet, number 2 to jet. Standing by for your go Houston.
|CAPCOM|Okay. St andby .
|CAPCOM|America, you're GO to jet to SIM BAY door.
|SC|Okay, Jack let me know when you've got the camera ready.
|SC|Okay, Houston. You said we are GO to jett the SIM BAY door a little early, huh.
|CAPCOM|Well, standby (garble) we're backing down here. Stand by one second.
|SC|Okay1
|SC|No. I checked it at one (garble).
|SC|Might check it.
|CAPCOM|Okay America. Once again, you're GO to jett the door and you can do it early if you wish. 'm * .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 08:55 GET 84:02 MC-314/2
084:02:00|SC|Okay, Gordo. We'll do it on Ron's mark down there.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Hey Houston. This attitude - this attitude has the sun right into window 5. It's probably going to be on the lens of the camera. I'll - I'll try to shade it the best I can but I don't have an awful lot of hope for these pi c ture s .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I think we're probably stuck with it Jack, because we need to.be in this right attitude, for the clearance and -
|SC|Okay, SIM door jett 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, jett.
|SC|Ah, I got a good bang. Did you hear that? Houston, there it goes, I got it out the hatch window and it looks like it was a clean jet. It's rolling and pitching and yawing slightly. There's a lot of garbage that came out with it can you take a picture Gene?
|SC|(garble)
|SC|(garble) let me see it. Ah, laughter), you take a picture. Yeah, there it goes.
|SC|Hello Houston, how do you read?
|SC|It certainly -
|CAPCOM|(garble) Sounded good.
|SC|Okay. Did you get to where we got a clean jett.
|CAPCOM|That's right, Geno.
|CAPCOM|Sounds good.
|SC|Okay. The door's moving, the door's moving directly away from us, mostly rolling. And it looks like it was a very clean, clean separation.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|Boy we got a good bang out of it. You could hear that pyro going, I think. It's rotating at about 5, -about 1 revolution per 5 seconds.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And it's rotating, what about the long axis? Yeah. Rotating about the long axis.
|SC|Houston. The garbage that I said went with it was just a small amount of debris, I'm sure on the sealant pyro area. There was one, oh about a 4 foot length piece of oh, 1 or 2 in. tape- like material that also went out with it.
|CAPCOM|Roger Gene.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 08:55 GET 84:02 MC-314/3
084:02:00|SC|(Laughter) Okay. What do we'do with these</h5> logic power1switches. Don't they go back to OFF now?
|SC|Door jett's off then,
|SC|Okay. You going to deploy/retract on number 1.
|SC|Deploy/retract to number 2.
|SC|Fuel cell react valves are normal. I'm sort of glad we had1those in latch.
|SC|Yeah, me too, 'cause that's a pretty good bang
|CAPCOM|You've loaded the wrong pitch angle there in NOUN 22.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 09:09 CST 84:16 GET MC-315/1
084:16:00|SC|Well, I got 10 degrees loaded, that's what we've got copied down here in the change.
|CAPCOM|Maybe there's some mistake, let us check here, Gen o.
|SC|Okay, we got 320010 at 324 and before I go to maneuver, I'll roll right about 12 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Right call, Gene. Our error; you're right.
|SC|Thank you, sir.
|SC|Okay, and the UV spectrometer is going to go on h ere . Mark it ,
|CAPCOM|Roger. Mark the UV.
|SC|Okay, and the IR will be off on your cue.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, that'll be 12 or 15 minutes from n ow .
|SC|Okay, just give us a call.
|SC|Okay, the 100 watt 02 heater circuit breakers coming open.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SC|Okay, 02 heaters 1 and 2 going to auto, and 3 off.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, we'll wait until 50 past the hour and pick up the LM/CM Delta P; we're stirring .6.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That sounds good.
|SC|And we're in the process of maneuvering and I guess I'll start to see if I can't get you some biomed.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|I don't know whether you were watching the LMB on the door1jett, did you see a jett on my heartbeat?
|CAPCOM|Well, we'll check this data here, Jack*
|SC|I guess I was remembering erroneously 15's comment that it was very quiet, but I - of course Ron reminded me they were in1the suits.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, John Young was talking about the same thing here, but we'didn't see anything on your EKG.
|SC|How stable could you get?
|SC|And Houston, 17 here, mag Bravo, Bravo is indicating 20 -let's see - indicating 76 percent now, 76 percent full.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|SC|And, Gordo, we are watching the 8 ball.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're keeping an eye on it too.
|CAPCOM|Mike, we'd like the high gain to auto, please.
|SC|Okay, you've got it to auto, I think we may have made a new discovery about microphones up here.
|CAPCOM|Oh, Is that right, what's that?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 09:09 CST 84:16 GET MC-315/2
084:16:00|SC|Well, Gordy, it looks as if you could improve your voice quality by putting fingers over the end of the mike boom. At least that works on the intercom.
|CAPCOM|How about that?
|CAPCOM|Mike Houston, we're ready for the IR's to OFF.
|SC|Okay. IR's coming OFF. Mark it,
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 09:29 GET 84:36 MC-316/1
084:36:00|SC|Say, Gordy, whose operating in the trench tod ay ?
|CAPCOM|Okay. It's the LOI and Descent team, Presley Green and Deiterich.
|SC|Their a trio of musketeers if I ever heard one .
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|All they lack is a French accent.
|CAPCOM|A New York accent is about the best they c an do.
|SC|I wasn't going to exercise any value judgements Go rdy .
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston. I have a preliminary LOI Pad any time it's convenient.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. I was just checking to see if I could find the Moon and I still can't see it out there.

|AMERICA|Okay, Houston. You have it.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, this is America. How do you read the commander on biomed?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. I'll take a look here.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Looking at the 02 pressures we think maybe tank 3 isol valve got jarred closed. Would you check the barber pole over on panel 278. If it's barber pole, would you re-open the valve?
|AMERICA|Gordy, we checked that. I'll check it again but we checked it right after the jett. And Gordy, it's gray. Would you like me to cycle it?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack. Go ahead and cycle it open.

|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 85 hours 45 minutes ground elapsed time into the mission of Apollo 17. Presently 7900 nautical miles out from the Moon and approaching at 4009 feet per second. We're still about 3 hours and 8 minutes away from lunar orbit insertion manuever, which will place the Apollo 17 spacecraft into a 52 by a 170 nautical mile lunar orbit. Earlier today, Gene Cernan asked Mission Control for suggestions concerning his gas symptoms. A decision has been made for the flight surgeon to consult privately with Cernan to discuss these symptoms. There's no indication that this situation will have any effect on the progress of the mission. A summary of the conversation will be released shortly. Meanwhile, for distance back to earth, Mother Earth stands some 208 068 nautical miles behind Apollo 17. We have 2 hours and 56 minutes remaining until the first loss of signal as Apollo 17 passes behind the Moon. 3 hours and 7 minutes and 50 seconds until ignition on the lunar orbit insertion maneuver, which presently is scheduled for a ground elapsed time of 88:54:22. Total burn time on the SPS engine of 6 minutes 38 seconds, for a total velocity change in retrograde of 2988 feet per second. At 85:47 ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control 85 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. Here in the Control Center, the Flights Dynamics Officer Jay Green, just passed up to the Flight Director Neil Hutchinson, the latest predicted figures for the S-IVB impact. The present predictions on time are for the S-IVB to impact at ground elapsed time of 89 hours 39 minutes 43.4 seconds. The coordinates of the impact are predicted to be 4.12 degrees south latitude by 12.22 degrees west longitude. 3 hours and 3 minutes to lunar orbit insertion ignition. 2 hours 51 minutes until Apollo 17 passes behind the Moon for the first time. Distance from the Moon, presently 7653 nautical miles, velocity ever increasing, now 4032 feet per second. At 85:51 ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17, this is Apollo Con t ro 1.

085:52:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston, we've lost the high gain and data. Go on OMNI ALPHA.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Those lines - go OMNI ALPHA.
|CAPCOM|America, this is Houston. How do you copy?
|SC|Clear, and we're OMNI ALPHA. If you don't answer this transmission, we'll try the high gain again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We're reading you now. I heard you say OMNI ALPHA. Say again, the first part.
|SC|Roger. We've been reading you. I think you're on VHF however. Would you like us to reacquire high gain?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. I'll check on that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to try the high gain at a PITCH of minus 29, YAW at 17, manual and wide.
|SC|Okay, Gordie, we're on the high gain.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SC|How do you read?
|CAPCOM|I'm reading you - I can read you, but there's still a lot of background noise.
|SC|Like VHF would sound, but I'm not sure I be- le i ve it.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we just commanded normal voice.
|SC|Gordie, do you think you can hook up some how out of normal voice?
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'd like you to try a normal acquisi tion. Go AUTO and narrow on the high gain..
|SC|Okay, that peaked it up, AUTO and narrow.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're loud and clear now.
|SC|Okay, Gordie. You said that you had to command normal voice. Did we get a spurious command in there some way.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'did all that ourselves to establish voice through Ascension, no problem. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordie. How did you reach us when you finally started calling?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'didn't do anything to cause the problem there, we were uplinking through Madrid and downlinking through Ascension. Did you see anything onboard that could have caused the loss a lock?
|SC|No, sir. We had good signal strength. It wasn't peaked for the high gain. It was more like an OMNI signal strength about 70 percent. And we called you several times after the switch in lines, and then finally, you came through, clear, but with some background noise and sounded like VHF. I presume it wasn't, now. And when you called, I went to OMNI ALPHA, with no change in signal strength, still about 70 percent, and you were still coming up the same way, and apparently, didn't hear us. And then the high gain - with high gain acquisition, it's been pretty clear.

|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Houston there, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Gordo, just an interesting observation. All the air bubbles in the beverage packs - you know none of the air bubbles will come together at all. If you get it in a small air bubble it stays in a small air bubble. And they'll never -

|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Well, that must be a - what - you know talking about a sliver of the Moon, that is a sliver of a sliver. Gordo, we're coming in right down on top of it. What's our perigee did you say? Should be 73 miles.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's about right. Don t worry, you'll miss it.- t
|SC|I just want to hear you say it cause I'm going to hold you to it. As long as you shadow your eyes from the Sun - the Sun is just about laying on the horizon of the Moon and as a matter of fact, as I watch it I can watch the horizon - the amount of - of daylight terminator get larger.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordy, unless I'm proven wrong here, I think we'll be able to watch it all the way in as long as we can keep the shadows from the Sun.

086:49:00|SC|Gordy, it's a sight to remember. Not just because of the uniqueness of the view, but because we all have got to ask ourselves if we really know where we are and what we're really looking at right at this moment and when you answer that question, it's yes, it certainly becomes an epic sight in your mind.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|My congratulations to the trench for solving another rendezvous - rendezvous problem.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Gordy, can you tell us how far we are right now from the ah - from the Moon?
|CAPCOM|Surely can, stand by,
|CAPCOM|Right now, you're about 5000 miles from th e s urf ace.
|SC|17 .
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|I think I got a visual on the SIM BAY door now out window five. It's just about directly off our present plus Y axis.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Must be way out there by now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordy, what's the MOCR having for dinner this Sunday?
|CAPCOM|Well, let's see. I guess we haven't sent out for hamburgers, yet. There's a few brown bags in sight but that's about it.
|SC|Gordy, it doesn't look like I'll have a chance to go to church today, but under the circumstances I guess it'll be okay. Next time you see the good Father, you might have him put a good word in for us.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I'll do that.
|SC|Gordy, is - in our present attitude I see the lip of the Moon convex down toward our minus X axis. That's out of the hatch window. Can you tell me which is the north and which is the south pole?
|CAPCOM|Okay. Stand by.
|SC|Yeah, I'd be all squared away if the Moon were on Jack's side. Because he's got that end on his head, but, I'm a little mixed up now.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I understand your problem.
|SC|Gordy. I'm thinking the top of the LM towards the Sun, is probably the north.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Gordy, I think I got it. The north has got to be on the right as I look at the lip of the Moon
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 11:42 GET 86:49 MC-323/2
086:49:00|SC|opposite the sun, because when we go into retrograde attitude - ahh, it's got to be over there. I think I can see Korolev without any problem. It's a little bit nortli of the equator.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordy, are you still with us?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, I'm with you.
|CAPCOM|I'm getting lots of advice here.
|SC|Okay - - Okay. I bet you are. But, I think I've got it oriented. You can literally watch yourself fall down in. As we get closer, if we're going to have a view like this, it's going to be pretty dramatic, because we're calling the way you climb on out of the Moon when you leave it. If you can see, and I remember remarks at that time, Gee if we could see it like this when we came back in, we'd have to close our eyes. If we can see this thing coming in like I think we may be able to see it, at 50 miles it isn't going to look like very much .
|CAPCOM|Roger. We agree - -
|SC|Considering the window - . Gordy we're considering - -
|SC|Gordy we're considering putting the window covers on.
|CAPCOM|Your chickens, huh.
|SC|It's going to be one of those high angle energy conversion round outs.
|CAPCOM|Rog. From our information here, if you're looking at the Moon so that the, the dark limb is up, then North should be to the right.
|SC|Yeah, I concurred that's the way it is.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The horizon is just steadily growing bigger.
|CAPCOM|Does it look about the same as last time?
|SC|What do you mean last time? A couple of years ago?
|CAPCOM|Right,
|SC|Gordy, we never saw it coming in a couple of years ago. We saw it, as I recall, a day out and we saw just a shadow of the limb, but we - From my best recollection, we never saw it this close. As a matter of fact, we went into darkness prior to going into LOI and this time, much to my amazement, we'don't. But, I see now that we won't and I see why.
|SC|I'll tell you, everyone whose seen that view leaving, knows how fast you climb out and by golly, the closer we get to it the faster we're coming in.

087:14:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 87 hours 16 minutes ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Some 1 hour and 38 minutes until ignition on lunar orbit insertion. Presently, the spacecraft is 4243 nautical miles away from the Moon. The Moon is getting larger, as noted by the crew. They considered closing the window shades in the spacecraft. Velocity now 4544 feet per second. Some numbers on acquisition of the spacecraft. With the burn -a normal burn, the acquisition on the east limb of the Moon would be at 89 hours 16 minutes 29 seconds. Without a burn, it would be somewhat sooner, 89 hours 7 minutes 46 seconds. A private conversation was conducted with the Apollo 17 crew from ground elapsed time of 85:46:55 to 86:04:46. The subject of the conversation was Gene Ce man's request for suggestions concerning alleviating some gas symptoms he had had during the flight. The following is a summary of the conversation. The call to the crew was made by Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations. Dr. Royce Hawkins, Chief of Medical Operations at MSC asked Cernan to explain his symptoms, Cernan reported it was no great problem, but that he has had some greater gas discomfort then his fellow crewmembers. He said he felt quite fine at this time, and there was never any pain or nausea associated with the discomfort. Cernan advised Dr. Hawkins of the anti-gas medication, symethocone, he'd been taking. Dr. Hawkins recommended to Cernan that he continue the medication after meals and before going to sleep. Hawkins also advised Cernan on some changes to his menu over the next 2 days to reduce the discomfort. Cernan reported quote "I'm better, there's nothing detrimental or incapacitating about this; we're all in good shape. We hope things are looking as good down there as they are up here." close quote. Lunar Module pilot Harrison Schmitt reported the crew had encountered some difficulty with the onboard system that separates gas bubbles from the drinking water supply. Schmitt was advised that the gas separator system has given the crews problems on previous Apollo flights. Astronaut John Young Commander of the Apollo 16 mission, and Back-up Commander for Apollo 17, also, talked briefly to the Astronauts, and wished them well. Distance now 4125 nautical miles from the Moon. Velocity 4570. Still an hour and 35 minutes, mark, until ignition on lunar orbit insertion burn. At 87:19, this is Apollo Control.
|SC|Gordo - The widest - most part of the convex horizon probably covers a good couple of degrees. I can now see relief on the horizon itself against the dark s p ace.

I can see even more definite relief now on the horizon just to the north and behind Korolev. On the black horizon against space.

Towards us you can - you can get the feeling that the horizon — the lighted portion of the horizon definitely does flow in our direction.

|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston, we just had a site handover. That resulted in the LOS time changing 19 seconds. It's now 43:21.-
|SC|Okay, 43:21 and we are on OMNI Charlie.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And, just to round out things as we pitch back into LOI1attitude, low and behold from over the top of the LM came the Earth.
|CAPCOM|Very good.
|SC|Got the whole thing in one big package.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 13:07 CST 88:14 GET MC-328/1
088:14:00|SC|Pretty interesting, Gordo, we can - we can see we're right over South America and, of course, we can see up the Gulf Coast. And it looks like Houston is covered with clouds, but poetically enough, we can see the Cape, at least we can see Florida.
|CAPCOM|How about that.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 88 hours 17 minutes into the mission of Apollo 17. Some 26 minutes now until Apollo 17 passes behind the Moon, coming up on the lunar orbit insertion ^ burn in which the spacecraft will start its initial orbit measuring 52 nautical miles by 170 nautical miles, an elliptical orbit around the Moon. That maneuver will take place at a ground elapsed time of 88 hours 54 minutes into the flight, and will slow the spacecraft down considerably from its present velocity of some 5700 feet per second. Presently, the Apollo 17 spacecraft is 1528 nautical miles out from the Moon, approaching at 5730 feet per second. After the spacecraft passes behind the Moon 25 minutes from now, assuming as successful lunar orbit insertion burn, it should come from behind the east face of the Moon, the limb of the Moon, at approximately 33 minutes later. It'll take a few moments for the ground stations to lock up on the downlink from the spacecraft even though the theoretical contact time is roughly 33 minutes after loss of signal. At 88 hours 18 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
|SC|Now VERB 41 NOUN 91, and I'm on VOX now. (Garble) commander's flight.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you're loud and clear on VOX.

|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, let's go ahead and go and do that P40. 22 - about 20 minutes. Well, it looks like it's going pretty close to where we want to be anyhow.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Just back the other way.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, we're standing by in P40.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're watching you.

|CAPCOM|Very good.
|PAO| This is Apollo Control at 88 hours 43 minutes into the Mission of Apollo 17. We have had loss of signal as Apollo 17 coasted behind the Moon on the start of the first lunar orbit, 10 minutes and 28 seconds away from lunar orbit insertion maneuver. A retrograde service propulsion system burn of some 2988 feet per second. Assuming a successful burn, the spacecraft should come out from behind the Moon at 89:16:29 ground elapsed time as Gene Cernan promised it would before they went behind the Moon. At loss of signal, the spacecraft was some 395 miles above the surface of the Moon, traveling at a velocity of 7241 feet per second. 9 minutes and 30 seconds - mark, until LOI ignition. At 88:44 and returning just before acquisition of signal, as Apollo 17 comes from behind the Moon, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 14:08 GET 89:15 MC 330/1
089:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 89 hours, 15 minutes ground elapsed time. Some 55 seconds until Apollo 17 comes from behind the Moon, on the start of the first Lunar Orbit. We're awaiting appearance of the spacecraft and word that the burn went successful, which apparently it has because the spacecraft without a burn would have appeared some 8 minutes ago. The ignition time Is 88:54:21 in ground elapsed time. Should be getting lock on fairly soon, zero. That was the theoretical acquisition time. Of course, it does take a few seconds for the ground station to lock onto the signal from the spacecraft. We're awaiting word from the communications officer that we have indeed gotten a signal and telemetry from the spacecraft.
|SC|Okay (unaudible).
|SC|Yeah, it's (garble). Well, yeah it is. There's AOS limits right there - -
|SC|I think we just passed Hertz's -
|CAPCOM|Hello, there, America. We hear you talking.

|SC|There.
|SC|The time.
|SC|Yeah, we're at the edge of Marginis
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Here in the Control Center we are hearing the crew aboard the spacecraft of Apollo 17 very clearly, however the ground has not be able to fully lock up on the spacecraft with the so-called uplink, on the voice uplink. And apparently it has to do with the 85 foot antenna at Goldstone. We're continuing to stand by until the 2-way communications are complete. An hour and 20 minutes before loss of signal as we go across the face of the Moon, the front face of the Moon on the first Lunar Orbit. At 89:20 and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
|SC|Okay. It came in then.
|SC|There it goes.
|SC|Hello.
|CAPCOM|Hello America, how do you read, Houston. Over.
|SC|America - Houston, this is America you can breathe easier, America has arrived on station for the Challenge ah e a d.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 14:08 GET 89:15 MC-330/2
089:15:00|CAPCOM|Very good. We've been hearing you for a couple of minutes now. We've had a ground site problem, but you're loud and clear now.
|SC|Okay. That's what we sort of thought, Gordo. The SPS burn could not have been more nominal. I've got some numbers for you if you're ready to copy.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, TIG was on time, TIG was on time, burn time was 6 plus 33, VG is 29899, Roll was 008, Pitch 357, Yaw 006, all at the end of the burn. Residuals minus .3, plus .1, and 0. Delta VC was minus 6.8, oxidizer 34.0, fuel 34.5, unbalance is 110, decrease. The CMC holds us in a 170.3, by 52.5.
|CAPCOM|That sounds great Gene.
|SC|It was an auto ignition. It was an auto shutdown. I think any comments during the burn are on the tape. But, to me, it was probably the smoothest and quietest SPS burn I ever remember.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Houston this is Jack. The PUGS was erratic, and the only thing that I noticed that was off nominal. It - It bounced around a lot, in bouncing around — it was initially for about a minute around oh, 1.8 decrease, then it gradually started to divert from that to a more decrease down to about 2.5 or make that 3 decrease. And I went to decrease on the switch and about the time of cross over, I had it at oh about 1 decrease and it crossed over and stabilized at zero and I went to normal and it stayed there the rest of the burn. Until just near the end it started to go decrease again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that Jack.
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|Okay, Gordo, did you by any chance get the S-IVB impact?
|CAPCOM|Ah, we're - Okay, the new impact time for that is 89:39, so we haven't quite got there yet.
|SC|Okay. Thank you.
|SC|And, Houston, Ron here. I think a little bit of a surprise to me when I turned on bank-A the chamber pressure came up to 87 percent, and stayed there esentially. Five seconds later I put on bank B the chamber pressure rose to a 90 -about 91 or somewhere in that area. And then, throughout the burn chamber pressure increased which you'll see on the strip chart. But I was sure surprised that only 87 percent when we started it. It looked like the velocity gained versus time was correct throughout the burn, though. The maximum the chamber pressure ever got to was about 97 percent, and that was toward the end of the burn.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|(Garble) .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 14:18 CST 89:25 GET MC 331/1
089:25:00|SC|A little disappointed here, Gordo, I brought an airborne and a1ground geologist along with me and it took him until AOS to make1sure they knew where we were.
|SC|Ha ha. That's not true.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|My big problem was all the holes were hills when I first started. Looked just like you had the picture upside down1t
|CAPCOM|Roger. I have a couple pan camera photo PAD s for you.
|SC|Go ahead, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the first one goes in the Flight Plan at 90:45, and the start time is 090 50 32. Stop time is 091 10 57. Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, I got 090 50 32 and 091 10 57.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and next one goes on the next page. Start time is 091 18 05. Stop time is 091 27 43.
|SC|911805912 743.
|CAPCOM|That's right.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, I've turned the pan camera off there about 30 seconds ago and the post-SPS burn checks are complete. Logic - no, that's, well, just a minute. The post-SPS burns are complete down to a logic power 2. That'11 avoid Retract. I m not sure of Flight Plan.
|SC|Okay, Mode is stand by. Mark it. Power is on on the pan camera. Okay, Houston, we're waiting your cue on the power.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and add they'll be no update to the TEI burn PAD. Over.
|SC|Beautiful.
|SC|(Garble) Here's Smidley, gang, coming over mare - no, let's see, Crisium. Coming over Crisium. It's coming underneath us now.
|SC|I will have in a jiffy. Okay, I'm going to hang off then a little bit. Get a - boy, this window. And, Gordo, how did the spacecraft look to you as we came around.
|CAPCOM|Real good, Geno. Nothing to report.
|SC|Very fine. Thank you.
|SC|(Laughter) One little minor problem, Gordy, is that we're breathing so hard that the windows are fogging up on the inside for a change.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we'd like the pan camera power on now. The1pan camera on, good.
|SC|Be auti ful.
|SC|Oh boy, there is Picard, or Peirce, one of the two.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 14:18 CST 89:25 GET MC-331/2
089:25:00|SC|Okay, Gordy, all those dark and light albedo changes around Picard and Peirce are not obvious at this particular angle yet. There's some hint of them.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The rim - is there one farther south of Peirce?
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|Is the one farterest - Picard, yeah. Picard, I think, is the one I'm looking at.
|SC|Yeah, it is.
|PAO|Mark 8 minutes to S-IVB impact.
|SC|Behind the rendezvous antenna. Rendezvous radar. And - yeah, way out there, you ought to start seeing them.
|SC|I guess I ought to get that other stuff on the camera, huh?
|SC|Okay, we're just about over the top of Picard, and the rim materials which go out about a third of a crater in diameter as near as I can tell, are distinctly darker but not by much. They're more grey, really, then the grey tan, or tanis grey of the rest of the mare.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Now we assume you're all set up or about to get that way for the landing site photos.
|SC|Yes sir. There is no obvious ray pattern or secondary pattern outside of that blanket around Picard.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I see no loops or obvious alignment that would be related to that crater. There are blocks - look like great big blocky areas on the rim.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, some 6 minutes 13 seconds away from S-IVB impact. The traces, seismograph traces from Apollo 14 and Apollo 16 will be visible in the news room video monitors. There will be a briefing in the small briefing room on the seismology of the impact. Some 5 minutes 43 seconds now away from S-IVB predicted impact.
|SC|Do they want the 80 millimeter lens on these terminators now.
|SC|There's Taruntius, Ron.
|SC|Yeah, I guess that's right.
|SC|I've got to get another magazine on it.

|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, in about 5 minutes, all right.
|AMERICA|Gordy, you'd be interested - there's a crater that just on - on the west rim of Crisium. Relatively fresh rim - fairly crisp rim - but no strong ray pattern. There's no ray pattern apparent at all. It looks like it's pre - the plains material around it - that - since they come right up over the - right up to the edge of the crater in one spot. That is Posidonius. That's right. That's what I'm looking at.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Not Posidonius, Procolus. That's what I'm des cribing.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, all right, you're looking where?

|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, you can even see the horizon in the Earth shine out there.
|SC|Boy, you sure can. You can see an Earth lit horizon out there into the dark part of the Moon.
|SC|Can you see lightening side. I think it's going to be in the darkness.
|SC|The shadows are so contrasting here, Ron that I -
|SC|Give me that thing a minute.
|SC|I told you. There's le Monnier the landing side. I can't - no it's just dark. Isn't it a little north of (garble).
|SC|No, I think it's right below us, Jack. I think it's right smack below us in darkness.
|SC|Yes, it is. I think I'm looking at Littrow right there right below us. But, I can't quite tell.
|SC|If I could see Macrobius I'd have a better handle on it.
|CAPCOM|A reminder to go to S-IV and 1250 this time on the last six pictures.
|SC|Roger. That's Posidonius alright. Le Monnier, we're here early.
|SC|Boy, I tell you, there's no question that right at the terminator you pick up relief that you normally would not believe is there in the mare. I remember Bill Anders talking about the appearance of a sea swell in the mare itself and that's certainly clearly shown right at the terminator. Unless you start to see the shadows from all the very small craters that other wise don't show up as much more than little depressions, if that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we need accept so we can give you a landing REFSMMAT.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 14:28 GET 89:35 332/3

|SC|Okay, Houston. I cheated. I took three extra pictures and those were at 28 in the 250 up at the end.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SC|And, your times might have been a little off because I was just about ready to loose the terminator because of the maneuver - are we maneuvering or have we?
|SC|Ye s.
|SC|But, I think we've got a good set going up to the terminator.

|SC|(garble)
|SC|Yeah, enough tourist activity.
|SC|Warm in here, isn't it?
|CAPCOM|America, a couple of items. Would you verify the S-band AUX TV switches in the science position. And one other thing, we think you were in low bit rate during the burn.
|SC|Okay, it's in science and we very definitely were in high bit rate during the burn by the checklis t.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we may have a problem there because it looks like low to us on the data. We'll check further.
|SC|Hey, Gordy, there was - Ron questioned - brought up the question or possibility of not having gone to command reset, but just before we left you, you'll probably be able to see that I went command reset and turned on the tape cause I remember seeing the tape motion.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We're discussing it - what happened there.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, you can go back to VOX.
|SC|Okay, Houston. How do you read 17?
|CAPCOM|You're loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Okay, before we really got concentrat ing on the burn, and I had an opportunity to - we all had an opportunity to look at Korolevb, at a very low grazing sun, one of the striking things was the - to me was the extreme absence of relief, the very smooth surface that existed in Korolev, independent of course, of the craters that are penetrating that surface. It looked like there was a ring in the floor next to the wall about maybe 1/6 of a crater radius that was somewhat brighter at the low grazing sun, suggesting it may have had a different slope. And I believe I'm correct in saying that the inner floor may be slightly raised. We'll try to make other observations this next time around on that one, but there was just a very smooth floor, the light plains material in that crater is very smooth.
|CAPCOM|Okay, understand. One quick word from FAO's (garble) film watchers here.
|SC|And of course that's independent - -
|CAPCOM|Has to do with optional photographs. We'd rather you take the optional photographs on either, 00 or PP and reserve KK for the scheduled photographs. And as it stands now, we've got to reserve 80 frames on -either 00 or PP for scheduled photography. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 14:38 GET 89:45 333/2
089:45:00|SC|Okay, you have to keep track of that. We need, I was hoping we had an optional capability on our first Rev and we'll work it out.
|CAPCOM|we'do, we just want to put them on 00.
|SC|(garbled)
|CAPCOM|That's right, just put them on 00.
|CAPCOM|Jack, the problem on the high and low bit rate there was a syncronization problem between you the burn check and us on the ground on our pre LOS command. No hardware problems, and I don't think it will be a problem in the future.
|SC|Okay. But you did loose the high bit rate Is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. We just had low bit rate during the burn.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 89:55 CST 14:48 MC334/1
089:55:00|SC|Okay, I may have jumped the gun on you there a little bit, but, I thought we were suppose to do that just before we went AOS , LOS. I think I did it about a mmute before.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It was almost identical, simultaneous with our sending the command. You've got about 4 minutes to start looking at Copernicus coming here.
|SC|Okay. Thank you. We're just. Sun's just setting.
|SC|Okay, I have a visual on Copernicus.
|CAPCOM|And, by the way, the S-IVB crunched in on time and it's been ringing the ALSEP seismometers like mad for some time now.
|SC|VOX, and that's VOX. How do you read the LMP, G o r dy ?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Thank you, Okay, good. Allright I've got a visual on Eratosthenes and Copernicus. The, they're are obviously different age craters in this light. You can see the ray patterns in Copernicus moderately well. You can even tell that they do cross Eratosthenes. Stadius shows up as a very clear dark area to the southwest of Eratosthenes. Now, one of the things that we mapped on the southeast and south rim of Copernicus were dark albedo areas within the ejecta. And those are apparent, here very clearly. And also, within, on the upper portion of the rim and on the benches, in that quadrant, the walls, there are the dark spot lower albedo material that we mapped. They are, ... form linear patterns along the benches apparently. Although, the topography is not too clear, but the dark spots are in arcuate and linear arrangement, parallel to the rim. And they appear to have be elongate along radius. Along the radius of the crater.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|This is in the southeast, southeast quadrant I'm referring to. Copernicus H is also very obvious as a dark rimmed crater, relative to the albedo or the ejecta blanket. And the northwest quadrant, which we mapped as a smooth floor material and somewhat darker albedo is just as apparent here, although all the contrasts, of course, are less. The main thing that you can pick out in earthshine are albedo distinctions. Now, now we, I remember that we also at one time, and I can't remember whether it made the final map or not, mapped an arcuate fall structure, based on the change in albedo. And this was on the southwest quadrant of Copernicus. And that across the southern rim, more or less north/south, went down and curved across the floor and up the southwest rim, and that is a very clear arcuate pattern in this lighting. Darker albedo than the rest of the crater, and along the arc, there appear to be a couple or three even darker spots. Much as we thought we saw in some of the early photography.

089:55:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|There is a general streaking, radial streaking, withing that arcuate dark area, that radiates, radially from the crater, and if I had to project, the dark area would, north, whose northeast terminus is the arc in the crater, I'd project it off to southeast about crater diameter and a half, maybe. Now, we're getting, essentially directly overhead, and again the dark spots within the crater wall are still apparent and the streaming or the radial elongation of these spots is clear. Now, on the lower wall, that's below the first bench, I can see four of these dark areas, and on the next wall above that, above the first bench, there are two, two obvious ones, and a couple that are somewhat more subtle.
|CAPCOM|Okay. (garble) about in the Central Peak?
|SC|No, Gordy, I can't. There's very little in dication of relief in earthshine and particularly at this high Sun angle, high Earth angle. Pardon the expression.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The Central Peaks do stand out, though, as a much lighter albedo area within the crater. It looks to me like the best thing you can do in earthshine is work with albedos. Knowing the general topography from the, from the earlier photography. We're coining up on Kepler, now. Copernicus is out of my view in window 5. Maybe Ron sees it. Do you Ron.
|SC|No, it's out of my view now too.
|SC|Okay, we, we. . .
|SC|Can you see Reinhold over there?
|SC|Reinhold, I was not conscious of, yes, I can see Reinhold. Reinhold is one of the craters just like Copernicus that may have contributed ejectas in the Apollo 12 files. You see 
|SC|And S-IVB, yes 16's S-IVB hit out there to the south, I think.
|SC|Well, I don't see anything that would indicate that.
|SC|Reinhold is an (garble) aged crater, as you may recall. It's crossed very obviously, even in this light, by the Copernican rays, which is prime, the main way we'determine the age, other than it doesn't have any rays itself. Although, on the good photography we now have, we know it has secondary crater patterns around It.
|SC|You're not looking at the same crater I am then .
|SC|Reinhold is right down here Geno.
|SC|Where are you looking?
|SC|Well, it's south of Copernicus.
|SC|Okay, I'm looking up here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 89:55 CST 14:48 MC334/3
089:55:00|SC|South and a little west.
|SC|I don't have the same view you have, gq1Okay, I can see LansbeTg now. And I'm afraid I can't shed any light, pardon the expression, on the old question we've had about the age of Lansberg, relative to the Mare.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 14:58 GET 90:05 MC335/1
090:05:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Kepler Ray pattern Is very striking in this light and the (garble) series of bands which only average being radial. In most cases they're a little off the radial,' but by joining together, they give you a general radial pattern. I just want to see a — okay, out the window 4 I have an excellent view of Kepler. Once again, albedo differences, such as the — are very clear — such as the distinction between the wall light — or brighter wall materials, and the rim, which in itself, is brighter than the surround mare. We can look right down some of the rays, and the rays are not completely linear. I'm looking now to the northwest. Gene, you could see Aristarchus way up there in the northwest. See it? SP1Yeah (garble)
|SC|You ought to have a good view of Aristarchus. Very bright up in the northwest part of our field of view.
|SC|The inside of that crater almost looks as if it's backlit.
|SC|That's right. Well, it should be. Strangely enough .
|SC|And, but -- these rays with contrast to the - maybe the feeling one would have that they are -- once they get started, they form a linear pattern across the surface. They don't seem to have done that. 1 As a matter of fact, they're quite strikingly curved along their pattern. They'll break from the general radius they're out on, curve away and then curve back. Some all let's see, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 rays that go from out -- to the northwest of Kepler, all of which show that -nonlinear characteristic.
|SC|Yeah, they're all radial, though.
|SC|They are radial, in general, but when you look at them in detail, only portions of them are radial, and a single ray which you could follow continuously, will bend then curve back.
|SC|The — it's unique. We've got rays from — I guess those must be Copernicus over here -- those long ones off to the right, which you might not be able to see. Kepler and Reiner are all intermingling up here.
|SC|Yeah, this is the area now we're going over where the gamma ray work on 15 indicated a relatively high radioactivity. And -- not yet, it's -- (garble)
|SC|Houston, America here. Do you see the torque and angle?
|SC|I was going to look for the Hortensian Domes near Copernicus,1but got sidetracked with Kepler and missed them.
|CAPCOM|(garbled) Ron.
|SC|They are not obvious, though, in looking in the gen — Okay,1our torque 845.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 14:58 GET 90:05 MC335/2
090:05:00|SC|Okay, we're getting out into Procellarum — Oceanus Procellarum proper now, and before long, should pick up the medial ridge that makes that mare so distinctive from the other mare. This is a ridge that stretches something like 2000 kilometers north to south, if you want to tie a vari — a number of things together. And, probably is the lun — the Moon's1. closest analogy to an oceanic ridge, which has — which have been in the news oyer the last decade.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Once again, the topography of the Procellarum Mare is not clear in this light. It's just not quite enough light to give you strong, distinct shadows. At least, not yet at this Earth angle.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and as you get the camera set up for the orbital science pictures of Galois with — on a change, and use Magazine 00 instead of KK. That's listed in the flight plan at 9020.
|SC|Okay, we'll do that.
|SC|Okay, out of the window 4, I'm able to see some of the Rima gamma materials, and it's awful hard to say more than just the fact there is a very clear light-colored pattern off to the north. Of our position, at any rate. I think all I can say is that I've seen it. I can't give you much information on it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|We can see the area where Maurius Hills should be, although it's not an obvious topographic feature in this light. Still see Aristarchus off up there shining like a star, if the Moon could have stars.
|SC|Okay, Houston. I'm going to torque those course line errors out at 12.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|And — You squared away?
|SC|It's good to be able to see some stars out of the telescope. It's the first time I've been able to see any.
|SC|Gordie, we have a very clear zero phase point for the Earth light. It's certainly not a strong contrast for the Sun, but it's out there, and within it, again, the French craters tend to brighten quite a bit more than the surrounding mare. Still looking at Oceanus Procellarum. And, now, out Window 3, up to the northwest, Grimaldi is starting to show up. A very obvious dark area within the highlands of that part of the Moon. And, one of the darkest mare regions that we have seen on the Moon. It's comparable, at least in the photographs, to that of Tsiolkovsky. Normally, of course, we think of the dark mare as being the younger basalt flows on the Moon, but in our case, of course, young means something on the order of three billion years or older.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/l0/72 CST 14:58 GET 90:05 MC335/3
090:05:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|For our interp — If we can extrapolate from the samples returned by other missions. It's amazing how far over -- you know the highlands to the west of Procellarum are still are bright, and the contrast between fresh craters and the normal highlands are very obvious still in Earth light. Particularly, along the zero phase point with respect to the Earth.
|SC|Rima Gamma now is coming a little bit closer to our oval track in the horseshoe in the larger and more western end of it; the dark horseshoe is quite clear in this light. It's a west or northwest pointing horseshoe. As is the complete trend of that strange feature. I think Ron is going to have an excellent change to study these light-colored swirls within the mare and other parts of the Moon. We had some good views of them and Mare Marginus —
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 15:08 CST 90:15 GET 336/1
090:15:00|SC|very marginous and to the east of Mare Crisium, if there is anything to be seen, he should be able to see it during the next few days.
|CAPCOM|Rog Jack.
|SC|Say, Gordo, something I just noticed here in working with the GDCs we're having, I looked at the PC gage and at a PD, PC position, why there is a continuous bias on it now of about, oh, 7 percent and if I switch to ALPHA it goes to zero. We never saw that bias before this last burn.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Hey, Gordy, I'm looking right up the western edge of the Procellarum Mare where it contacts the western highlands of the Moon and we're just about to fly a little bit south of Grimaldi. That edge is very irregular. There is no obvious indication that it, there are large basins that have been flooded by mare that have formed that edge and but again the topographic distinctions possible in this lighter fall. Now I'm starting to see that there are shadows in the craters.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|That's the small craters. There in the Mare Procellarum closest to Grimaldi there are two arcuate rilles. Look like they are probably V -shaped in their cross section. I'm sure we've seen those on the photograph much better than I can see them here. Those rille patterns though do seem to project over into the Highlands.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|To the north of that, to the north of that Bay of Mare .
|SC|Just interrupt. Hey, I just saw a flash on the lunar surface.
|CAPCOM|Ah, I,
|SC|It was just out there north of Grimaldi. Just north of Grimaldi. You might see if you got anything on your seismometers. Although a small impact probably would give a fair amount of visible light.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll check.
|SC|It was a bright little flash right out there near that crater. See the crater right at the edge of Grimaldi. Then there is another one north of it. Fairly sharp one north of it. It's where, there was just a thin streak of light.
|CAPCOM|How about putting an X on the map where you s aw it.
|SC|I keep looking occasionally for --- Yeah, we will. I was planning on looking for those kind of things. -Starting to see the edge ofOrientale, Gordy. Way off to the gQ1Gordy, to the north of Grimaldi there is a large basin that is about the same size but only incompletely filled with a mare in its northeastern quandrant. The rest of it looks like a fairly irregular and hummocky floor materia of some kind. But it's almost the same size as Grimaldi. It even looks like it is a little bit deeper. But, of course, Grimaldi has considerable fill. Grimaldi on its eastern^edge has some of the grobbens, or it's a rim, if you will, it s cut by three or four anestomozy grobbens. Make it look like some of the midge areas in the larger basins. Okay, the first ring of Orientale is showing up. The next ring in is extremely obvious, got some very bright east facing slopes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 15:08 CST 90:15 GET 336/2
090:15:00|CAPCOM|I'll turn off the innercom.
|SC|It has some very bright east facing slopes and you can see the bands of Mare that are filling the, both the first bench area and the inner bench. Any time you need us, Gordy, just interrupt me.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll do that.
|SC|Now, as I look north along the first bench, that's the first bench from the out side, one inside the Cordillerian ring, better check that. I may have my names mixed up. Got a ring caller? Handy. Seat. Shou be on there. Yeah, this is what I need. What s the name -they got a name on that - ridge, there? Ah, that s Rook Mountains. Yeah, the Cordillerian. Yeah, that s right and looking just west of the Cordillera in the first bench as I look north in this light which is casting some shadows now Gordy, over in here it looks extremely smooth. Now this is not mare, it's lighter albedo, lighter reflectivity then the mare and, although there are patches of mare here in the lower areas in it. But looking along that plain, in fact a large - long linear plain, it looks quite smooth with only some very broad undulations that appear to be roughly radial to Orientale itself. The closer we get to it the more I see minor relief showing up. I start to see the shadows, I guess. And that relief seems to bring out a hummocky texture in addition to the craters you would expect to see there.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I won't try to give you a trend on the hummocks because. I think the shadows are biasing my view and they do appear to be north south trending but I think that is because of the shadow pattern. This is a spectacular you guys, you ought to take a look at Orientale. One o t e largest fresh basins on the Moon. It still is probably ^ 4 billion years old, or 3.8 at any rate, if our dating criteria are any good. It has the outer cordillerian ring and the inner ring called the Rook Mountains. Very, very nicely shown. They are massive. On that inner ring, the Rook Mountain ring, there are massive complexes much like what we'll be studying at Taurus Littrow. There are low areas non-mare areas that are comparable to the Taurus Valley that we'll be landing in. And all in all I think we'll find that our ring in the Taurus Littrow area around Serenitatis
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 90:25 CST 15:18 MC337/1
090:25:00|SC|Pitatus is comparable in many regards to this Rrook Mountain ring around Orientale. You want, - did you interrupt Gordy?
|CAPCOM|No. I didn't say anything.
|SC|Okay, I thought I heard your key. Okay, in the inner portion of Orientale, as we approach a terminator, the lighting is still excellent. As a matter of fact, it appears brighter than what we were looking at over at Copernicus. Now, part of that may be, we're seeing much sharper relief since the slow earth-gacing slopes are nicely lit, and the backfacing slopes, of course, are in shadow. The first portion of the bench inside the Rook Mountains is partially filled by mare. Now, the higher land in there is very smooth, in a gross sense, it's a very smooth hummocky terrain, cut by roughly circumfrential grabens. The trend of the hummock, themselves, are not radial, they're more, well, they're about a 45 degree angle to the radius. They, in detail, have a much finer hackly texture, much like we've been able to see on photographs before. And, in general, you get the impression that, in several areas here, that that hackly textured surface is draped over material that resembles the massifs of the Rook Mountains themselves. There's one area just to the north now of our track, where there's a large, roughly equidimensional, mountain mass, with a few projections of massif-like peaks through this hackly textured surface.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|There are also some radial grabens, I just now picked one up, which we've also seen on the Orientale photographs, taken by Lunar Orbiter. It's amazing how fresh appearing this basin looks, considering it's great age. But it's, it probably is not had any more violent a history than Imbrium. Now, we're getting up, just about to go over a delta rim crater that's out in the basin. I don't remember the name of it off hand. But it should be familiar to some of the geologists who have ampped this basin. It does not appear to have a strong impact ejecta blanket around it. It's filled with mare and it's quitely sharply in contrast to a crater of comparable size to the northwest. See that one Ron. I don't know whether you can get it. I get a good view out of 5 now on that one. And, once again, it looks as if it's hackly textured material that forms the higher hills in the inner bench. It has a draped appearance over the, over pre-existing terrain, and in fact, along the ridges of the hummock, we now can pick up a little rilles that roughly parallel the hummock, although not, not consistently. They do cross down into the valley. But has appearance that there may have been a tensional relief along the crest of each of the hummocks, or many of the hummocks.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Delta rim crater just as has been, I think discussed in the literature, has just that. Delta rim with no
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 90:25 CST 15:18 MC337/2
090:25:00|SC|obvious ejecta blanket around it, compared to other larger craters within the basin. We're directly over that crater right now. It's filled with mare, very smooth mare. As a matter of fact, within that fill, I can see no, no craters. Getting very close to the Earth terminator, but you see good texture in the ejecta blanket of the large crater in the north part of the inner basin of Orientale. The radial ridge and valley patterns are very clear, the concentric coarse hummocks near the rim are apparent, and you can even see the second, patterns of secondary, larger secondaries, extending out away, radially out away, from that crater. The south, the mare fill in the south floor of Copernicus, I mean of Orientale, is very smooth, but does have the sea swell texture that we saw over in Tranquillatatis.
|SC|Better let him say something before AOS.
|CAPCOM|I ain't got nothing to say.
|SC|1 guess we're getting close to AOS. We're get ting close to AOS. Do you have some words for us.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we show about 9 minutes to LOS, We'd like to clarify one thing, and that was on this tape recorder commands and high and low bit rate. And we just want to make it clear that pre-burn the 6 minute call out is high bit rate, record forward command reset. Did you tell us a few minutes ago that you did indeed do all those at about 6 minutes? Yes, Gordy, I surely thought I did, but I can't specifically, I know the high bit rate was there, because we switched to low later. I can't, I'm afraid I can't specifically verify the command reset.
|SC|Gordy, I can specifically say that when those, after the BUSS stars came on, we called that out. I'm almost sure Jack did get it, because I had a bunch at the helium valves and the nitrogen, helium and the nitrogen valves.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We're just trying to make sure if we, to determine if we'do have a switch problem, that the INCO did sound low bit rate command just prior to LOS there, before LOI, which is the way it's called out in the flight plan. And then you should have come along later and with a command reset, setting the switch to high bit rate, and the command reset switched into high bit rate MOV, and for some reason it did not go into high bit rate .
|SC|Well, you want to test it out here, before we go around?
|CAPCOM|That's a pretty good thought. I think we will. On standby, we'll give you, we'll figure out how we're going to do it here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We just now commanded low bit rate and you're in low bit rate. We'd like you now to select high and command reset.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, you also have an oscillation in
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 90:25 CST 15:18 MC337/3
090:25:00|SC|uplink signal strength and a clicking in the audio. Do you read? We just switched steady at about 60, 70 per cent signal strength.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We hear that.
|SC|Okay, I'm going to, you want me to go ahead and command high and command reset?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. The high gain just went wide beam, but we're still reading you loud and clear. Go ahead in high bit rate and command reset.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 15:28 GET 90:35 338/1
090:35:00|SC|High bit rate and command reset.
|SC|Okay, high bit rate and command reset.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it seems to have worked properly, Jack .
|SC|Okay, Gordie. I may not have got the command reset at 6 minutes. I just can't tell you right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I want to assure it was no big problem as far as the frame goes no great loss there.
|SC|Hope not.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston about 5 minutes to LOS now we'd like to have you go ahead and get the jet inhibits and the covers open as shown in the flight plan so we can see that before we loose you.
|SC|Okay, Gordie IR cover is coming open. Mark it .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, UV cover is coming open. Mark it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And you want me to stay in high bit rate?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative you're there you're going to have to do it in a minute anyway so since you're there already stay there.
|SC|Okay, we're there we got tape motion.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordie, the AC BDO has been changed and you should have the proper check configuration now.

|CAPCOM|Roger, America.
|SC|Those frames that Ron mentioned, this is Jack, that he mentioned, were taken of an area where there's a much lighter gray albedo, rather than the tannish gray, it's pure gray material that generally is on the rim crest of a number of craters. It may be related to the swirls that we see elsewhere.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Bob, we're abeam of Al-Biruni, coming up on Goddard and Marginis right now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America. We're tracking you on the map here, watching it.
|SC|Al-Biruni has got a variations in its floor. Variations in albedo. It almost looks like a pattern as if water were flowing on a beach. It's that irregular. Not in great areas, but in small areas, around on the southern side, and the part that looks like it's a water washing pattern is of a much lighter albedo, although I cannot see any real source for it. The texture, however, looks about the same.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|And to Houston, America. I forgot the (garble). It took a minute and 45 seconds for the mapping camera to extend and a minute and 45 for it to retract.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 91:24 CST 16:18 MC339/2
091:24:00|SC|just north of Neper now. I tell you, in the mare, there just is no visible relief. Although there seem to be some similar systematic anyway to the distribution. Like, there'd be a very dark area associate with the light area. And that dark area is darker than the mare. I think the pictures will show that. Now, in the highlands, however, the light albedo areas, which are very comparable, that appear to be swirl like patterns of the same type, seem to be associated with a crest of crater ridges and other high points. We're right over a concentration of these now in the northern part of Marginis, where the rule of the light areas being associated with the either symmetrically around a much darker area than the normal naie  or on one side, and in this case, generally the south side of the dark area, that rule is very clear. And that also seems to hold in the backside, that there was a slightly darker region between areas of light colored swirls.

|CAPCOM|Stand by 1, here. I've got an addition for Ron on that comment about that F crater land mark let me  get it straight here and I'll come right up to Ron on it.
|SC|Okay, I'll stand by.
|CAPCOM|Ron, this additional comment will have - the crater is 8 nautical miles north of your track. You will loose the land mark at a 36 degree elevation angle, over.
|SC|Okay, it's 8 miles north and I'll loose it at 30 degrees. Okay so that will be pretty quick.
|CAPCOM|36 degrees it's pretty quick still.
|SC|Is that the one on Family Mountain?
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that Ron let me look at the book, here, and I'll get frug to help me out on that one.
|SC|Okay, Houston I've got F crater, now. I'm all squared away thank you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. It's right in the middle of that landing site four four which is right before Ignin in the book on the land mark tracking book. And it's right dead center on that page.
|SC|Okay, I've got it now I wrote down 404 it's 4 of 4.
|SC|Okay, Houston we've got agoodshot of the landing site.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand and roger Ron.
|SC|The shadows, Bob, go all the way across the Scarp and very long pyramiding shadows go all the way past Family Mountain. Looks like the Sculptured Hills are lit up on this side, but I'd almost put the entire North Massif in shadow from where I stand.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Quite an interesting place to land down the re.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|We can now, I think, see contrast down In the shadow. And the only part of the Scarp that is visible, I think Jack picked it out, as being right where Lara is.
|CAPCOM|Roger. America, Houston.
|SC|Roger, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Just some words in your - you'll be going through your systems checklist here and you'll

|SC|Okay, and I understand that was about 94 hours as I recall.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. That's where the nominal time is and that is where we'd like it dumped.
|SC|Okay. Bob that's a fantastic black and white shot of the landing area with the shadow stretching across most of it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|SC|Bob, I can now see down in through the shadow. I can see Bare Mountain. I can see - I can't really make out the slide yet. Most of the North Massif are still in shadow due to the - due to the Sculptured Hills. And just at the point where we can start really to see through the shadows and see some hummocky terrain on the North Massif. It jus t went out my next reach. But, I did see some sort of albedo change that went across the canyon about in the vicinity of the scarp.

091:52:00|SC|Bob, with respect to the landing site, this is Jack, we had near, closer to low phase angle approaching it, when I first had it in view, there was a clear lightening in the area of the light mantle. It was not sharply defined but around the crater Lara and Nansen and to the west of the Scarp there was very clearly slightly brighter reflectivity.

|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Yeah, it looks like the old gravity grid at work there or something, I didn't see it get out of attitude at all. Did you all see any movement at all?
|CAPCOM|Max air was about two tenths, three tenths a degree, Ron.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|I'm sorry, Houston. I should have cued you on changing the SPS pressure indicators.
|SC|You want to see that again?
|CAPCOM|Standby on that.
|CAPCOM|Jack, it's not required to go back and do 'em again, we watched it on telemetry.
|SC|Okay, I'll try to remember to be a little more imformative.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 92:01 CST 16:54 MC343/1
092:01:00|SC|Okay, Houston, there are the torquing angles.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We see them. They look good.
|SC|Just for another little matter of interest, once the Earth is in the field of view, which it's about, looks like it must be about 12 degrees from Regulus, it's so bright, that it blacks out any, blanks out the telescope for any star recognition. However, it worked real good in the sextant. You can see the star real well. You just have to assume it's Regulus, tho ugh.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Would that star angle difference...
|SC|Okay, I'll torque at 30. I torqued at 30, 0930.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy.
|SC|And the first, the first star angle difference was, you know, you can get a little bit lax about it. If you want to spend a little time at it, you can get five balls, looks like.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. With that star angle difference on the second one, I can assume it was Regulus. I think you're safe in your assumption.
|SC|Oh, yes. Right. He had to do it, or else I'd have to go down there and do it.

|CAPCOM|Jack, just some words from the back room on you. The a -- there may have been an impact at the time you called, but the Moon is still ringing from the SIVB impact, so it's masked any other — would mask any other impact, so they may be able to strip it out at a later time, but right now they don't see anything at your called time.

|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 92 hours 49 minutes. And, we've had loss of signal as Apollo 17 goes behind the Moon. During this pass Jack Schmitt saw a flash just north of the crater Grimaldi at an elapsed time of 90 hours 18 minutes and thought it might be a meteor impact. We could not confirm that; however, the Moon was still ringing from the S-IVB impact and would mask out other activity on seismometer recorders in the science support room here. Apollo 17 will perform the descent orbit insertion maneuver behind the Moon just after the start of the third revolution and at a point near perilune the low point in that revolution. Ignition time for that maneuver is 93 hours 11 minutes 361seconds. Delta-V change of velocity of 197.4 feet per second. Duration of the burn 22 seconds and we anticipate a result of robit of 58.9 by 14.5 nautical miles. If the burn is performed as expected we'll next acquire Apollo 17 at 93 hours 34 minutes 24 seconds. If Apollo 17 is unable to perform the burn acquisition time will be 93 hours 31 minutes 371seconds. We'll come back up just prior to the no burn acquisition time and stand by through that period of several minutes.

093:38:00|SC|Houston, this is the LMP. There seems to be two general kinds of ray patterns. Those associated with a lot of secondaries and light colored and those that have no visible secondary. And that's independent, yet, from the irregular light colored areas we've been calling swirls.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. We're copying.
|SC|Houston, there's also a lot more, there is a lot more of that light colored swirl like irregular material, or discoloration, or whatever you want to call it, in the backside highlands, particularly as we approach Marginis than I had previously gathered from the available photography.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|And there still seems to be no relief asso ciated with it. Although, in many cases, it seems to follow ridge lines, or crater rims partway, in other cases, it's quite irregular in its distribution.

|SC|Rog. There are some very steep slopes that just got grazing Sun on them, and with the binocs, you can see that horizontal lineation pattern.

Hey you guys are going to have some good hills to run down in there. Can you see it all coming up.
|SC|That crazy radar is going to be in the way ... the LM (laughter). Okay it's going through the landing site now. The shadow is just up to - you can really see the scarp on there.
|SC|See what they mean by Sculptured Hills, Gene? See the knobbie characteristics in that area?
|SC|That's a Massif there too. Now, we're just over the rim of Serenitatis looking over the Grobim Plains.
|SC|Yes, I can just see I'm going to switch to 171. 3, 4, 5, 6 - just got 6 of them on 171 and then the other three were were on F crater. 171 was just barely in the Sherlock was just barely beyond the shadow.
|SC|This is all supposedly covered with the dark mantle, Gene what your seeing down there.
|SC|The sun angles are so that you can't tell the difference.

|SC|I think the terminator is giving you the feeling of that maybe.
|SC|Ain't nothing out there.
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston. Can you see any albedo difference in the landing site area between the dark massif and the light area.
|SC|We can't see any difference between - in the low areas between the dark mantle and other materials right now. We're right at the terminator. Yes, but, Jack and I weren't really looking at the landing site. I think Ron was .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 18:48 CST 93:55 GET 351/1
093:55:00|SC|Gerry, you could really see a difference between the South Massif and the mantle material around through there. The mantle is not nearly as dark as it looks on the pictures though. But the Massif, South Massif, especially looked almost a whitish color. I guess it's because the, partly the sun's shining on it. But then - -
|CAPCOM|Could you see anything that looks like the sli de ?
|SC|Oh, yeah, you can see the slide on the thing, definitely see the scarp going across through there. I was primarily concentrating on looking for the various craters so, I didn't spend that much time, you know concentrating on the, how the thing looked. But, in the marks on the thing, the first 4 or 5 marks were on F crater and then I saw Sherlock about half way through it and I got about 5 marks on the Sherlock for 17-1.
|CAPCOM|Rog, Gene.
|SC|Houston, in crossing Crissium and Marginis it looked fairly clear that with the small fresh craters, and I don't have a good size estimate right now, I think I'm looking in terms of 100 or 2 meters, you can distinguish where blocks have been thrown up by them and are not possibly giving depth of the local regolith, from the pictures you'll get in there.
|CAPCOM|Rog» Jack.
|SC|And also on that lineation question, not only, where the sun grazes a slope do you see the horizontal lineations but they're at the southern end of the shadowed area on a slope, you get a couple other lineations showing up at least in a couple places I saw. one would be parellel to the slope, that is cross contour and the other was at an angle to that direction, oh, say about 30 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. We're copying you loud and clear and no problems with com at all.
|SC|Okay, we just had sunset. And Houston, America, on Mag Bravo, Bravo, 75 to 70 percent were utilized on J3, and F crater and 17 1 through the sextant,
|CAPCOM|Roger. Just want to confirm, Ron, you started on J3 and then you went to F crater and then
|SC|Yeah, I went to F crater and then back to Sherlock, or 17 1.

|SC|Okay, a number of the last pictures that were taken on that series, or that rev were taken between say about 1 15 east and, oh, about 100 east and they show several examples of the light colored or swirl alterations to the surface.

He would recommend using the binoculars. Don't take any of your eat or sleep time at all, but you might get a chance on this one eat pass to as you go by there.
|SC|Okay. I'll give her a try. You might give me a couple minutes warning the next time around.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SC|I'm not sure the attitude is too good for that. I wish I'd thought of it this round.
|CAPCOM|Uh , Rog. Well, we were pretty busy coming up on it this time. I think the at — that's why we mentioned that the attitude may be okay during the eat period. we'don't want you to break away from the eat period unless you see you can spare some time.
|SC|Just looking at the southern edge of Grimaldi, Bob, and we probably have it covered on photos, but there's a nice tangential to slightly circumferential graben along the southern wall and climbs out over the western rim and off the eastern rim, and that graben is pre-mare, pre-mare.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy on that, Jack, and as long as we're talking about Grimaldi, you might just rem - we'd like to have you brief Ron exactly the location of that flash you saw. We 11 probably ask him to take a picture of it, maybe during one of his solo periods.
|SC|Hey, Bob, before we get awfully involved, just let me tell you what our motive is here in the next couple of hours. That's to eat and get done what's in the flight plan, and come our rest period, we're probably going to turn out the lights so make sure everything's done by then so we can start it on time tonight.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's a definite — we concur with that definitely, Gene. Don't want you to work into your sleep period.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Gene, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Gene, last night you didn't use a tone booster, and the word you gave us was that it had -- it wasn't working,1' and we're just wondering if you want -- we're thinking about working up a test board to see if -- did you test it out thoroughly to make sure it wasn't working, or was that just your desire not to use it?
|SC|We tried it, Bob, and it did not work. The only reason I'm reluctant on a test Is that I just don't want it to take much time.
|CAPCOM|I don't think it would take much time. The only thing I could say is it would -- you know, two obvious things I'm sure you checked them, Gene, would be the utility power and make sure you had the right lamp tests on when you tried it, and that's the only -- I'm sure you did It, and that's the only obvious thing — maybe a circuit breaker or something like that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 19:15 GET 94:22 MC354/2
094:22:00|SC|Well, we checked it both on the left side and on the right side with two separate utility powers and verified that the master alarm came on with the test on both sides, and nothing ever happened.
|CAPCOM|Rog, I was sure of that, Gene. Just wanted to make it clear and put everybody at ease that it's just not working. That was essentially the test. Just forget anything we said about tests.
|SC|Okay. What test?
|CAPCOM|Rog. Got you guys trained up there, finally.
|SC|Arf, arf.
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Rog, go ahead, Ron.
|SC|If I ever find my scissors here one of these days, I think it takes about 4 bolts on either side of the — you know the optics, where they stow the optics? It looks like there are four little 2-lead bolts that'll come out. And, I think maybe they might be back behind there, I don't know. See, there's a great big slot up at the top of that, oh, it's at least an inch, inch between the top of the optics thing and the top of the spacecraft. I looked back in there with a flashlight and can't see anything, but it's a big hole back there anyhow.
|SC|I think the Commander might have something to s ay.
|SC|Hey, Bob, just ignore everything he said. We'll leave him a pair of our scissors, and he's just worried about being hungry.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Those are your EVA scissors, too, aren't they?
|SC|But, he is not -- yeah, but we can handle - we can handle it with one down there. He is not taking the spacecraft apart to find his scissors, and I will not let him go h ungry.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 19:25 CST 94:31 GET 355/1
094:31:00|SC|Okay, get awake.
|SC|Hey, Bob, before we loose you, how did the Oilers do today? (laughs)
|CAPCOM|9 to 3. Steelers over the Oilers.
|SC|9 to 3?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed.
|SC|9? 09 to 03?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CAPCOM|Played one of their better games I guess.
|SC|How about the Chicago Bears? Have you got that score handy?
|CAPCOM|Hey, Jack, how about if we pick you up during the eat period, while you're eating, we'll brief you of the whole NFL situation for today? Okay?
|SC|Well, we are eating. I guess we wait till we come around next time.
|CAPCOM|Oh, I, the Bears were, the Bears were lo os in g.
|SC|Bob, we'll wait and you can get up the late evening news prepared for us here the next time we come aro und.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Have your gourmet dinner and I'll give you the news.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We're going to loose you here in about 2 and one-half minutes. We'll see you at 95:28 according to flight plan and you're looking good we'don't have anything, any anomalies or anything against you right now. You're looking great.
|SC|Thank you, Robert, we'll see you coming around the horn.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, Bob, if you could, it might be appreciated with a word or two from our home front.
|CAPCOM|Yeah.
|SC|Didn't let me do it. I was going to give 'em all a call while on this LOS here. It's that thing again. I bet you were concentrating on the dot.
|CAPCOM|Hey, guys, the Bears 21 to 12 over Phila- delph i a.
|SC|Thank you. We're going to watch your signal get cut off here.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Was touch and go on that cause at one time they're loosing that game.
|SC|They won, Pete.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 94 hours 41 minutes. We've had lost signal on the 3rd revolution. Ron Evans performed some land mark tracking on the front side of the Moon during this pass and we got some earth weather reports from lunar orbit, believed to be a first, in the Apollo series. And spacecraft is in the attitude now to perform the ultra-violet spectrometer and the infrared scanning radiometer experiments. We would expect to acquire Apollo 17 next at 95 hours 28 minutes. Will come back up then, at 94 hours 42 minutes this is Mission Control, Hous t on .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 95:27 CST 20:21 MC356/1
095:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 95 hours 27 minutes. We should be acquiring Apollo 17 on it's fourth revolution of the Moon in about 45 seconds. We'll stand by for the first words. We have a signal and are receiving data.
|SC|Hello Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Hello America. Reading you loud and clear.
|SC|Bob, the flight plan is complete to 95:30.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And Bob, the IR cover came open about 1 minute late.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Understand. Might be interested. The lasted tracking data has you at about 14.1 perilune. It's coming up closer to your CMC data. And, America, we'd like to have the H2 tank, H2 tank 1, fans off. We'll be letting that pressure decay on that. We'll be bringing them back on prior to sleep period.
|SC|Okay, that's off.
|CAPCOM|I've got a number of pads and flight plan update any time you're ready for them, if you want or you can hold off it awhile.
|SC|Why don't you start with flight plan update. Bob?
|CAPCOM|Okay, At 97:30, you should have a pen and ink change there that says UV cover closed. After that add UV off.
|SC|Okay, got it ,
|CAPCOM|Okay, now, just a note, or you can jump way aheadto 106:51, where it says delete, see where it says UV off, just delete that, or else make a verified, because it will be off during that whole period.
|SC|106. Yes, I'll just put a verified by that. 106:51.
|CAPCOM|Roger. The next thing I've got are the pads. The TEI 12 and TEI 19 pad.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|The first one is TEI 12, SPS G&N 38570 plus 049 plus 092, NOUN 33 times 111544286 plus 25438 minus 17656 minus 7950. Roll is 186109 328. The rest of the pad is not applicable. Great, great, Jack, we'd like an ACCEPT on the computer please.
|SC|You got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. The descent stars are as always, Sirius and Rigel, 133200030. 4 Jet 12 second on the ullage. Three notes: Burn undocked, assumes no CIRC, longitude of the Moon at TIG will ' be minus 140.19 degrees. Over.
|SC|Bob, give me note two again please.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, the three comments are: assumes burn undocked, assumes no CIRC burn and the Moon at TIG, the longitude will be minus 140.19 degrees. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 95:27 CST 20:21 MC356/2
095:27:00|SC|Okay, I got everything, but number 2. Allright, here's your readback. TEI 12, twelve that is, SPS/G&N 38570 plus 049 plus 092 111544286 plus 25438 minus 17656 minus 07950. 186 109328. Rest of the pad is NA. Sirius and Rigel 133200030. Ullage is 4 Jets for 12 seconds. Remarks: (1) burn undocked, (2) assume no CIRC, (3) longitude, lunar longitude at TIG minus 14019 degrees, .19 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Good readback, Jack, and I've got the TEI 19 pad, if you're ready. 1
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 20:30 CST 95:36 GET 357/1
095:36:00|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|SC|TEI 19, SPS G&N 380 23 plus 049 plus 086 the tape time 125 46 4722 plus 24563 minus 19253 minus 07313 186 108 325 rest of the pad is not applicable. All the notes are the same as on the TEI—12 pad except the longitude is minus 147.62. Over.
|SC|Standby one.
|SC|Okay, here's your readback. TEI 19, SPS G&N 380 23 plus 049 plus 086 125 46 4722 plus 24563 minus 1925 3 minus 07313 186 108 325 rest of the pad is in A and the remarks are the same as for TEI-12 and that includes set stars and the only change in the 3 which is the lunar longitude at TIG of a minus 147.62. Over.
|CAPCOM|That's a good readback, Jack. I've got a LM dap readup for you. They recommend this be copied on page 1 of the LM da.ta card books, Jack,
|SC|Well, strangely enough the LM data card book's in the LM. We'll put it in our activation book. Let me find the right page.
|CAPCOM|0kay .
|SC|Let me find the right page.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, the computer's yours.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, LM dap information. LM weight 36714, CSM weight 38078.
|SC|Okay, the dap load is LM weight 36714, CSM weight 38078.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, and I'd like to correct one call on my, the TEI pad. There is one other difference between the TEI 19 and the TEI-12 under notes. And the TEI-19 assumes the circ burn, over.
|SC|Okay, that's corrected to assume circ on the TEI-19. CAPCOM Roger, Jack. I'm sorry on that. I've got some notes from the flight ---
|SC|That's alright, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Got some notes for Gene from the Flight Surgeon. He promised an update to you on some meal recommendations here on food. You might want to copy this into a supplement.
|SC|Okay. Just standby one, please.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, let us take a look at the landing area and will be right back with you.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Just whenever you want it, there's no hurry on this at all. Jack, you just might put a little note there somewhere for yourself that Copernicus is at 96.03 if you want to look at it.
|SC|Okay. 96.03.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 20:38 GET 95:45 358/1
095:45:00|PAO|Apollo 17 is coming up over the Taurus Littrow landing site now.
|SC|Now we're getting some clear - looks like pretty clear high water marks on the -
|SC|There is high water marks all over the p 1 ace th e re.
|SC|- on the north part of Tranq uil litatis in here mare onto the highlands.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Yes, there is high water marks all over that mare - I think that's Miraldi there. Are you sure we're at 15 miles up?
|CAPCOM|Your at 14.1 to be exact, Ron.
|SC|(laughter) looks pretty low.
|SC|Gee I wonder what it feels like to be at 8 to 10.
|CAPCOM|You're going to find out I think.
|SC|I tell you there's some mare ridge or scarps very senuous just passing one, but not only cross the low plainer areas but go right up the side of a crater in one place and a hill in another. And it's not at all like a false scarp. It's looks very much like a constructional ridge. And it has the senuousity of - pardon the expression rattle snake.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Does it look like that one we saw on the track the other day.
|SC|Yes, very much like that one that you almost caught. There are tons of pressure - several of them grabens in here. We must be out on the edge of Serenitatis now, right?
|CAPCOM|Yes, we show you on the edge of Sereni tatis , Jack.
|SC|Rog, I just - we'didn't get a view of the site, though, going over this time. I think it was off to the north of us just a tad. That's the best example of a mare like ridge that was as clearly constructional as I would want to see it. Out on the mare it's never quite that obvious. But there it climbed up over a hill and then back down again.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And, that was just east of the — an area just east of the edge of Serenitatis and probably a little bit south of the landing site.
|SC|Say, Bob rather than copy specific re commended changes or deletions to a diet can you have a general comment that's any different than what I already understand.
|CAPCOM|Right it's no problem.
|SC|If not I would rather delay it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 20:38 GET 95:45 358/2
095:45:00|CAPCOM|It's no problem, Gene. Two quick com ments, the next couple of days delete the peach ambrosia and the mixed fruit bar. And don't delete anything from the LM menu. And make sure you get all the water in for rehydration and take, bias it if you think you get 30 percent gas then put in 30 percent more so you get all the water that required. And take two antigas tablets after each meal instead of one. That sums it up.
|SC|Okay, very good I'll handle all those words according to their needs.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Appreciate them, though.
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|We shooting magazine QQ frame 50, frame 50, 51 and 52. We're taking - looking south at the terminator.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we need to get looking at the pan camera per the flight plan.
|SC|Thank you.
|SC|Okay, Bob, power on the pan camera n ow. Mark i t.
|CAPCOM|Roger, got it.
|SC|Okay, and is my biomed been looking alright ?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 20:48 GET 95:54 MC359/1
095:54:00|CAPCOM|America, you can turn the pan camera off.
|SC|Okay, pan camera going off. Mark.
|SC|Got the uplink.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Let's see. Will Copernicus — will be north of our track. Is that correct?
|CAPCOM|I believe so from my charts here, but let me double check that. That is affirmative. Tommy just gave me the up on that one.
|CAPCOM|If you guys got time to listen, I can update you on the homefront while you're looking out the windows.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 20:55 GET 96:02 MC360/1
096:02:00|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Let's see. For the CDR, they're eating beans and cornbread over at Nassau Bay tonight. Probably a good thing they're eating beans there, Gene, because you're feeding twenty-five tonight. And, the horse is getting fed, also.
|SC|Beans and cornbread? It's a good thing I'm eating up here.
|CAPCOM|You better believe it. And, of course, every body sends their love. And, over in El Lago, they're, well — Go ahead, Gene.
|SC|I was just going to ask you to return mine for me, would you?
|CAPCOM|Oh, you better believe it. They're listening to the squawk box. You don't have to say anything to me. And, over in El Lago, Jamie is saying her prayers ending them with "God bless America and Challenger" from now on. And, John is saying, There's Daddy's rocket makes it go pitch light out. Of course, everybody sends their love —
|SC|They're great.
|CAPCOM|And, they're all listening right now if you'd -
|SC|Tell John, though, that I shaved the other ni ght.
|CAPCOM|Roger. He'll be listening, hearing that. They're all over at the -- in Nassau Bay at a big meeting of the flight plan. Where the Parkers are briefing the Cernans and the Evans on the flight plan tonight. And, out in Tucson, for the LMP, it's kind of cloudy and cold out there today. It's colder than normal. Everything's working fine on the speaker out there, Jack, and they're just listening, and Mother — your Mother is really tickled and just pleased as all get out.
|SC|That sounds like Mother. And, I just got a real good view of Copernicus, but I'm afraid I can't help you out on that structure in the central peak. Just a little too dark.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|But, it's a fantastic sight at this altitude. There's a big crater. It looks like it's about 80 kilometers in diameter.
|CAPCOM|I'll drink to that.
|SC|And, put down a verify on those dark deposits in the wall. And, also on the southeast wall, there's one right on the rim. I think we mapped that one, too, but I'll have to go back and check.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|That one looked like it had a crater in it. However, they all tend to be elongate radially with respect with the crater. But, that's about all I can add now.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 20:55 GET 96:02 MC360/2
096:02:00|SC|Bob, I'm glad the squawk box is fixed, and, of course, send my love and best wishes out there to Tucson.
|CAPCOM|That's a roger, Jack. You guys might also be interested here in the Houston area. All of the ground voice — or air-to-ground is being carried on FM station — 100 percent of it — and KUHT, the television station, will cover the — educational TV station is going to cover 100 percent of the EVA's, all three of them for all the time.
|SC|That sounds great. We hope we can provide them with as much education as we can entertainment.
|CAPCOM|We're counting on it.
|SC|I guess Parker's all we have left down there to brief them on the landing site, huh?
|CAPCOM|I won't even comment on that one. (Laughter)
|SC|Okay. I figure he will later.
|SC|I'd like, also, to send my best up north to the Bell — the Bellwood area up there, because I think there's a squawk box up there, too.
|CAPCOM|Beautiful.
|SC|And, Bob, it's — all in all, it's been a pretty exciting day. I think a pretty accomplishing day, and certainly a rewarding day on our part. It's also been a long day, but we're hoping that it can only be superceded by tomorrow and judging from what we've got in store, it might very well be.
|CAPCOM|I think that sums up the day. It's a day of anticipation for what's going to happen tomorrow. Everything's gone off real well here, and we're just glad you're in the overture end and ready for tomorrow.
|SC|My goodness, Bob. This is Jack. It's awful hard to spend much time up here anticipating. The events come so fast and, certainly, are exciting and rewarding, each one, one at a time. But, obviously, tomorrow is going to be the biggy.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we're watching your 52 and just be ad vised you do not have to do the Option 1.
|SC|Okay. Real fine, Bob.
|SC|Bob, I'm not sure whether it's entirely proper, being a bachelor, but I'd like to send my regards to everybody — all the families listening to squawk boxes tonight.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, we're going right over the Procellarum Ridge now, if I'm not mistaken. Out in the middle of Mare Procellarum, and we're low enough now that you can see some of the terrain .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|That is — that is, some of the hills, and rilles, and valleys associated with that ridge system.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 20:55 GET 96:02 MC360/3
096:02:00|CAPCOM|Roger. Break, Ron. We've got the 52, and it looks good. You can torque.
|SC|Okay, I'll torque it ten three zero.

096:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Gene Cernan's remark about up north in Bellwood is a reference to his mother, Mrs. Andrew Cernan, who is following the course of the mission at her home in Bellwood, Illinois.
|SC|Houston, America. You want any memories up -
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're standing by. We're ready for i t .
|SC|Okay, V74, 6 -.
|SC|The GDC is aligned and we verified that the LM valve is in LM/CM Delta P.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We got you.
|CAPCOM|The E mod is finished, Ron.
|SC|Okay, thank you.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we're ready to uplink the Jet monitor program and one of the burn constants.
|SC|Okay, you have CMC and ACCEPT.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|P20 and ACCEPT.
|CAPCOM|While you're eating or getting ready to eat, I can update some of the news with you tonight, if you're away from the windows. Are you all still looking out?
|SC|No. Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, there's not a whole lot of news on the wire tonight, as a matter of fact. President Nixon received a firsthand report on private Viet Nam peace negotiations today from a key member of the US negotiating team, General Alexander Haig, Jr., Henry Kissinger's Chief Lieutenant. Haig flew back from Paris to report to the President, while technical experts from both sides held and unusual Sunday meeting in the French capitol. Presidential Assistant Kissinger will resume his talks with North Viet Nam's Le Due To on Monday, after a one day recess. And former President Harry Truman continued to show some signs of improvement late today after he was earlier removed from the critical list at Research Hospital Hospital up in Kansas City. His cardiac situation has improved and this improvement included a slower and stronger pulse and a stable blood pressure. The football scores are as follows in the National Footbal League today: the Bears defeated the Eagles 21 to 12, the Detroit Lions and the Buffalo Bills played to a 21-21 stand off, Dolphins extended their undefeated streak 23 to 13 over the New York Giants, the Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints 17 to 10, Green Bay sewed up the Central Division of the NFC by defeating the Vikings 23 to 7, the Cardinals upset the Rams today 24 to 14, Denver defeated San Diego 38-13, Kansas City upset Baltimore 24 to 10, the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 GET 96:11 CST 21:05 MC361/2
096:11:00|CAPCOM|49'ers defeated the Falcons 20 to nothing, 20 to 0, and Pittsburg defeated Houston 9 to 3, and they took the Central Division of the AFC. So, the playoff picture is becoming a litte clearer. You've got, in the NFC you've got Washington, Dallas, and Green Bay, and the fourth team will either be San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Atlanta. That will be decided next week. In the AFC Pittsburg, Miami, and Oakland are in it, and the fourth team will be either the Jets and another team. They've got the Giants listed here, but it can't be the Giants, because that's the wrong division. So we'll check that one out. Cleveland, okay, Cleveland. The fourth team is either going to be Cleveland or the Jets . And did you get a spurious as master caution warning.
|SC|No, Ron was retesting our bleeper again.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 21:15 GET 96:20 362/1
096:20:00|SC|Ron was retesting our bleeper again.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And, one of those that worked in lunar orbit, I guess. It doesn't work during coast because it's working now.
|CAPCOM|Good show.
|SC|Sounds like there's going to be some good football games coining up.
|CAPCOM|Yes indeed.
|SC|Who is playing tomorrow night?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. That's the Oakland - Oakland an d the jets.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Ron, the uplink is complete. The EMP is running. The computer's yours.
|SC|Okay, Bob we got it back.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we would like the H2 tank fans on and that will be the sleep configure. H2 tank 1 fans on, and leave 3 in auto.
|SC|You want H2 tank 1 - you want 1 and 2 on?
|CAPCOM|Negative tank 1 on.
|SC|Okay, that leave us with tank 1 on tank 2 off and tank 3 in auto. Is that what you want?
|CAPCOM|Roger. You're calling A2 fans that's what we wan t.
|SC|Yes, H2 fans Bob I'll say it again. H2 fans 1 is on, 2 is off and 3 is auto.
|CAPCOM|That's a good configuration, and that will be the sleep configuration.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Hey, Bob it looks like we might make - get to sleep on time tonight, and - well we will make it. And I think it goes without saying we'definitely want to get up on time tomorrow.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|I'm going to have the toe booster plugged in, and also I'll make sure the (Garble) power and audio power and all that stuff is on.
|CAPCOM|Roger.

096:27:00|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|If Ron's listening, just a word about the mapping camera extend retract times, we came up with slightly different times than what he'd called and we were wondering if his were just ball mark or if he had timed it? In either case the times are a little bit long on extend retract which is a little cause for worry about that mapping camera may fail and later on downstream we may want to change our operating mode on that mapping camera and he might want to time a little closer. If he can get the chances it could come up.
|SC|Bob, that's a good point on the thing, those weren' t quoted exact times and matter of fact we kinda looked away and it was about a ... you know, somewhere about that period, of time. We looked away and when we looked back it was gray again. Next time we extend them I'll get a good accurate indication.
|CAPCOM|Okay, no problem. We'll believe the strip ch ar t.
|CAPCOM|We'll take the strip chart data. We've got 1 24, 1 minute 24 seconds for extend and 1 51, 1 minute 51 seconds for retract. And both those are a little bit on the high side.
|SC|Okay. I would believe the strip chart.
|CAPCOM|Rog, Ron, you all are about 4 minutes from LOS. Okay, we might loose you a little bit earlier than that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we may loose you a little early due to the SIM bay attitude and will pick you up at 97:22.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Once more around at 9 7:22.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 96 hours 34 minutes. Apollo 17 has turned the corner a little early, about 50 seconds early. We've lost contact with the antenna because of it's attitude, about 50 seconds early. During this 4th pass on the front side of the Moon there was considerable description of the Lunar surface and photography was accomplished. The mapping camera experts will continue to study the extension and retraction times of the camera. If those times continue to grow, they will probably revise the flight plan somewhat to reduce the number of times that camera must be extended and retracted. At the present time though they are just keeping a close eye on those times to see whether they will continue to grow. We'll next acquire Apollo 17 on it's 5th revolution of the Moon at 97 hours 2 2 minutes. APOLLO L7 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 22:15 GET 97:21 364/1 p1This is Apollo control at 97 hours 21 minutes. We're fifty seconds away from the time Apollo 17 should be within communications range on it's fifth revolution of the Moon. We'll stand by for the first contact.
|PAO|Wehaveasignalnow.
|SC|Ho us ton, 17.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, go ahead.
|SC|Roger, we're just about ready to finish up here. I have a couple of questions. Do you want us to cycle cryo fans or just leave them alone now?
|CAPCOM|We'd like them just left alone, left in your configuration you are now, Jack.
|SC|Okay, there will be no cyclying then.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we have one question. Whose got the duty tonight or will he be wearing a headset.
|SC|Yes, Ron has the duty he will be wearing the headset, but I will be on the biomed underneath.
|CAPCOM|Understand that, and one note for Gene. It's an addtiion to that flight surgeons note. When you rehydrate your food make sure that you go the — let it re hydrate for the maximum amount of time. I know you miss it on this one, but the next - like tomorrow morning make sure it rehydrates the maximum amount of time.
|SC|Okay, I'll tell him.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And we've got the star crater stereo trio.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And we're mag oscar oscar is on 93 now. The last three pictures were that trio.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 97 hours 28 minutes. We're showing -
|SC|We're sensing complete on the presleep checklist. And except for computing agents configuration and Ron will take care of that.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And, Bob while we're gradually getting into configuration here let me reiterate something that I've been watching this rev as we'did a lot of other things. And that was this relationship of the light colored or light gray swirl patterns on the surface to patterns associated pattern parallel patterns that are darker than the average of the surrounding area. And this is true both in Mare Marginus and in most cases on the back side.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, we'll get that to the Pis.
|SC|Roughly, although their very irregular patterns roughly it's concentric zoning of dark to light
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 22:15 GET 97:21 364/2
097:21:00|SC|within an intermediate albedo surface. Now there are variations on that theme sometimes you don't get the symmetry quite as good, but it's common enough that I think it's worth noting.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 22:24 CST 9 7:30 GET 365/1
007:30:00|SC|Also, there's a sequence, different kinds of crater filling on the far side, and I think that as the orbital stay progresses, we may be able to pin down the relative age relationships and the characteristics of those crater fill -filling episodes. Whether they are single episodes that happen in a variety of craters or they're a function of the age and characteristics of the craters in which you find them is not clear right now, but the - they seem to form fairly distinct groupings of crater fill material.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|One of those crater fill materials that you also see in other kinds of depressions other than craters is a very smooth light plains forming material and it is although cratered when you see it at the terminator, it is smoother than the Mare. That is, it does not seem to have the swell, the sea swell characteristics or ridges or any other features other than the craters superimposed on it.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy.
|PAO|Apollo 17's orbit now 59.2 by 13.7 nautical miles. The present altitude's 17.8 nautical miles.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, You can go ahead and close the uv cover. We'd like to hold off one minute before you turn the UV off. We want to look at one minute of data with the cover closed.
|SC|Oh, okay. Roger. A walk on. I see it n ow.
|SC|Okay, it's closed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll give you a cue when you go UV OFF and Hinkle would like to know what you've got on your high gain pitch and yaw knobs. Not the dials but the knobs.
|SC|Alright. The knobs are see, about plus 20 and 185.
|CAPCOM|A pitch of 20 and 185 on the yaw.
|SC|That's affirmed.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, you can turn the UV off now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 22:32 GET 97:38 MC366/1
097:38:00|SC|Okay, it's off.
|SC|Okay, I got the landing site. We're right over the top of it, and the Scarp is fantastically detailed at this1can you see in there, Gene? Right down, right down, straight down there. Okay, well, the light mantle is ob — very obviously mantling the area. The Scarp was very detailed, . and so far, could not see any structure in the Massifs at all, but I haven't had any — didn't have much time to watch it on that pass. The slide very definitely subdued the general detail in the Plains area — or the light mantle, if you will, rather than slide. MOCR Crater was finally out of the dark.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'd like to know if you think you can adjust the high gain as close to plus 15 and yaw 190 as possible?
|SC|Okay, Bob, that's adjusted plus 15 and 190, and I suspect I was a little closer to 15 than 20 when I called you before.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I'll tell you, from this altitude and with that low sun, there's no question of the sharpness of the topographic features in the landing area. The Scarp, and even some of the apparent back part -- backflow features, and Parker will know what I'm talking about — that is apparent flows to the west in the light mantle area were extremely sharp, even those fronts going west were sharp. It looked even more like a mare ridge than it ever did before.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Bob, this is Gene. I had a — just a quick view of the site, and if we're anywhere near it, we'll recognize it, I think, without question. And, I think with that, we'll bid farewell, and goodnight.
|CAPCOM|Okay, gang. And looking for a busy day tomorrow —
|SC|That's for sure. You'll see him --
|CAPCOM|Sorry, I cut you out.
|SC|I said never fear, your CMP is watching.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And, just a reminder - SMO off tonight — please?
|SC|He has the watch tonight.
|SC|Okay, okay, as soon as I get bedded down, I'll do that.
|SC|Don't worry, he's got a batch of guys up here reminding him of that one.
|SC|And, I checked out the little whistle, and it works like a charm.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I was betting on you guys making that switch last night, and I lost my bet.
|SC|Just to make sure, I'll check it again.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 22:32 GET 97:38 MC366/2

|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 97 hours 53 minutes. Crew has just turned off the voice switch on the spacecraft, indicating they do not intend to talk anymore tonight, and we'do not intend to put in anymore calls to them, so we'll take this line down now and come back up with hourly reports, during the sleep period, which has just started.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/10/72 CST 23:45 GET 98:52 MC 368/1
098:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 98 hours 52 minutes. Flight Director, Pete Frank and members of the Orange Team, are preparing to hand over flight control duties to Flight Director, Gene Kranz and the White Team at this time. There will be no change of shift news conference. Shortly after the Orange Team came on duty, the descent orbit insertion number 1 maneuver was performed. At 93 hours 11 minutes 36 seconds, this was a very good burn. Duration 22 seconds. Velocity change of 198.2 feet per s e con d. Re suit an t orbit was 59.1 by 14.9 nautical mi 1 e s . Apollo 17 crew since that time has been performing landmark tracking through the sextant, a great deal of photography, and performing the ultraviolet spectrometer and infrared scanning radiometer experiments, and providing surface descriptions, the geology reports and some Earth weather reports from lunar orbit. The infrared experiment will be continued throughout the rest period that the crew is now in. The ultraviolet experiment has been terminated for tonight. The mapping camera is taking longer to extend and retract than expected. And the last operation took 1 minute 24 seconds to extend and 1 minute 51 seconds to retract. Each of these operations should be accomplished in 1 minute 12 seconds. The camera experts will continue to watch this and if the delayed operation continues, they may reduce the number of times that the camera is extended and retracted. Crew said goodnight at 97 hours 47 minutes. They're anticipating a big day tomorrow, landing, first EVA. 7 hours 49 minutes remaining in that rest period. Apollo 17's present orbit is 59.1 by 13.5 nautical miles. And a short time ago the flight dynamics officer gave the flight director the latest impact coordinates for the S-IVB which impacted the lunar surface today at 89 hours 39 minutes 40 seconds. Coordinates for that impact; 4.21 degrees south latitude, 12.31 degrees west longitude. At 98 hours 55 minutes this is mission control Houston.

099:16:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 99 hours 16 minutes. We are about 1 minute from reacquiring Apollo 17 now in its 6th revolution of the Moon. We said goodnight to the crew on the last revolution at 97 hours 47 minutes and the flight surgeon reported that it appeared Jack and Ron were both dozing off before we lost radio contact with the spacecraft as it went around behind the Moon on the fifth revolution. Here in Mission Control, flight director Gene Kranz has been reviewing the status of the mission with his oncoming team of flight controllers. No problems of note to be reported. The service propulsion system engine, it was reported, looks to be in very good shape as a result of the, or based on the data received during the LOI and DOI, the lunar orbit insertion and descent orbit insertion maneuvers performed earlier. The flight dynamics officer, during this shift, is going to be following the spacecraft trajectorys very closely looking for any cross range or down range errors which would need to be compensated for prior to the lunar landing. we'don't expect any conversations with the crew. We have had confirmation of acquisition of signal now and we'll stand by for a short period of time to get a look at the systems and to assure that we're not going to get a call from the crew. This is Apollo Control. No sign of any activity from the crew. The flight surgeon reports that Jack Schmitt and Ron Evans, both of whom are wearing their biomedical sensors during the sleep period, appear to be sleeping soundly at this time. Apollo 17 is currently in an orbit 59.1 by 13.5 nautical miles and we have about 52 minutes remaining before the spacecraft again goes behind the Moon and we lose radio contact. We'll come up with a status report shortly prior to loss of signal. At 99 hours 31 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.

We have about 6 hours 22 minutes remaining in this sleep period before the crew awakens to a very busy day which will include landing on the Moon for the Lunar Module Crew, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan and the first Lunar Surface EVA. Shortly before loosing radio contact Gene Crans checked with each of his flight controllers, got a report that everything was in order, no problems as Apollo 17 went behind the Moon. We'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in its seventh revolution in a little less than 45 minutes. At 100 hours 23 minutes this is Apollo Control, H ous t on.

101:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 101 hours 10 minutes and we are standing by now to re-establish radio contact with Apollo 17 at the beginning of it s seventh revolution of the Moon. We anticipate the crew will be1. sleeping soundly as they were when we last had radio contact with the spacecraft some 45 minutes ago. Infact, the 2 crewmen on whom we have biomedical data, Ron Evans and Jack Schmitt, appeared to have gone to sleep almost as soon as they said goodnight. Very shortly thereafter the surgeon noted the slow down in heart rhythms thypical of sleep. And that is the condition they were in when we last saw them at the end of the sixth revolution. And we have reacquired radio contact with Apollo 17 and getting good data from the spacecraft at this time. The crew is scheduled to end this 8 hour rest period in a little over 4 and one half hours from now. And it appears that everything is quiet aboard Apollo 17 and no signs of any crew activity. We will take the lines down and continue to monitor and we'll come up with another status report just prior to loss of signal as the spacecraft goes behind the Moon on this the seventh revolution. This is Apollo Control at 101 hours 12 minutes.

The crew now, a little more than 5 hours into their sleep period, about 2 hours 40 minutes remaining before we send them the wakeup call. And all spacecraft systems continue to perforin normally. No outstanding problems at this time. We are showing Apollo 17 in an orbit of about 59 by 13 nautical miles, and we should be seeing telemetry data shortly now. Radio from the spacecraft being received at the 210 foot dish antenna at Honeysuckle Creek, Australia, near Canberra. And we're once again receiving data from the spacecraft. We, of course, do not expect any activity from the crew and we'll have the lines down during this front side pass, should there be any unexpected conversations we'11 bring up the lines immediately. We'll have about 1 hour and 5 minutes before Apollo 17 disappears around the back side of the Moon on the eighth revolution. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

During the nineth revolution we'll be sending the wakeup call to the crew, getting them ready for one of their busiest days on the mission which will include LM seperation from the Command Module and the powered desent to the lunar surface followed by the first period of lunar surface exploration in the valley of the Taurus Mountains. The flight surgeon reports the crew has been getting, apparently, a very good nights sleep. They are now six and one half hours into that scheduled 8 hours sleep period with about an hour and one half of sleep remaining.

During this front side pass CAPCOM, Joe Allen, will be putting in a call to the crew getting them up and started on a very active day which will include landing on the lunar surface in a valley of the Taurus Mountains near the Sea of Serenity. Our last look at the spacecraft's lunar orbit showed it to be maintaining an orbit fairly close to 13 nautical miles by 59 nautical miles, actually dropping down somewhat below 13 on the pericynthion to about 12 point 6. And we should have radio contact with the spacecraft shortly and we'll begin getting telemetry data on all of the spacecraft systems. We have 46 minutes showing until scheduled crew wakeup time. And we've had the AOS call, acquisition of a signal, getting good high bit rate data at this time. And the flight dynamics officer's orbit display shows Apollo 17 to be in an orbit of a high point of 59 point 9 nautical miles. The low point or pericynthion of 12 point 5.

|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've now had loss of signal as Apollo 17 goes behind the Moon on the ninth revolution. We'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes - a little bit less, as the spacecraft comes back on the front side on the tenth revolution. And by that time the crew should have completed breakfast. They'll be getting the pressure suit unstowed and begin preparations for entering the lunar module, for the separation landing on the lunar surface, and the first EVA all scheduled to occur this day. The IR data which Joe Allen advised the crew we're getting in such good form back here on the ground from the spacecraft's service module, is from the IR scanning radiometer. This is an instrument carried in the CSM SIM bay, scientific instrument module bay. And it's obtaining surface temperatures under the groundtrack of the spacecraft from which scientist will be able to construct a temperature map. From this information they hope to be able to characterize such lunar surface physical parameters as the general conductivity, the bulk density and the specific heat. Apollo 17 at the present time is in an orbit about 59 nautical miles at it's high point and about 12 and a half miles above the lunar surface at the low point.

|CAPCOM|Okay, and we're supposed to update your trajectory, which is looking good. Predicted perilune at TDI without DOI 2 would be 11.9, a little lower, so that means that DOI 2 will be a little less,in terms of DELTA V than nominal. But otherwise, looking good.
|SC|Okay, did you say 11.2 for perigee, now - without the DOI 2.
|CAPCOM|I might have said that, it's 11.9 pre dicted at PDI time without the D0I2.
|SC|Okay, 11.9 predicted without - at PDI time without DOI 2.
|CAPCOM|That's right.
|SC|Okay, so DOI 2 will be a little bit less than predicted.
|CAPCOM|Affirmative.
|SC|I'm repeating it to these guys that are getting suited here, see.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I have your vector now, you can go back to block.
|SC|Okay, we'll go to block.
|SC|Yes.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. You owe us a reveri fication of the docking tunnel index angle.
|SC|Okay, let me check it.
|SC|Well, I kept thinking it might move back to zero, but it hasn't moved - plus 1.2.
|CAPCOM|Okay, plus 1.2. For your information, Ron, on consummables this morning, we're running 6 percent above the flight plan line on RCS. On the hydrogen, we're about 8 percent above the line on tank 2, right on the lines on the other 2 hydrogen tanks. And on the 02, we're running our standard 4 to 5 percent below the line on oxygen tank 1, tank 2 is right on and tank 3 has now gained to about 3 percent above the line. All looking good.
|SC|Okay, Houston, hey, that's mighty fine.
|SC|Hello, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, I'll give you the Commanders food from yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Alright, ready to copy.

Okay in Meal C: Potato soup, beef and gravy, chicken stew, orange GF drink, tea, chocolate bar, and a package of pecans. Okay CMP medical log: P RD 15034, and about 5 and 1/2 of good sleep; a little trouble getting to sleep last night and I woke up early this morning. I took a seconal, didn't seem to have much good - much effect, and had 4 cans of water.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I think I was on the biomed all the time last night too, so you can check out that sleep.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, while you've got that book with you, I can give you a one-line change to the E memory load as a result of our changing the short burn constant.
|SC|Okay, stand by one there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 08:24 GET 107:30 MC-383/1

|CAPCOM|Okay, it's page 1-43. It's load DELTA. Identifier #5 the old value is 01606, change that to 01637.
|SC|Okay. Be load DELTA and the octal identifier 05 and it's new value is 01637.
|CAPCOM|That's correct.
|SC|Okay. The LMP has got his suit on. They're connecting up the1LCG water connection. And he's still unzipped.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. In the flight plan you're coming up on a VERB 45 and then go into POO prior to the P52. After going to POO we'd like you to change to BD roll from AC. Over.
|SC|Okay, we'll change the BD roll. Looks like we're going to run into a problem on our P52 down here, with these guys getting suited. Is it really necessary now?
|CAPCOM|There's no time criticality on that. When they're out of the way, go ahead with it.
|SC|Okay. Good.
|SC|Okay, Houston. How do you read the LMP?
|CAPCOM|LMP is loud and clear.

|SC|You're right. Here's one.
|CAPCOM|And if there's any - if there's no reason why not, we'd just as soon you go ahead and do the P52 now. Finish that off and then start the maneuver. Over.
|SC|Okay. The big reason is that Gene's getting into his suit right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|As soon as he gets out and gets in his suit we'll all do a P52 maneuver.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston. Can you give us AUTO on the high-gain?
|SC|Okay. Just a second Houston.
|SC|We're transferring to LM power, Houston.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 08:47 CST 107:54 GET MC-385/1
107:54:00|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston; we've taken a look at stars available in the undock attitude and they don't look too good. We suggest you use the present attitude for your 52 and then maneuver. Over.
|SC|Okay, I'm just about to get Gene out of the way here and then I will.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we're less than 3 minutes to LOS now, so when you finish that 52 we'd like you to copy down the NOUN 5 and 93*s for us.
|SC|Okay, will do.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, about 1 minute to LOS. Nothing further you, we'll see you on the other side.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, we're hustling like hell, we mi gh t make i t.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107:59 ground elapsed time into the mission of Apollo 17. We've had loss of signal at this time as Apollo 17 coasted behind the Moon on the tenth lunar orbit. Approximately 47 minutes until the spacecraft both come around the far side as the crew prepares to transfer into the lunar module; that is, Cernan and Schmitt prepare to transfer into the lunar module. Get it powered up in preparation for today's activities of the descent orbit insertion maneuver number 2 and ultimately the landing at Taurus-Littrow and the first extravehicular activity. As they come around the Moon on the eleventh revolution, they will have checked out the lunar module with a few exceptions such as they will deploy the landing gear after acquistion of signal. Also at that time, both spacecraft, Challenger and America, though still docked, will be on separate air to ground links. The lunar module will be on the normal channel; the command service module link, with Ron Evans, will be piped into Room 161 in the News Center building for those newsmen covering the mission who prefer to listen to the command service module orbital science activities. As Apollo 17 went behind the western limb of the Moon, the orbit measured 12 nautical miles at pericynthion and 60.2 at apocynthion. Some maneuvers coming up - the next major maneuver for the lunar module will be the descent orbit insertion number 2 which at this time is predicted, or is calculated to take place at a ground elapsed time of 112 hours 1 minute 59.1 seconds. Total burn time of 21.8 seconds. For a Delta V or velocity change of 7.6 feet per second, which will change the orbit to an apocynthion of 60.4 nautical miles and a pe ri cy n thion j or nearest approach, which is just uprange of the landing site, of 6.7 nautical miles.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12711/72 08:47 CST 107:54 GET MC-385/2
107:54:00|PAO|The big maneuver of the day, of course, is powered descent and landing, which at this time is calculated to take place at a ground elapsed time of 112 hours 49 minutes 27 seconds, lasting 11 minutes and 57 seconds, plus whatever hover time is available as they get down to the landing site. Total Delta V, or velocity change, to get out of orbit and break into the descent pass and ultimately the hovering and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow is 6693 feet per second. Some 43 minutes now away from acquisition as Apollo 17, America and Challenger, come from behind the Moon on orbit number 11. And at 108:04 ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST9:38 GET108:45 386/1
008:45:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 108 hours 44 minutes ground elapsed time. Less than 2 minutes away from acquisition as America and Challenger, the spacecraft of Apollo 17, come around from behind the Moon on lunar orbit number 11. At that time the voice downlinks from both spacecrafts will be separated. For those, newsmen in Houston, who wish to listen to the voice from Ron Evans in the command service module, this will be available in room 161 in the Newscenter Office Wing. At the time the spacecraft reappears from behind the Moon, the crew should have completed most of the lunar module checkout procedures, and be prepared for deploying the landing gear, and a series of communication checks with the ground. Just before loss of signal on the eleventh revolution, the crew will be given a GO NO-GO for undocking and separation, which will take place during the time when the spacecraft is behind the Moon near the end of revolution number 11. In other words, when they reappear again, they will be flying separately on the twelfth revolution. We should have acquisition any moment, now, we've counted down to zero on the acquisition of signal clocks here in the Control Center. It takes a few seconds for the ground to lock up solidly with the downlink signal with the spacecraft. Network reports acquisition of signal, let's bring up the line and listen for the first call.
|CHALLENGER|There we go, we should have done that in the first place.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, this is Houston. How do you read?
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Hello, Gordie, this is Challenger, we read you loud and clear.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're readable - lots of back ground noises at the moment.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'll update you in just a minute.

|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston, I'm pretty sure the VHF is all right - -
|AMERICA|Okay-
|CHALLENGER|It seems to have something to do with the squelch setting and it's probably because we're so close.

|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo, we are - here's a couple of quick ones. When I push the LCG DSKY breaker in, I did not get a restart light. The keyboard came up with 400 in R2. The LCG light was already on and it went off as prescribed. When I did a VERB 35 I got all the proper lights except when the LGC and ISS lights came on, the entire caution and warning dimmed. One more item. In our DAP setting, we are reading in our checklist, for R-l, plus 645 and for R-2 plus 641, the DSKY DAP came up plus 641 and plus 645 it just reversed those numbers.

|AMERICA|Okay, dock and probe circuit breakers, 2 of them are going closed.
|AMERICA|Main A, Main B.
|AMERICA|Probe extend release end is going to -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, those angles are okay.
|AMERICA|(garble) ah ha, I got 2 barber poles.
|CAPCOM|That's a go, Ron.
|CHALLENGER|I kind of figured they were, they're going in.
|AMERICA|Lock and probe circuit breakers are going OPEN.
|AMERICA|Okay, extend release is - and they went grey of course when they went OPEN. Okay entend releases to OFF.
|AMERICA|Verify probe extend latch engaged and computer is not visible. I handled those a while ago, but I'll go look again.
|AMERICA|It's only a hit EXTEND, with the circuit b re akers in .
|AMERICA|Mighty fine, it's still back inside there; extend latches still engaged.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ron, on my MARK, I'd like an 0620.
|AMERICA|Okay, standing by, go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, 3, 2, 1, MARK it.
|AMERICA|Okay 000.44, 104.63, 359.69.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, got those.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger, we've got those angles here on the ground -
|CHALLENGER|Okay -
|CAPCOM|- both spacecraft.
|CHALLENGER|Fine Gordy.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, ED batt, 37.2, 37.2 and 109 14 00.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|And all battery indications onboard were normal, once I got started.
|CAPCOM|Okay, they look good to us also.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, in order to get on and stay on -
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I want you to stay in that min dead-band (garble) P52.
|CAPCOM|- the timeline (garble) 10 minutes after PDI we can let that one go, and if you'd like to let the camera business slide till after your suit check and we'll get those things, I'll come back and remind you of those too.
|AMERICA|Okay, I've got the cameras all set - I got them out anyway, I don't have the right values on the lenses yet but anyhow the cameras are out and they're loaded.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 09:59 CST 109:56 GET MC-388/3
109:56:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, this is the LMP -
|CHALLENGER|- couple minor things on the back pack check out. The secondary glycol pump, when I started it, the sound and the pressure was ragged, isolated around - 20 psi and then stabilized. About 15 seconds, it sounded smooth; it had a sound as if it was cavitating a little bit, but after that it was s mooth, over.
|CAPCOM|Copy that Jack.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, why don't I go ahead and get the PGA ve r out of the way -
|CHALLENGER|And step 3 on page 3-15 -
|AMERICA|I rather get the data first.
|CHALLENGER|When I went to deadband one, I got a master alarm -
|CAPCOM|Why don't we go ahead and get the PGA and I'm -
|CHALLENGER|- but all other indications were okay, and the master alarm reset.
|CAPCOM|- and could you tell me if you ever got around to playing with the squelch on the VHF?
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|(garble) I'm sorry I -
|CHALLENGER|(garble) -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 10:10 GET 109:17 MC_389/1
109:17:00|CHALLENGER|I'm sorry, I misinterpreted the words there, I should have gotten that. Forget that one.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|And -
|CAPCOM|We concur,
|CHALLENGER|We are squelch A now. We've got it all the way down to 1 and I still don't hear them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you did get a satisfactory check on your side didn't you?
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Geno, you need some help?
|CHALLENGER|Oh, yes.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I've got to satisfy you - every once in awhile I can hear them now, they're cutting in and out somewhere, I don't know where.
|CAPCOM|Alrighty.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, squelch A and ACCEPT is set about 4.
|CAPCOM|Okay, America, we'll give you a state vector if you'll give us ACCEPT.
|AMERICA|Okay, you have it.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|What star have you got, 30? Or no, what star? Loaded it, A, A and those are the numbers. Looks good. Okay, you ready to mark? What do you want first? No, good on e.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'd like to take a look at the glycol pump pressure. Can you close the glycol pump secondary pressure breaker?
|CHALLENGER|Better finish this.
|CHALLENGER|Gordie, you want the secondary?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, panel 16 glycol pump secondary breaker - third row in the middle.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we've got a glycol light, and the temperature is 50.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the pressure looked good there, without that breaker back open. The master alarm you have is normal.
|CHALLENGER|Roger, understand it.
|AMERICA|Houston, America. How much time till AOS yet - or LOS?
|CAPCOM|Oh, about 29 minutes.
|AMERICA|Okay. Have a little time for the PGA there, then, I guess.
|CAPCOM|And it's your computer any time you want to get to it, Ron.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Ahah, I have the old Hamilton Blues on.
|AMERICA|More cables all over the place than I know what to do with.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 10:10 GET 109:17 MC-389/2
109:17:00|CAPCOM|That place looks like a pig pen, you've run the same course everybody else has I guess.
|AMERICA|(laughter) I've got cables and hoses and -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 10:20 CST 109:27 GET MC390/1
109:27:00|AMERICA|Okay, hit the stick again. Now I've got to unlock it.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, keep in mid deadband and hold. I've got to finish the P52.
|AMERICA|Okay, you want me to move her back to attitude now or just -
|CHALLENGER|No, just stay where you are.
|AMERICA|We're on attitude just a little bit.
|CHALLENGER|Just stay where you are. Put it in mid deadband.
|AMERICA|Well, I'm on mid deadband but i've maneuvered out of attitude. You want to go back to regular a t ti t ude ?
|CHALLENGER|No. NO, no.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, (garble) return is closed, mid flow valves. The other 2 are closed. Mine is open and I got the interconnection between the other ones.
|CAPCOM|Sounds good.
|AMERICA|And we'll (garble) pressure. Okay, looks like pretty good. Okay 02 flow is lower limit. Okay, we'll scoop the press. Here we go. It's going up to press. And it feels like it's going up. And (garble) here now (garble). 0 2 flow high.
|CHALLENGER|Hey Ron. This is Challenger. We're going to be off your loop for awhile so we can finish the marks.
|AMERICA|Okay, wait a minute Jack, I'll just go to receive on the VHF. I'll just go to receive on the VHF, J a ck .
|AMERICA|Okay, let's see, there's a Delta P in the book. Six and a half - how are we going to cycle 6 (garble) return here? Okay, it's out, it's back in. Okay, now we can squirt a little more 02 flow in. Uh, Hu - there we go. Now, man. Direct 02 is off. It's coming down. Gee, I read 4.5 in my suit. Is that right? By.
|CAPCOM|Looks like - looks like about 4 on our me ter, Ron.
|AMERICA|Well, I'll be darn. The suit gage reads 4.5. They wasn't that close in there. 6, 8, - maybe 9 or something like that. That's closer to 4. I can't tell for sure what it feels like. They have 02 closed down. Not leaking very much. I'm reading about a .3, something like that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're - we're showing 4.2 to 4.3 on our pressure spread near cabin and 2 pressure gauges probably show something similar.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 10:20 CST 109:27 GET MC390/2
109:27:00|CAPCOM|And we show that the flow rate is down.
|AMERICA|All right, that's not too bad. That's p re t ty c lo s e .
|CAPCOM|Yeah, and the 02 flow is staying pretty good.
|AMERICA|(garble) on this thing, huh?
|CAPCOM|Sounds good.
|AMERICA|Okay, so it looks like it's stable there, isn't it?
|CAPCOM|Yes sir.
|AMERICA|Okay, let's do the depress. (garble) my ears are pretty good. If you guys don't care, I m going to go to OFF, Save a little time, here.
|CAPCOM|America, I don't know if I copied you corectly. You don't want to go to off on two tests valves until pressures are back down to normal. If that was what you asked.
|AMERICA|(laughter) Hello Houston.
|CAPCOM|Or are you already there?
|AMERICA|That looked to be a pretty good alignment from where I saw it. There's 07 for you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy.
|AMERICA|Yeah, my ears are popping to beat the band. I changed my mind. I'11 let it go down slowly.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we've got about 20 minutes before LOS so while there's no hurry on those pads I've got them standing by when you're ready. And didn't know what you -what you had in mind about working on these things. We might get - We might get started on the hatch integrity check if you get to that point and I - (interruption)
|AMERICA|Okay, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|(garble) for it to bleed down or whatever turns out to be convenient.
|AMERICA|Okay, let's see. I guess it's about time to - to recyc okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Hello, America, Challenger. We no longer need you. This is deadband.
|CAPCOM|(garble through interruption by Challenger).
|AMERICA|Okay Challenger, America here. I'll go b ack to CMC.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, but I would like NOUN 20 from you on my mark.

|CAPCOM|Roger. We're with you.
|AMERICA|Okay, Challenger, America -
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead, Ron.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm going to turn off B-3 and also my roll jet and undo the docking latches.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you want to verify your transponder is OFF as well as B-3?
|AMERICA|That's verified, transponder is OFF.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and you did get the umbilicals, right?
|AMERICA|Say again about umbilicals.
|CHALLENGER|You did get the LM to CM umbilicals, right?
|AMERICA|No, all I get is umbilicals, I didn't get the question.
|CHALLENGER|Did you disconnect the LM to CM umbilicals, ve ri fiy .
|AMERICA|Verify, I have those down here.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Very good.
|AMERICA|And jet Bravo 3 is off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron we're about 5 minutes from LOS and - and the only thing that you will be able to (inaudible)
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. We cannot completely explain the start up indications you had on the PNGS, but they are of no great concern. It looks good so far, the DAP Gimbal Trims are no problem. Don't bother changing them. And there will be no PIP A bias update, yet anyway. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, understand. Was the checklist written backwards on this.
|CAPCOM|There was a Cape problem on there tape and they had it reversed. But, it's in a noise level anyway, no p roblem.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. You have a GO for undocking and sep.
|CHALLENGER|Roger, understand. A GO for undocking and sep.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, number 5.
|CHALLENGER|1, 2, and it's fully released and the hook is off the docking ring.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, number 6. Is 1, 2 and it's fully released and the hook is off the docking ring.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, 7 is released and the hook is off the docking ring.
|CHALLENGER|02 flow still okay?
|CAPCOM|Yes sir, looking good.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Here's number 8.
|CHALLENGER|1, 2 and the shoots's fully released and the hook is off the docking ring.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston. Number 9. 1, 2 and she's fully released and the hook clears the docking ring.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, number 10. There's 1, 2 fully released and it clears the docking ring.
|CHALLENGER|Ah, 1, 11, Okay, handle free, J-hook clears the ring. Only got one more to go. There first latch, that's
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 10:40 GET 109:47 MC-392/2
109:47:00|CHALLENGER|2 latches, sounded like it came over and that stays clear, handle is free. Now, by golly they're all off.
|AMERICA|Hey, Challenger, you're hanging on to those three little bitty things.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, fine Ron.
|AMERICA|Okay, put the old - -
|CAPCOM|Challenger, you still have about 1 minute to LOS and we'll see you when you come around the other side independantly.
|AMERICA|Hatch in.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo, understand - -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we're within a minute of LOS. 02 flow still looks good, and the rest of the stuff we can get on VHF is coming in just fine.
|CHALLENGER|(garble)
|AMERICA|Okay, I'll get that VHF stuff and then put the hatch in .
|CAPCOM|Jack, just a friendly reminder to do the LOS procedures on the steerable.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay we're ready to receive only to B DATA.
|AMERICA|Hey Challenger, America I'm going to receive only B data.
|AMERICA|Hey Challenger (static)
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had LOS of signal as America and Challenger pass behind the Moon on the -toward the end of the 11th Lunar Orbit. When they reappear again approximately 47 minutes, they will be undocked. Station keeping flying along adjacent to each other. At LOS of signal the orbit measured 61.2 nautical miles pericynthion by 12 miles even nautical - pericynthion. Velocity at that time was 5315 feet per second. During the next front-side pass, as the Challenger continues in preparations for the descent orbit insertion we'll have a checkout of the descent propulsion system. The tanks will be pressurized and telemetry readouts here on the ground will be prepared to those on board, to make sure that, that system is preforming as advertised. An alignment - realignment of the inertial measuring unit, part of the lunar module's guidance system will be run during that - also during that frontside pass. And toward the end of the 12th revolution, just prior to LOS of signal the crew aboard Challanger will be given a GO/NO-GO for the Descent Orbit Insertion Maneuver //2, which is at this time still scheduled for a ground elapsed time of 112 hours 1 minute 59 seconds. There's a carton of book matches on top of the flight di re c t o r-c on s o 1 e here In the Control Center which was bought by a group of flight dynamics officers on all the ships. Bill Boone, Jay Green, Jerry Bostick and others. It's a blue match cover, it says The Trench. Traditionally the trench is the front row here in the Control Center where the flight dynamics people operate. It says on the front The Trench, Mission Control Center, Houston. On the reverse of the match book it says Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Apollo Soyuz Test Program Shuttle. Mercury, Gemini and Apollo have a check by them
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 10:40 GET 109:47 MC 392/3
109:47:00|PAO|Indicating tbey're complete. And at the bottom it says roll them out, we're ready. At 109 :57 up live at next acquisition of signal as America and Challenger come around on the 12th revolution, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 11:32 CST 110:39 GET MC-393/1
110:39:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. One hundred ten hours, 39 minutes ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Less than 2 minutes remaining now until America and Challenger separated and flying a few feet apart at this time will come around the front side of the Moon on the 12th lunar orbit. Slightly over a minute now until we should start attempting to lock up on the downlink signal from America and Challenger. The two way communications from spacecraft communicator for the command-service module, Ken Mattingly, and Ron Evans aboard America will be on a separate loop as it was the last revolution. These conversations can be heard in room 161 in the Houston News Center. Early in this revolution we'll have the pressurization of the descent propulsion system and checkout of that system. Some 6-5 seconds from acquisition we'll stand by until Network advises the Flight Director that they do have firm lock on. We have AOS in lunar module, let's see what we h ear.
|CAPCOM|Hello Challenger, Houston, you're very, very w eak, over .
|CHALLENGER|(considerable background noise) Okay, Houston, (garbled) we're looking at America the beautiful.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno I understand we're locked on but we're not reading you (garbled).
|CAPCOM|America, Houston standing by.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, America, we're floating free out here. The Challenger looked real pretty. The residuals on the P41 were plus 1.9, minus .2, and 0; undock and sep was on time.
|CAPCOM|Sounds good.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, this is Challenger. Won't hold on the steerable antenna yet, it looks like I'm getting oscillations in my uplink signal strength and then gradually drops off to zero.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we're reading you better now, un de rs t an d.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo, if you're reading, you got the words we are undocked. Landing radar film test was go. We're ready to press on to the zip tunnel check, and we've been looking at America the beautiful on its rare form.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, we've got that. It sounds good.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and the residuals on 247 at undocking we're at 0 minus .1 and 0.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. We'd like you to try the steerable again.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston, we've got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you sound real good, loud and clear.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, let me give you some NOUN 20 angles, if you want them.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead. Ready to copy.

|CHALLENGER|Okay, looks good on board. About 2 40 both si de s.
|CAPCOM|Okay, looks good on the ground.
|CHALLENGER|Say, Gordy, this thing sounds a little bit like my stomach sounded a couple of days ago.
|CAPCOM|Roger that.
|CHALLENGER|AGS coming on to standby.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, master ARM and AGS light.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, (garble) 110 5200 for the time on the AGS.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Oh, Gene—0, we showed Jack's suit iso valve in suit disconnect. Should be in suit flow. Would you check that for - for us, please?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, he's in suit flow now.

|CHALLENGER|I'll tell you - I'll tell you this LCG sure makes a world of difference up here.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, America, Challenger.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Ron, listen. This ridge you're coming on over - just stick your hand out the hatch and grab a rock.
|CHALLENGER|Well, when you're looking at where you are it even looks1lower.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. I have a new AGS K vector for you.
|CHALLENGER|Stand by a second.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 11:50 CST 110:57 GET MC-395/1

|CAPCOM|Okay, it's 109:59:59.94, over.
|CHALLENGER|109:59:59.94.
|CAPCOM|That's right.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, this is spectacular. It is absolutely spectacular looking at that command module, America down there coming across the surface. We're just tracking them at about a 30 degree dive angle.
|CAPCOM|Sounds great.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, babe, have a good time, and go get that landmark. Don't forget TEIC in about 3 days.
|CAPCOM|Geno, Houston with a couple of items.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Okay, your perilune seems to be -
|CHALLENGER|Hey, we got the landing site Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll hold -
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, we got the landing site, we're coming right over the front of it; stand by a minute, you can see the Slide, I think you can see the Great Cross.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|We'll get a picture of America coming right across it.
|CAPCOM|All righty.
|CHALLENGER|Super targeting. God, we've got Family Mountain, we've got Corsa Massif; we can see the Scarp, we can see the light mantle; I've got the Great Cross, Camelot, Sherlock, believe it or not, Houston, they're all there.
|CAPCOM|How about that.
|CHALLENGER|I see possible structure - possible structure in the upper part of the South Massif, little bit east of station 2. It's some horizontal, dipping to the southeast. Houston, I can even see Poppy, right where we're going to set this baby down.
|CAPCOM|Very good.
|CHALLENGER|As a matter of fact, I can see Rudolph. I can even see the triangle: Rudolph, Frosty and Punk.
|CHALLENGER|Man, Gordo, this is absolutely spectacular.
|CAPCOM|Sure sounds like it.
|CHALLENGER|We can watch Ron track - we can watch Ron track right on through the landmarks, I don't what kind of results he got, but he had a nice smooth track from here.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, you can go ahead and update us with th o s e words.
|CAPCOM|Okay, your perilune is shifting west PDI will be a little higher than nominal: 10.7 miles or 65 000 feet; should be no problem. And from the time you first came around till we had a solid lock up on the steerable on this acquisition was about 3 minutes, we're going to try to speed that up some on the next time around. We'd like you to just keep trying the steerable until we come to you - and say stop trying. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy understand that and apparently this time, had I let — had I waited a little longer, it would

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 12:40 CST 111:47 GET MC-400/1
111:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we've had loss of signal as America and Challenger coasting along near-by each other, passed behind the Moon on revolution number 12. Some 47 minutes until they come back around again, on the 13th lunar revolution. Behind the Moon this time, the command/service module piloted by Ron Evans will do CSM circularization maneuver which will place the spacecraft back up into an almost circular lunar orbit, measuring 69.7 by 54.5, those are the targeted measurements of that orbit. Ignition time, again which will be behind the Moon and out of contact is ground elapsed time of 111:57:28. The lunar module DOI, or descent orbit insertion burn number 2 also will be behind the Moon before we reacquire the spacecraft. That is scheduled for 112 hours 2 minutes 40 seconds. It's a fairly small burn 7.6 feet per second which will lower the pericynthion of the Challenger down to 6 1/2 miles - nautical miles with apocynthion staying at 61.5 nautical miles. During the next front side pass, comes the moment of truth with powered descent, and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow landing site as Challenger lights off the big descent engine at 112 hours 49 minutes, 52 seconds ground elapsed time. The ignition countdown clock in the control center is counting down to PDI some 59 minutes 17 - 16 seconds until ignition with landing shortly under 12 minutes later, depending on the amount of hover time available. The broadcast line will be brought up again just prior to acquisition of signal as America and Challenger come around on the front side again on revolution 13, and at 111 hours 51 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 13:26 CST 112:33 GET MC401/1
112:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 112 hours 33 minutes ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Coming up on acquisition of signal with both spacecrafts, America and Challenger coming from behind the moon on the thirteenth lunar orbit. Some 1 minute 32 seconds away from acquisition of the command module and slightly under three minutes on the lunar module, Challenger. Challenger, during this revolution will descend to the surface of the moon and land at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. Ignition time currently is ground elapsed time of 112 hours 49 minutes 52 seconds. During the descent to the surface the spacecraft onboard computer will be generating numbers on the display which the lunar module pilot will call out to the commander and which - angles at which the commander should be able to see the landing site through a grid etched on the left hand window of the lunar module. Here, we have AOS. AOS of the command service module and the circulars - the circularization burn was good. This is Apollo Control on the air-ground 2 circuit. Command module pilot, Ron Evans, is giving the CAPCOM all of the residuals. Here comes Challenger. Back to the lunar landing sequence as the lunar module pilot reads out the angles that the commander ought to be able to see the landing site. The commander is able to run through an operation called redes ignation by using a pitch hand controller to rotate the spacecraft.
|CAPCOM|Okay Challenger, you're loud and clear on the OMNI. How did it go?
|CHALLENGER|Okay. The burn was go. We're in a seven mile perigee into PGNCS and we had 0 plus .1 and plus .1 res i duals .
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds good.
|CHALLENGER|Ok - Okay, Gordy, I'm going to try the high-gain. I had you locked up once and then I lost you. Let me try it again.
|CAPCOM|We concur. Go ahead, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Okay Gordy, that's mighty fine. You know you're uplinking. You've got the OMNI and i'll leave i t .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll stay on the OMNI for the uplink.

|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds great. Both systems are GO. Right on the line.
|CHALLENGER|You're looking at DELTA H.
|CAPCOM|And you're GO for a VERB 57.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, VERB 57 is in. Hey Houston, is the AGS out-of-plane, correct?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, coming up on 5 minutes, Jack let's take a check at it. About 74 degrees.
|CHALLENGER|That's good.
|CHALLENGER|70 feet per second we're coming down (garble)
|CAPCOM|Challenger you're GO in 5 minutes, looks ok ay to us .

|CHALLENGER|Okay, parker valves -
|CHALLENGER|Boy, you bet it is, Gordo.
|CHALLENGER|Boy, when you said shut down, I shut down and we'dropped, didn't we?
|CHALLENGER|Yes, sir, but we is here, man is we here. How does that look?
|CHALLENGER|Pressures look great, tank 2 is down just a little from before, engine override is OFF, manifold is great, manifold is right on, Go to jets.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I am jets.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, that sides complete. Houston, you can tell America that Challenger is at Taurus-Littrow.
|CAPCOM|We'11 do it.
|CHALLENGER|Great. Ron, I had the meatball all the way. Beautiful. Jack, are we going to have some nice boulders in this area. Okay the old cameras off.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Landing radar breaker, OPEN. Checking the water. And Gordie, ascent tank 1, we started out a little low, it's still at the same place, that's water.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Batteries look good.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, man. Look at that rock out there. Absolutely incredible. Absolutely incredible. I think I can see the rim of Camelot.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Greatest moment of my life.
|CHALLENGER|Where'd you land?
|CHALLENGER|You never let me look outside at all. Hey, you can see the boulder tracks.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie, we're standing by for your GO, we're looking good onboard.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're looking great here so -
|CHALLENGER|Man, there's boulders all over those Massiffs. Man, look at that propellent, we could have gone all around and looked around.
|CHALLENGER|We should have hovered around a little bit, gone and looked at the Scarp.
|CHALLENGER|No, thank you. I like it right where we are .
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie, while you're waiting on that GO, I had to - I shot for a spot, around 2 o'clock from
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 13:48 GET 112:55 403/4
112:55:00|CHALLENGER|Poppy. There are a number of boulders out at 12 o'clock from Poppy and I really think I'm probably not more than about 100 meters out in front of it, and slightly to the north. Actually, I may be a little bit closer to Trident then I expected Poppy to be. I think I've got Trident right out the left window. And our first cut at the mobility around here in the Rover ought to be super.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds good.
|CHALLENGER|But I tell you, the Massif and Bear Mountain are 2 different products. They look it, don't they? Of course, they're different slopes, too. I think you're looking - probably, that may be Rudolph, right there, Jack, out your window.
|CHALLENGER|I was looking more at those boulders and trying to stay in the spots in between them than I was in relationship to that crater.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, you did great. And there was practically no dust, just a little bit of a film, you had the ground, all the way to the ground.
|CHALLENGER|Yes.
|CHALLENGER|I could call touchdown on the Shadow. Look at that.
|CHALLENGER|Really here. (laughs)
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy, we're hanging in for your Go.
|CHALLENGER|It better be a GO.
|CHALLENGER|I'll check everything again. Let's just double check. Okay. That hasn't changed.
|CHALLENGER|It looks good.
|CHALLENGER|The manifold hasn't changed.
|CHALLENGER|The RCS hasn't changed.-
|CHALLENGER|Ascent water hasn't changed. The batteries haven't changed.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, my golly, only we have changed.
|CHALLENGER|You know, you can't see into Camelot, Jack, that rim is Camelot out in front of us.
|CAPCOM|You'll be glad to hear your stay is for T-l.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|America, we have a stay for T-l.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, you're a smooth talker.
|CHALLENGER|Stay for T-l.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, let's find out where we are.
|CHALLENGER|Engine stop is reset.
|CHALLENGER|The AGS is ready for us if we need it.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I need a P-12 time as soon as I get 60 (garbled)
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy, you're looking at NOUN 43.
|CHALLENGER|Copy that down, Jack, right here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 13:48 GET 112:55 403/5
112:55:00|CHALLENGER|20 21 and 30 75 and I'm going to P-12. Okay. I need a P-12 time from you.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. For T-2 the time is 113 14 2491 491.
|CHALLENGER|Yes.
|CHALLENGER|I can't feel any difference between one- sixth g and anything else right now.
|CHALLENGER|Well, you still have your restraints on. ( laughing)
|CHALLENGER|Okay. 113 142491. Are you happy with that.
|CHALLENGER|That looks good, sir.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. I gotta change these numbers?
|CHALLENGER|You didn't get an update on NOUN 76 did you?
|CHALLENGER|I don't think so. No.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|No. Okay, 5515. Hello, Gordy, how would you like me to handle R3 of NOUN 76?
|CAPCOM|Standby, I'll come back to you.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|That radar performed super.
|CHALLENGER|How was the view on the way down, Gene? (laughing)
|CHALLENGER|You know after we pitched over I was just looking for a place to land. And I'm not sure. I just didn't want to hit one of those boulders out there which would have been - look at that. Look right in front of us. I didn't want to land there either.
|CHALLENGER|I see that one right in front of us.
|CHALLENGER|See that. That's a boulder.
|CHALLENGER|That's a hole.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. R3 south range is okay as is.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 14:01 CST 113:10 GET MC-404/1
113:10:00|CAPCOM|R3, South range is okay as is .
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Okay, we're coming up -
|CHALLENGER|- we're in posture for a T-2, Gordy. Okay I can see the Scarp, I can see Hanover, good thing we'didn't plan to go to Hanover, it's steep. Look at the boulder tracks half way up the hill. Yeah, there not halfway just enough.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, they're boulder tracks, they're beautiful.
|CHALLENGER|It's sitting right there in the end of the tracks. There's tracks all over that hill side. There's a boulder came right down to the surface, see it, that one right through that little crater -
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, sitting right there for us to sample. Look at it. Yes sir. I'll bet Bear Mountain and the Sculptured Hills, are the same.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, well the slope's different, we'll have to look at it from outside, you may be right.
|CHALLENGER|Now I see why they call them sculptured. They re so hummocky that there's shadows all over them.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, there's some holes and rocks around here who told me this was a flat landing site?
|CHALLENGER|It is flat. For crying out loud what do you want, an air tight guarantee? Let's see, we got about 2 degrees left and about 5 degrees pitch up.
|CHALLENGER|We're about what - about 100 meters from Iri den t ?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah - yeah, less than that, I think Irident's ri gh t h e re .
|CHALLENGER|Our shadow's about 100 feet, Geno, I think.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, we're only about - yeah less than 100 meters then1It doesn't look that long but it -
|CHALLENGER|There's some holes I'm glad I didn't land in around here, I'll tell you.
|CHALLENGER|Now, if you look at the Massif, Jack, I don't know xf you can see it over here, you see, there almost like a series of linear boulder tracks, but they come cross-ways down the slope, so it looks like there may very definetly be some -some jointed - there's outcrop on top the Massif.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, it sure looks like it, grey outcrop.
|CHALLENGER|And there's a bluish grey compared to the brown or tan grey of the Massif side, and a lot of that boulder is a lot of that outcrop down on the bottom is boulders.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, do you know what that reminds me of way up on top - that outcrop? That reminds me of sunset where you could just get a little piece of outcrop around the corner That's right.
|CAPCOM|And America have pan camera photo pad, are you ready for it? It'll go on page 129.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, let's see what we're doing, we got 3 minutes for G-2, let'' s take another check.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 14:01 CST 113:10 GET MC-404/2
113:10:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, I just looked at 'em.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, SF looks good.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, I noticed something every since we've landed, the oxidizer quantity went from - from 7 or 8, and not it's down to 2 and the fuel has stayed constant.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|And the quantity light came on somewhere I believe after we landed. Yeah it did.
|CHALLENGER|I noticed the quantity light also, I was thinking re g light though when I saw it. Oh man.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, we'll have a story on that for you later, we'don't think we were really low level.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, it doesn't make any difference now Gordy, except to talk about when we get home.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|And we're 2 minutes and counting to T-2.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|We better hurry if - they're going to give us the go.
|CHALLENGER|How about some water?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, you can zap me.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, I tell you, that's something everyone's got to do once in their life, I want to -
|CHALLENGER|We're not going to have much time for T-2 -
|CAPCOM|Challenger you're stay for T-2 and go for th e DP S ven t.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and stay for T-2 and go for the DPS ven t .
|CHALLENGER|Let me get out of - okay we can't hack that, I'm going to get out at 12 2's good.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you can unzap that water, if you'd like and let's go off VOX, let's go on PTT.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We mark the unofficial landing time at 113 hours 1 minute, 52 seconds ground elapsed time. And, from the description, the unofficial landing site is about 100 meters beyond the crater Poppy -
|CHALLENGER|Houston, oxidizer fuel vents coming open.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Master arm on, master arm's coming on.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Gordo, I got 2 good lights.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|CHALLENGER|Detent vent fire.
|CHALLENGER|Okay MARK it, now we'did not hear anything on that one Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Pressure's coming down though, pressure's coming down. Okay master arm OFF. Okay we'll monitor oxidizer pressure 20 to 40 and then OX vent CLOSED, fuel pressure to ACTIVATE fuel vent Descent quantity lights, reg light, excuse me.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, mode control 2 to att hold, well we can keep going I guess.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 14:01 CST 113:10 GET MC-404/3
113:10:00|CHALLENGER|Yeah, hey, we can press on. Okay. Okay now wait a minute, here we go, let's get that, go up here first, because I haven't selected" it.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, ECA control is CLOSED, three is back on, battery 5 is OFF reset and it's off the line, battery 6 off reset and it's off the line, burner number 2, breakers in, burner 2, let me check the voltage, voltage is great. Okay, keep going.
|CHALLENGER|Descent engine override's OPEN. Ascent ECA's controls OPEN; (garble) cycling, cycled, both lights are out. Okay, cabin pressure is good, okay and then A and B going to CABIN, A is to CABIN, B is to CABIN, full egress, return is EGRESS, repress going to AUTO, Stand by for a noise, there you go it's in AUTO. Okay, now it's your turn.
|CHALLENGER|Verified. Wonder where it's going, out I guess.
|CHALLENGER|Burner 2 is selected.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 14:10 CST 113:19 GET MC405/1
113:19:00|CHALLENGER|(garble) power, open. Guess what? Take your helmet and gloves off.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy, we're In 1-1. Helmets and gloves are off. Converter valves are IV.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We're right with you.
|CHALLENGER|And you're looking at NOUN 20.
|CHALLENGER|(garble) shades are going closed.
|CHALLENGER|I just - I'm using it instead of a light switch because I've got to cover it up.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, You got NOUN 20?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. We copy NOUN 20.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Jack, you want to pick up the AGS on the right side of the page and I'll park the antenna.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|P20 did work. Correction, P57 did wo rk.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. You're DPS oxidizer pressure is 40 or less. You can close it.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you, Gordy.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, while the P57 is doing it's gravity work, let me say that the LNA and the landing site, from a relief point of view, I think are identical. I couldn't say enough for the LNA. I actually didn't look around nearly as much as I thought I would, or as I wanted to because I had fixation on a reasonable spot to land. They're not all reasonable in that - there's some very subtle hummocky like craters right in and around where we are and there's not a - a lot of boulders laying on the surface but there's a lot of what appear to be boulders that are covered up by some of the dark mantle - numerous enough that you would not like to take a chance at putting a - a pad down on one of them or in one of those hummocky subtle craters. As a result, I really didn't have a chance to look all around at where I wanted to except to put the bird down where I wanted i t .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got no complaint with that.
|CHALLENGER|I guess the thing that probably - probably surprised me most about the site as far as landing is concerned is the fact that there were these - these - I hesitate to say they're outcrops but certainly they're buried massive pieces of rock, whether they're boulders or not we'll have to find out. Out here in the plains area, partially covered and fillited by the dark mantle. And I expected to find a number of craters but I guess 1 really didn't expect to find - to find the - the rock types around
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 14:10 CST 113:19 GET MC405/2
113:19:00|CHALLENGER|and we're talking about anywhere from 1 to 2 meters down to oh 2 or 3 feet which when their sticking out and on the sides of some of these subtle craters look pretty menacing. But, that's probably the one thing that surprised me the most.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|CHALLENGER|The visibility prior to pitch over was such that I could see Nansen. I could see the scarp I could see Lara. I could not see Camelot until after pitch over. However, once I had pitch over if I might could have froze it right there like we'did a simulator occasionally. I could have picked out everything there was to see. Even at 6 000 feet the small triangle with Frosty and Rudolph and Punk were visible to me. I had Poppy from orbit as a matter of fact so it was easy to see. Barjea was a very sharp round crater just as depicted on the LNA. The thing I really didn't get a good look at because I didn't pay too much attention to it was Trident on to the South.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, this is the LMP. Let me say - Gordie this is the LMP let me say that the inside of the spacecraft looks just like the simulator.
|CAPCOM|Very good Jack.
|SC|Another interesting thing, Gordy. All the way through PDI prior to pitch over Jack and I had the real America or the other America right out smack out the front window all the way down which was pretty spectatular.
|CAPCOM|I bet it was and you can consider your self stay for T3.
|SC|Thank you sir, your getting smoother all the time. If your happy with NOUN 22 I'll pro.
|CAPCOM|Stand by 1. Your clear to pro.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 14:20 CST 113:29 GET MC-406/1
113:29:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy, I had the angles matched on the steerable and1went to slew and they - and it held for a few seconds and then1dropped off.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It looks pretty good. You might try to peak it up1just a little more.
|CHALLENGER|No, we're on an OMNI now.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|CHALLENGER|I'll try the steerable one more time here.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're on the steerable and I'm not going to touch it.
|CHALLENGER|It's steerable and slew, and I got 3.8.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that looks good to us, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'd like you to verify the tape re corde r off.
|CHALLENGER|That's verified, Gordy.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, how did the fuel vent look to you?
|CAPCOM|Okay, looks like 8 to us, you can go ahead and -
|CHALLENGER|Anyway - okay, I already did.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 14:30 CST 113:39 GET MC-407/1
113:39:00|CHALLENGER|Gordy, I guess I'm puzzled on that one, I had the right star. You see anything we'did wrong.
|CAPCOM|Stand by we're checking.
|CHALLENGER|Gene, our only guess in that you might have loaded NOUN 88 wrong, we'd like you to start over, and we'll watch you real close again.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, listening, I think we know what we did, we load Sprial for Cursor and Cursor for Spiral. How would it be if we went through the P57 again and yeah - we'll - I guess we got to do it all over, those old numbers are no good any more.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|I - I'm sure that's what we'did, we loaded Cursor for Spiral and Sprial for Cursor.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's our fault too, we should have watched that.
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston, we'do have the pre- PDI AGS cal numbers, you won't need to read them to us.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, you don't want a recycle on this gravity measurement, I doubt if it will need it.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. No, no recycle necessary this time through.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, ED batts are 37.2.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, let me comment about the handling of the bird, after you once fly it around in orbit, you get accustomed to the thrusters, and it came back to me quite a bit from 10 anyway, and you get a feel for acceleration and deceleration as well as the attitude hold capability, and it really - the response, even with a heavy descent - descent stage near, it's phenomenal, it responded exactly in the direction I wanted, held attitude very good, and let me tell you the LLTV plays no small part in this landing as far as I'm concerned.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, NOUN 22 again, I'm going to torque them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 113 hours 44 minutes ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Some refined numbers on the landing site for Challenger: In degrees minutes and seconds, the latitude has been pinned down to 20 degrees 9 minutes 50.5 seconds north, longitude 30 degrees 46 minutes 19.3 seconds east, which is about 6 39 meters east of the designated landing point — the premission landing point. For those newsmen who have the landing site with the grid coordinates on it, that corresponds to DN.O by 84.2. At 113:45 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.

113:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 113 hours, 48 minutes ground elapsed time. We're estimating a change of shift, if you will Press Conference, with the landing team flight director, Gerry Griffin, in the small briefing room at 3:00 PM, To repeate estimated Press Conference in about 20 minutes, approximately, 18 minutes to be exact, in the small Briefing Room in Building 1. Some 42 minutes away from acquisition as the Command Module, America, comes around on revolution 14. Meanwhile on the surface, to repeat the estimated landing site. It is right down the line on the Ground Track. However some 369 meters east or short of the predesignated, premission landing point.
|CHALLENGER|A little better.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Looks good.
|CHALLENGER|Computer is now N 93.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Torque it.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. We're standing by -
|CHALLENGER|Okay Gordo, I'm ready to give aim in.
|CHALLENGER|Coming at you.
|CHALLENGER|MARK it, it's on the way.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, one other thing about the landing. I saw the light. I think, I heard Jack call it, - the contact light. I think I waited about a second and hit the stop-button she shut down immediately, and of course, you could feel the fall. I don't really feel we fell that much but it was quite a change in acceleration at that point.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Gene.
|CHALLENGER|And I guess I had, what I would guess a foot or 2 persecond forward on that one.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Sounds good.
|CHALLENGER|And, let me know when I can have the computer, please.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's your computer and I'm standing by with marking angles when you are ready to load them.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'll be ready in a second.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead with the angles.
|CAPCOM|Okay, these are the IMU parking angles. Plus 29586. I see you loading the radar. Do you just want to load these or write them down?
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead I'm writing.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Y will be plus all Os. And plus 08414. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Noun 20 will be plus 29586, plus all 0s, plus 08414.
|CAPCOM|That's correct.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston. I'm going to power down the AGS, if you're willing.
|CAPCOM|Not yet Jack, we'd like you to readout 04 7 and 053 to us.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. You want the new ones - - Okay, Gordy, if you're happy with NOUN 22, I'll enter them.

|CAPCOM|That's a good readback.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, the PLSS is against the hatch and we're installing the BRA.
|CAPCOM|Roger, on that.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. We've got 3 ques tions for you to help pin down your exact position, any time it's convenient, maybe when you're taking the out the window p i c tu re s . 0ve r.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo. I think we can give it to you, why don't you wait. We're just getting the (garble) bag out and jett bags out from behind the engine cover here, to give you an idea where we are.
|CAPCOM|Okay, no hurry at all.
|CHALLENGER|I had it pinned down for you until I got to about 500 feet when I changed my mind.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy. We're not going any further. We'll answer your questions here when we get some time. My best guess is 150 meters, from Poppy at one to two o'clock.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CHALLENGER|And, I'll bet on that one, but we'll get with you in a minute.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 150 northwest of Poppy.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah. Mostly west. But slightly north.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|I'll tell you the, we're abeam 1 think, just about abeam of Trident 1. I can see it out there, but I can't really define Trident 1 from Trident 2. And the thing that is a little different is that I appear to be closer to it than I normally would have expected to be.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|That's probably as close as the Navy Captain could ever guess where he is anyway.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston. We're just starting our eat-period. It's going to be a little behind, DRD readings are 170 37 and LMP is 24117.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 15:29 GET 114:36 MC-411/2
114:36:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We got that.
|CAPCOM|Would you verify your biomed right.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, that's verified. How does it look?
|CHALLENGER|Looks good.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy. We're starting to cut into a little lunch here and if you've got any questions, why don't you come up with them now.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We're wondering it you can — - wondering it you can give us estimate of the angular position, clock position of Rudolph. And can you line up Rudolph with a horizontal feature out beyond it.
|CAPCOM|I should say horizon feature - out in the distance, not horizontal.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. I thought Rudolph was right out there at 3 o'clock. Jack's looking at it and he said yes, that is Rudolph right at 3 o'clock out his right hand w indow.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|I don't know if it'll mean anything to you but, the shadow of the LM, the rendezvous radar antenna is pointing about 1/3 of the way down from the peak of Hadley. That I know pretty (garbled). And Gordo, 1 must be right here abeam of Trident 1. The only reason I hesitate is that I'm so close but, it's probably, well I guess it's close to 100 meters, 80 meters anyway, to where the rim of Trident 1 falls off. I am abeam of the center of Trident 1 and that's the only possible thing it could be. And that would put Poppy just about where I expected it to be.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|We just want to confirm. You're referring to Trident 1 as the eastern most part of Trident, is that right ?
|CHALLENGER|No, sir, Gordo. It's always been the western most part of Trident. The landing site was on a line between Trident 1 and Rudolph and judging from1: what Jack's got on his right hand window and what I've got on my left hand window we're right there, except possibly a scosh further south on that line.
|CAPCOM|Okay, understand.
|CHALLENGER|And it was right up where we all had expected it to be about half way between here and what we are calling the rim of Camelot. We can't see into Camelot we can just see the rim of it. It's several, oh, at least 200 meters, 2 to 300 meters up there I expect.
|CAPCOM|Okay, what o'clock position is the west, the nearest part of the rim of Cam - Camelot?
|CAPCOM|Or maybe if it's better defined, define the south rim. Can you see the south rim of it.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, Gordy, but it blends in so well, all we're seeing is a (garble) undulating high as the rim. And to the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 15:29 GET 114:36 MC-411/3
114:36:00|CHALLENGER|best of my knowledge we've got the south rim at, or crest of the east rim right at 12 o'clock Hey Gordy, right at 12 o'clock also is a boulder that's * at least three meters and maybe five and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you could find it. It's on a line between us at the intersection of the South Massif and the Family Moun - Mountain Horizon. Just slightly left of that line or south of that line. And that boulder ought to show up' on your best photography.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We'll take a look. One other question, -
|CHALLENGER|It's at least - That boulder's at least ZVl) meters away.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Can you see the west rim of Trident, and can you give us a clock position on the west rim of west Trident?
|CHALLENGER|The west rim of Trident, which by the way is full of out cropping looking boulders, is at 10 o clock.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene -
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I can look back around the corner now and I can - I - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 15:40 GET 114:47 412/1
114:47:00|SC|I can see where the east where Trident rose up to it's rim on the east side, and I would say we're abeam of a point - abeam of a point one third of the way from east to west up the center of Trident. That is, we covered one third of trike one and we're abeam of a point of a line that goes through the one third point from east to west of Trident one.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene that's very clear I think we've got you pretty well nailed down. And it's pretty close to the planned landing side.
|SC|Yes, I think it's very close to our planned landing site and 1 need to see where Poppy is because I think what I said earlier is true.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's all the questions now. Enjoy your dinner.
|SC|Houston, I have calmed down, but be advised that our dinner is corn chowder.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|He went to captains mast for eating that the other day.
|SC|Gordie Houston, 17. How do you read, or Challenger or whoever we are.
|CAPCOM|Whoever you are, you're loud and clear.
|SC|I took the binocs and looked at some large boulders at our 12 o'clock position. There probably on the order of a half meter to 2 meters buried but without strong filleting. And, both of them that I could see had the same mottled light gray and medium gray texture and looks like there is a lineation in it. And, whatever the mottling is it's on a frame size or fragment size of a - or a few centimeters and it looks as if it's very uniform in that mottling that Is there is one fragment size.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|There are a few - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 15:50 GET 114:57 413/1
114:57:00|SC|Have a quite of view. Near one crater out at 12:00. Dark gray rock that may be glass coated. Matter of fact one of them looks like it's right at the rim and might have been part of a projectile that made the crater.
|CAPCOM|Roger. The large boulder that I mentioned is several meters in diameter. Not even sure it's a boulder. It does have a well developed fillet. It's highly fractured. It looks like the fracture is generally north south, at least we can't see in on into the fracture. And it's to far away to be sure, but it looks like it's modeled also. Although there did appear in the binocular to be more heterogeneous modeling. It might be a breccia.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|That boulder ought to be very close to th e ALSEP site.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordo. In reference to these boulders, everywhere I can see out of my left window and out ahead of me in referring to that boulder Jack's talking about which is just a little bit on my side at 12:00, it appears that the dark mantle and some of this, and for the most part covered, has covered part of or is up on top of some of the crevices and the crannies and the boulders themselves with the exception of well, I'll take that back, even the very small ones. I'd say from a population point of view, boulders of the size Jack is talking about that are visible through the surface anywhere from one to two to three meters, a very small pe rcen tage ,b ut when you look at 'em that aren't level, it looks like they are quite populous. I'd say they're maybe about 25 of them in view between myself and the - where the horizon falls off down away from us down towards the South Massif. The area back towards Station 1 at least the other side of Trident, looks like it's more heavily strewn with some of these cylinder, the partially mantled large fragments .
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|To say that there is a boulder as such, actually sitting on the surface, I can't - I really can't find one. Unless they are more around something very small and possibly younger craters. And I think for the most part everything is somewhat mantled.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordy, I think maybe the predictions of a fairly thin regolith were good. Have a crater at about oh, 130 feet. It looks like it's not more than a meter deep. It's very fresh, has a bright halo around it and it's very rocky in it's interior. It has some rocks that are at least 10 or 20 centimeters in diameter on the rim. It looks like it's penetrated into some rocky - much rockier substrate than what we're seeing on the surface. The surface itself looks like a, oh, probably 50 percent fragments greater than half a centimeter.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 15:50 GET 114:57 413/2
114:57:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SC|I don't see any general si - I don't see any general size, Gordy. I do have a crater out here that is maybe a meter in diameter, that's fairly fresh, although not bright halo. That has not penetrated through blocky material. And it looks like that the saturation crater size is very small in the area we can see. That is there don't seem to be any old or very subdued craters, well, let me think about how to put that again. They're obviously saturated with craters a few centimeters in diameter but when you get b i 8 8 ® ^ than that there seems to be more of a clear distribution rather than a saturation.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordy, let me give you a quick far-horizon. 12:00 I've got Family Mountain. It's a - it and South Massif are a replica from there plate point where I am except that Family Mountain is much more symmetrical and rounds off to a verv more definite peak. The South Massif in turn, has got a high plateau a high flat peak on top. My far-horizon, then at 12:00 to 11:30 is dominated by Family Mountain. It's - well, I hate to use the word unorthosite without getting out of the spacecraft, but it sure is white. It sure is white, but it is varied shades of white. Ah, with sort of a, a tendency on its southern or southeastern slopes to be sort of marble caked with a darker material much the same color as the mantle we've landed on. The Family Mountain disappears just about at the level of the rim of Camelot on my far-horizon and just, it sort of, it starts out, let's say about 11:00. It just - just there's where the top of Massif starts up, very abruptly. I'd say, well, I'll try not to over estimate, but certainly 30 degrees I'd say. Very abruptly to a very impressive altitude. I know I was at 13 000 when I said I was at their level. That it sure looked it from there. It plateaus off from about 10:30 to about 9:30 and then it starts sloping back down t ow ard the east at about the same angle. Very s y mme t — rical. There are several places where you can see what appear to be outcrops. I'd say several - about a dozen anyway. Where you can see relatively large areas of outcrop on the South Massif. Th at outcrop is a — of a darker gray color than the white gray of the Massif itself. The one most domineered - dominent on top is right at the change in slope to the west where it goes up slope and then plateaus off and there is a definite outcrop. And you can see several boulders on all levels of the Massif that have come apparently from outcrops and I feel certain we will be able to get to some of those that have come all the way down. South Massif too is a -appears to be in areas marblely caked dirty, such as if they were sprinkled with a dirty or a darker covering and that covering is more evident as it slopes back here towards the east. As the far-horizon now, I can see South Massif all the way to 9:00 but then behind it there's just a little breadloaf-type dome of a much darker, much more hummocky mound back there, relatively big. It's probably, from where I stand, at least 10 percent the size of the Massif, the South Massif. Granite texture. There appear to be some lineations running, well as I look ---
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 16:03 GET 115:99 414/1
115:99:00|CHALLENGER|As I'm looking down at them their dipping down into the west at about 20 degrees, but that may be a sun angle problem. But, they are definitely there. And, then contrasting that is Bear Mountain which is also much darker gray much different than the massif where I stand much more hummocky surface appears to me to be what I would expect Sculptured Hills to be like. One other thing about the south massif is that as I look at - as I look at it at about 9:30 to 10:30 there is a little knob of the south massif that sort of flows toward the east or slightly toward the northeast that's the one that tends to be a little more heavily covered with the darker dusty material.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston, over.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're about 12 or 13 minutes behind the timeline for starting the cabin preps and back room is enjoying your description, but we think we'd rather you press on with preps and get ready to get out for a really good view, over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie we're doing this and eating too. We're trying to do them both at the same time, and we are pressing just want to say one other thing about the massif. I can see a couple of places where craters have penetrated very small craters and penetrated the massif craters maybe a meter or two in size some five meters and there is a lot of rock debris around them which tends to believe that there is very little if any soft covering on that massif.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Gordie, just a couple more words about the north massif. It looks like a good distribution of boulder tracks. Many of the boulders are accessible. They are -the tracks can be traced up at least to mid slope. That's at my 3 o'clock position, and occasionally at that midslope position particularly northwest of Henson, you can see abun-dent boulders suggestive outcrop. That's something that we had missed seeing on the premission photos. But — and it isn't as abundant as on the south massif, but there are apparent ledge formers about midslope.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, let's make it. I don't know if I want - let 51. (Garble) can throw away.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie there is also a few very bright sparks - sparkles from the surface - not abundant but a few .
|CHALLENGER|Let me - I need these.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston, I'm going to hand you over to the good Dr. Parker here, have a good trip outs i de th e re .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 16:03 GET 115:99 414/2
115:99:00|CHALLENGER|Gordie, thank you. You do outstanding work and we sure do appreciate it, babe.
|CAPCOM|My pleasure.

115:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 16 minutes. Mission Control at presently is using these coordinates as the landing point. We will continue to try to refine that landing point further. But, as of now, we're saying the landing point is 20 degrees 9 minutes 50 seconds north, 30 degrees 46 minutes 19 seconds east. This would correspond to — on the map, for those of you who have grid maps, DM 8 and 82.7. This —
|SC|Other than that, we just made a couple of suit adjustments.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|PAO|It's estimated that the lunar module, Challen ger, is on the planned north south line and approximately 1 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 18 minutes. We want to distinguish between the targeted landing point and the planned landing point. It had been the crew's intention all along to land approximately 200 meters east or short of the targeted landing point, the point at which the computer was targeting the Challenger. So, we believe that Challenger is approximately 300 meters east of the targeted landing point, which would put it about 100 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.

|CHALLENGER|Okay and I'm 3.8.
|CHALLENGER|Okay I'll give you a hack on it.
|PAO|Still about 20 minutes behind time.
|CHALLENGER|About 45 seconds.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'm one minute going back on.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston commander went from 3.8 to about 3.67.
|CHALLENGER|I'll get yours on when you need it on, Jack .
|CAPCOM|I copy that commander.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and we'll pick Jack up here in about 10 more seconds.
|CAPCOM|Copy.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Jack I'm turning on did you mark it?
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston 3.8 to 3.6. Houston did you copy the LMP?
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy the LMP. Okay and Challenger -
|CHALLENGER|Okay stand by for you're go to depress
|CAPCOM|- you'll be glad to know you are go for depres s.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 17:54 GET 117:00 433/1
117:00:00|CHALLENGER|Thank you, Robert, I understand we are GO for depress.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Jack, can you reach the front valve or do you want me1to.
|CHALLENGER|Well, let me turn around here.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, on 16, first around 16 cabin repress OPEN .
|CHALLENGER|Okay, 16, cabin repress OPEN. Circuit breaker is coming1open.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and cabin repress valve closed on the panel.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, the valve is closed.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. If you can't reach it, I guess I can .
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I just had a momentary tone.
|CHALLENGER|So did I. I got it too.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|I got it: when you closed the repress valve.
|CHALLENGER|Can you reach it? If not I'll reach the ove rh ead one.
|CHALLENGER|I think you better reach the overhead one .
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Slip over to your right.
|CHALLENGER|Some more.
|CHALLENGER|Let me turn here.
|CHALLENGER|Wait a minute, I get turned
|CHALLENGER|Okay, how far down are we going to take it?
|CHALLENGER|35, right?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, wait a minute.
|CHALLENGER|I'm not there yet.
|CHALLENGER|Well, I just want to make sure that I'm w a t ch i n g .
|CHALLENGER|Okay, now.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, coming open. You ready? You reading the checklist?
|CHALLENGER|Standby AUTO. (garbled) press is closed. Say when, okay, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Are you ready?
|CHALLENGER|Wait a minute, wait a minute. Got the wrong place.
|CHALLENGER|Open, then AUTO at 35. Okay, go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Here it comes.
|CHALLENGER|I can see daylight through It. Okay, it's coming down. Okay, that's

|CHALLENGER|Right here, huh?
|CHALLENGER|But that was -
|CHALLENGER|Check the cabin, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Do you read, Jack?
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston. CDR we're not reading the LMP either.
|CHALLENGER|Just a minute. Now how do you read?
|CAPCOM|We read you.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you're loud and clear, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|We got a switch in the wrong place as usual, Bob. Just hit the 0 select that's all.

|CHALLENGER|Okay. Starting to open the forward hatch when we can.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, can you step over to the left as much as you can.
|CHALLENGER|To the right, you mean.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, to the north. The north.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep* you bet you. I've come this far. I'm not going to miss getting a hatch open. Hey, something just flew out. It's open now.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Put just enough air in here, we're ... okay, it's open, babe1Okay, it is open.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay final prep, PLSS primary H20. I've got to figure out how1to open that now.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| train for this in1the right way.
|SCHMITT|Yes we'did. Okay, my water is open.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, I am too. Coming down.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|See 3 amps and I see EPS.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Water, excuse me, water SEP. Hell, the next thing it says that Gene gets out.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's what it says on my checklist.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I'm going to have to turn around a little and see if I can help you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes. I tell you at 4 and a half you're really pretty heavy.
|CERNAN| A piece of bread?1Would you believe that?
|SCHMITT|Yes, I'd believe it.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm beginning to I think. I still got a water flag. Not hot. Okay. Hell.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|How does the water pressures look, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, they're looking just a little bit low. We re still stuck with the buildup. It's going to take a little while.
|CERNAN| Okay, I'm getting down on my knees out here. How
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 117:04 CST 17:58 MC434/2
117:04:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're just fine. I'm bolding you away from the DEDA, the DSKY.
|CERNAN| I think. How does that look to you?
|SCHMITT|What?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I don't know. I can't see your legs.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think you're getting out though, because there's not as much of you1in here as there used to be. Oh, hey, Gene, when I get down there, I got to fix your tool harness. Hold it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's come off the bottom again.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I can't do it now, because it's come off from the bottom. I'll have to ...
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| open .
|SCHMITT|Can you squat down any further, because you're hooked on ..., you're making it worse.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, now I think I..., be careful because you might hook it on something down there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes. The back, It's loose on your back, on the back of the PLSS.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I'Ll fix it when I get out there.
|CERNAN| der is on the porch of Challenger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:02 GET 117:09 MC435/1
117:09:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy you, commander, and your feed water pressure Is looking much better now, and you're probably getting cooler.
|CERNAN| to you?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, and I'll have an ETB ready for you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Deploy MESA.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yea hey.
|CERNAN| lo oks 1 ik e .
|SCHMITT|Okay. I jettisoned — oh, you want an ETB?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep. You're the commander.
|CERNAN| like it started to stabilize at 38. I don't know whether I'm getting cooler or not, but I feel pretty good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that, too. Okay?
|CERNAN| be any problem. Over the strut. Okay, the jett bag is swringing free, swinging free.
|SCHMITT|You mean the ETB.
|CERNAN| s ack .
|SCHMITT|It is. Oh, boy. There it goes. The Rover looks in good shape.
|CERNAN| visors down. Jack, I wouldn't lower your gold visor until after you get on the porch because it's plenty dark out here.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|He's off.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Houston. The commander Is about three quarters of the way down.
|CERNAN| off at the surface at Taurus-Littrow, I'd like to dedicate the first step of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible. Jack, I1, out here. Oh, my golly. Unbelievable. Unbelievable, but is it bright in the Sun. Okay. We landed in a very shallow depression. That's why we've got a slight pitch up angle. Very shallow dinner-plate-like dish crater just about the width of a strut. How you doing, Jack?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:02 GET 117:09 MC435/2
117:09:00|SCHMITT|Fine. Getting the circuit breakers veri fied.
|CERNAN| boulder tracks1coming down. Can't exactly where we are. I think I may be just in front of Punk.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We copy that, Gene, and are the boulder tracks to both1the north and south?
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:07 GET 117:13 436/1
117:13:00|CERNAN| very obvious boulder tracks. A couple of large boulders come within 20 or 30 feet of the - looks like where we can get to 'em, but there's a couple - there's a couple I know we can get to. There the sun angle is such that what I saw on the South Massif earlier I can't see very well, but I know there were boulder tracks over there. The - Bear Mountain - boy, it's hard to look to the east. Bear Mountain and the Sculptured Hills have of a very, very sililar texture on the surface. Sculptured Hills is like the wrinkled skin of an old, old, 100 year old man is probably the best way I could put it. Very, very hummocky, but smoothly P0C marked. I do not see any boulders up by the Sculptured Hills from here. But it's awful hard to look to the east and southeast.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We copy that, Gene. Do you have an LMP with you yet?
|CERNAN| make sure. we'didn't have an awful lot of dust on landing; but I can dig my foot in 8 or 10 inches and I know we're at least that thick. There's a small little one meter crater right in front of us with a whole mess of glass right in the middle. That's right in front of the base as a matter of fact. Right where I want to park the Rover. Jack, you're looking good.
|CAPCOM|Beautiful, guys, beautiful.
|CERNAN| think this is Poppy, and I can give you a real better idea where we are. Hatches closed barely. Hey, Jack, don't lock i t .
|SCHMITT|I'm not going to lock it.
|CERNAN| and we're in trouble.
|CERNAN| place was smooth? Ah, boy. There's a lot of local depressions here I didn't figure existed.
|SCHMITT|Hey, whose been tracking up my lunar s urface?
|CERNAN| east of the LM and the back strut of the LM is - the left strut of this crater I talked about, and that's where we get the pitch angle, the best strut is probably down in the eastern one-third of that crater. Just a little - very subtle crater.
|SCHMITT|Hey, man, you had some forward velocity.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:07 GET 117:13 436/2
117:13:00|CERNAN| them. Awfully1lot of sparklies.
|SCHMITT|You landed in a crater.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to get to work in a minute just as1soon as I take a look at Trident.
|CERNAN| me deploy your1antenna.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|(laughs)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll be over there and you can fix my tool irons. I1don't like that thing loose.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What are you doing over there? We're supposed to be1working.
|CERNAN| All these little craters, Jack, have glass in the bottom of them. Here's another one.
|CERNAN| by the descent1boom out, oh, about 10 meters - no, 15 meters. Come over here1and I'll fix your antenna. Okay?
|SCHMITT|Hey, Bob, how big is Poppy supposed to be?
|CAPCOM|Standby. It looks---
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:11 GET 117:17 437/1
117:17:00|CAPCOM|It looks on the map -
|SCHMITT|I didn't hear you you cut out.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it looks on the map like it's about 75 meters in diameter. Fairly suttle.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I tell you what - I think I landed about a 100 meters from Poppy at 10 o'clock.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think so - I think -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I know I got to look around a little more. It sure is not Trident.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, a little more.
|CERNAN| on .
|SCHMITT|Okay the immediate surf - -
|CERNAN| to (garbled) up yet.
|SCHMITT|the surface is moderately cohesive which holds a pretty good boot print - very fine grain, Gene looks very much like previous soils you got it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You got to hold mine.
|CERNAN| Well you got me right in the Sun. Can you come around this way. (laughter) I'm going to have to get upstream of you.
|SCHMITT|Look you get up on the hill and I'll get in the hole.
|CERNAN| too fast. Boy your seat looks like you just walked on the Moon you know.
|SCHMITT|Well, I tell you Gene * I think the next generation ought to accept this as a challenge.
|SCHMITT|Let's see. them leave footsteps like these some day .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, what did you do with my tool harness?
|CERNAN| going to do. Oh, hold still.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Boy, I tell you looking to the east you might just well forget it.
|CERNAN| going to have to loosen it.
|SCHMITT|Well, if you could just stretch it around.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You can't huh?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Don't loosen it to the point where you can't get it back on.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:11 GET 117:17 437/2
117:17:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay.
|CERNAN| got the strap reversed for the velcro.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Gene, I think that will hold if it doesn't I'll fix you again.
|CERNAN| you can just look at it. See them all over? Very fine grain it's sparkly that's all. Bob, I'm going to midcooling or intermediate cooling.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Boy that sure - see the soil sparkle.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let's go back here and get to work and I'll show you that crater that's got nothing but glass in the bottom. That's a vesicular rock of some kind there, Geneo. It almost looks like (garbled) craters.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, I have to reiderate. Even the small even the very small the one and two inch three inch fragments that are laying around here have been dusted and filleted with the dark mantle. And that sweeping by the descent stage goes all the way out there Houston, where we were, which is about 50 meters I guess. Hey man - these rocks they almost have a pink - very light pinkish hue to them, and they are not -there are not obviously breccia now that's a breccia fracture there. But this stuff is something else again. I don't think there is any place you could land down here where you wouldn't have one foot in the crater.,
|CERNAN| (garble) of some kind about 10 or ISpercent vesicals I'm right in front of the LM.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 117:22 CST 18:16 MC438/1
117:22:00|SCHMITT|Say, quite a few of the rocks look of that type. Sort of a pinkish hue to them The texture is coarse, but I'm not sure how crystalline they are yet.
|CERNAN| ATV, check down there below it. Okay, let's take a look at the Rover.
|SCHMITT|Let's don't forget those.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's my fault, I guess.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| forward velocity. Look at that. Right there. About a foot slip on the pad.
|SCHMITT|I tell, you, there's craters all over here.
|CERNAN| wheel is where it's supposed to be. It looks good to me.
|SCHMITT|Our next little vehicle to work.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, sounds good Geno.
|CERNAN| LM, I could look right into an area and see the bell of the ascent stage. I never realized that before, but I guess that's normal h uh ?
|SCHMITT|Yes. We saw it on the pad. Remember.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Remember when we went out there.
|CERNAN| normal, and it doesn't look anything's missing, it's just right into the S un.
|CAPCOM|Yes. The consensus of opinion down here is that you can also.
|CERNAN| world to get a consensus of opinion from. Okay, Jack, it's about work time. I've got this Rover about ready to work.
|SCHMITT|I got a little delayed here.
|CERNAN| hard.
|SCHMITT|Okay, the MESA's up. Let me know when you're ready to deploy.
|CERNAN| thing I can see looks pretty good. The walking hinges, you will be glad to know, are intact. They did not drop.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's a first.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 117:22 CST 18:16 MC438/2
117:22:00|SCHMITT|You want me to go up there and do that, huh?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You ready for me to deploy?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Base of insulation is not coining off as easy as in training.
|CERNAN| Looking good to me. Yes, Jack. You can go on up. go on up. 
|SCHMITT|Okay.

|CHALLENGER|you're a beauty.
|SCHMITT|Well, let's see how good I am.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| toes.
|SCHMITT|You bet your life, I am.
|CERNAN| up there. Man, anything you grab, Jack, I just grabbed this lanyard that was in the dust, and it's really black.
|SCHMITT|You ready? Go.
|SCHMITT|She fell, Houston. She's open. Okay, you've got parallel chassis, the wheels look good on this side.
|CERNAN| done, let's get it1out.

|SCHMITT|You, you are right.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't know how much help I'm going to b e.
|CERNAN| It's coming. It's1coming baby. How's your wheels on that side? Can you see1them? Mine look good.
|SCHMITT|Wheels, they looked good a minute ago. I got the Sun so I1can't tell much —
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:21 GET 117:28 MC439/1
117:28:00|SCHMITT|Eeee. The only way to do it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, wait a minute. I'm coining down now. She's going to pop here.
|CERNAN| a Jim Irwin here.
|SCHMITT|Wait a minute. Watch out. Here she goes. Got her.
|CERNAN| out .
|CAPCOM|Roger, beautiful.
|CERNAN| to get off the hinge there.
|SCHMITT|Yep, yep. She's on, though.
|CERNAN| hinges. I wish you could see it. Jack, those wheels did not lock all the way up, though. We ought to pull them up before we wrap (garble) Well, there it goes. By itself.
|CERNAN| Let me pull it until the outriggers cables get slack.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that tape up there on the reel.
|CERNAN| reelin g.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| Okay, now I've got it.
|SCHMITT|I'd walk and fall into that crater if I went to the end of this line.
|CERNAN| oh, we're deploying it at an angle. Okay, the outrigger cables are f ree , Jack.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Got a different breed of rock up here. The stuff's sticking through this thin regolith -- or regolith, period. I don't know whether it's thin or thick yet.
|CERNAN| f ree .
|SCHMITT|Let me get this — let me get all this cable out of the way. Otherwise, I'll — is that enough of this stuff. I don't like all that over there. (Garble)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy, you certainly are changing the color of that cable, sir.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Did it work?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're getting dirty.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12711/72 CST 18:21 GET 117:28 MC439/2
117:28:00|CERNAN| touch the ground.
|SCHMITT|Just got to get some of this cable out of here.
|CERNAN| acceptable. Man, I'll tell you, I don't know how long this line to pull the Rover out is, but —
|SCHMITT|Well, I'll tell you, it sure is easy to get dusty, but that's nothing new to anybody.
|CERNAN| to say the surface was not formed yesterday. There is a regolith, it looks classic. Varied distribution of particles up to three or four centimeters anyway. Then, you start to get maybe a selective distribution of large fragments. Get that cable?
|SCHMITT|Yep. Hey, I'm going to walk away with this one.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. With four wheels on surface, okay. Let me -- let me pull.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Here's a couple of different looking rocks. One's very white, one's quite dark. But, we'do have a general rock type, I think, in the area of the big boulders. Jesus, how much cable is there?
|CERNAN| (Laughter) You're going to be a long way away. We're not there yet. Keep going. Okay, we've got the front wheels on the surface, but keep going, I don't think you've got it up there.
|SCHMITT|I never thought I'd do geology this way.
|CERNAN| it s1ack? I'll get up there and take a look.
|SCHMITT|Okay, it's slack.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's slack.
|CAPCOM|Wait till you get to the ALSEP package.
|CERNAN| (Laughte r)
|SCHMITT|I never knew that cable was that long, Bob. Ohhh, a glass bottom crater with a little bench. Looks like one of the Flagstaff explosion craters except for the glass in it. Right out at 12 o'clock. That's the one I was talking about, about having a bright halo. I don't know whether it's easier to walk out there or to do what I did in training that I wouldn't do on the Moon. Somebody's going to get tangled up with this thing.
|CERNAN| where. I'd -- what I'd — took me 5 minutes to do is get it all out of the way. Okay, Bob, the front wheels locked in. I had to pull the rear wheels back to get them to lock in.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:21 GET 117:28 MC439/3

|SCHMITT|Bob, you got any words on the yellow pins on the rear chasis.
|CAPCOM|Roger, the best way to put those in if you tried bouncing the chassis would be to push 'em with the contingency tool. I think it's what you are going to do.
|SCHMITT|that's firm. Did you get that Geno?
|SCHMITT|Need some help?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Did you fall down?
|CERNAN| here. We'll find out in a minute.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. we'll try to push it in.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|. Good.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Want me to get it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's a nice firm - I'll hold in on it. Almost. A little more. Wait a minute, Let me get it - let me get it right - okay, push.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Very good. Why don't you put that between the s eats ?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| got the post, better get the seat. Ahhhhh .
|SCHMITT|Ready. I'm going to take it a little slower here in a minute.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Just a little bit slower in a minute. The blush is off the rose.

|SCHMITT|No sir.
|CERNAN| I think we can do it.
|SCHMITT|Well, they were right down there unless you picked them up that's exactly where the Rover tool was, too, and I picked it up so they're probably there. I didn't see them though. Okay, I got my camera.

Drive power four is going to A. I didn't feel any earth shaking rumbles like I do in the trainer, but let's see what happens. Okay, Jack I'm going to find out in a minute. Okay - okay here we go. Okay, the front wheels turn. I can't see the rear ones.

|CAPCOM|That's a first.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, you're, wrong angle. Yes. They're turning. How does that grab you. They're turning.
|CAPCOM|How about that?
|SCHMITT|Come towards me baby. Looks like it's moving.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Keep moving. Don't run over me.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Man, if they don't like this. How's that. Let me move back, okay. How's the time line, Bob.
|CAPCOM|As far as I can tell, you guys are right on within a minute or two.
|SCHMITT|they're just a little high for me Geno.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm not sure I can get it without getting way away .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Somebody said it was going to be just behind the south fence.
|CERNAN| here, and I'll meet you at the front end.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| I start driving.
|SCHMITT|I know what that was over there I think. Let me see. Whee. Okay, Houston. The basic material around the LM is just what I said. A fine grain, medium gray regolith, appearing material that as the standard area population. The craters, though bigger than about a meter in diameter seem to get to rock fragments which I haven't yet learned how to pick up.
|CERNAN| position here. I think I know exactly where we are now.
|SCHMITT|Well, once you get them dirty, just like the boys say, it's hard to tell what they are.
|CERNAN| And we are from Barjea 12 o'clock, oh you can't see you're looking at the Sun, I guess about 150 meters due west of Barjea and that's why we look so close to Trident. I'm coming right up on Poppy. No question about where I am now. I've got Trident and when I get up there we are abeam of Trident 1, just where I said we were. I'm right at Poppy. We're about 100 meters, just about due west
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 117:47 CST 18:41 MC443/2
117:47:00|CERNAN| of course. But basically on that line, I think between Rudolph and Trident 1. And as I look at it the cross section about 100 meters north of Trident 1. That's the landing point.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 18:46 GET 117:53 444/1

|SCHMITT|You sure did. (laughs)
|SCHMITT|Where are you? Are you ready to go.
|CERNAN| Houston, did you get that position?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copied that, Geno.
|SCHMITT|And Bob, I'm very firm of that now, I'm almost positive, unless I'm awfully mistaken about Trident, I don't see how I could be from here.
|CERNAN| Houston, the basic bright colored rock type in the area looks very much like a crystobalite gabbros of the - I didn't see crystolalite but it looks like the gabbros in the Maria Basalt sweep. The coarse grained clinopyroxene plagioclase ro ck .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we have that.
|CERNAN| along side - am I gonna screw up that little crater with glass in it if I park there?
|SCHMITT|Right, we will eventually.
|CERNAN| park right here.
|SCHMITT|I'm sure we'll find some more.

|CAPCOM|Hey, we have a picture, 17, we have a picture.
|CERNAN| yours. I hope it moves now.
|CAPCOM|It does.
|CERNAN| hey, it moves, it's alive. You'll find out - hey, it moves, it's alive. Okay, Bob, I'm going to get SRC 1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, could we have a EMU check on you fellows when convenient?
|CERNAN| oh, I must be 80 per cent and no flags and no tones.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| let me see - 75, about 80 per cent and no flags, no tones. I've get 83 per cent.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that and you've sure got a lot of stuff on the Rover all ready.

|PAO|That was Jack Schmitt on the screen.
|CERNAN| SRC 1 is open, Gail1is in. Jack, watch these SRCs. I don't like the lock on this cable very well.
|SCHMITT|I never have.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 1910 CST 118:17 GET MC 449/1
118:17:00|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, you did get that.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Charlie as well.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we'did not copy your cup gage reading down here.
|CERNAN| cause I didn't give it to you. 3.9. No wonder that's so much work.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, copy that.
|CERNAN| wont stay in the base of her (garble) - okay, that will stay in there. Okay, Bob, it's closed. It sure doesn't seem like it wants to stay there, though - and the organic sample has been sealed.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Now we believe you're here - we see you in person.
|CERNAN| not stay closed - it just slowly springs up. There's nothing I can seem to do for it. I might be able to set something -a blanket - on top or something.
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by. We'll get back with you.
|CERNAN| open - I'm taking. I'm taking SCB 1 through Tool Gate. I'll get me a hammer and I'll give you a gravimeter reading.
|SCHMITT|No you won't. Not until you're done. I'll go get the flag there. Guess what? We're here again.
|PAO|Cernan has the red band around his arm.
|SCHMITT|the buddy sledge is on the Rover. Okay, ETB - Okay, CDR's camera - film magazine I had to work on a little bit to get it to work but its working.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|If I get that camera you can punch the gravimeter (garbled)
|CERNAN| a gravimeter reading. Is that all you need? 'Cause I'll go ge t th e flag.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you'd better let that - yeah, but why don't when you go - let me get some tongs, too. We need to salvage those. -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|- scissors.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me steady the Rover.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Don't go near the water. That reminds me of a good book. -
|SCHMITT|Ah ... boy ...
|SCHMITT|I can't go near the Rover.

|SCHMITT|I can't go near the Rover.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|How about you letting me stick these in your pocket with your -
|SCHMITT|Yeah -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm going to hang them here on the hook.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Right there.

118:21:00|SCHMITT|Okay, let me come over and help you. (Hum).
|PAO|The flag they're deploying is the flag that has been in the mission control center here during past missions.
|SCHMITT|(Garbled)
|CERNAN| though. That's no test.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's all right. Move right over here near your tire tracks.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's good. Right there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me give it a few whacks. Oh, balony. Okay. Watch your fingers. Now that wasn't too bad. Want to make sure it stands up. That's getting pretty - I can - well -we'll - we can prob - hum. (Laughter) Going as far as we can go (garbled) hit something solid for that one.

|SCHMITT|What? Pull that in.
|CERNAN| level. Tall guys are all alike.
|SCHMITT|Wait, I'm not through.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I will. I just can't start forward as fast as I would like to. Hate to touch it, my hands are so dirty.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it's going to want to curl. Maybe it'll it sort of looks like it's waving in the breeze.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|take a couple this way and we'll take a couple that way. How's that?
|CERNAN| let me get the Rover in the background.
|SCHMITT|(Garbled) well.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|I've got a beautiful picture of you guys up - down there.
|CERNAN| ful picture. You see that?
|CERNAN| Rover, but I guess it's a pretty good shot. How's that? Let me get the focus right.
|SCHMITT|I don't know where to put it.
|CERNAN| got you reaching for the flag. How's that?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 118:21 CST 19:15 MC 450/2
118:21:00|SCHMITT|that's very good, Gene. Let me get it to s t e re o .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's beautiful. It's got to be one of the most proud moments of my life, I guarantee you. Let you get a close in one and we'll trade cameras.
|CERNAN| aware of this, but this flag has flown in the MOCR since Apollo 11. And we very proudly deploy it on the Moon to stay for as long as it can in honor of all those people who have worked so hard to put us here and to put every other crew here and to make the country United States and mankind something different than it was.
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17 and presuming to speak in behalf of some of those that work on the MOCR we thank you very much.
|CERNAN| Right there.
|SCHMITT|(Garbled) I'll keep it down.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 118:26 CST 1920 MC 451/1

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What's that?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay. Let me get over here -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't - I don't think it's going - you're a little close, maybe. Get them both in focus.-
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Higher up a little -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me try it again, okay? I don't know, Geno-o, okay?1Let me get over here closer to you. Okay. That might have got it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17, the gravimeter's ready and a couple of words here. One, I presume you found the scissors, right ?
|SCHMITT|Yessir.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Two -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, and the main thing is we'do want the SRC closed and if you can possibly latch it - I'm not sure that's easily done -that would be one solution. The other would be to put something1on top of it to hold it closed.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Four of the brackets off the maze would be something or a rock that's nearby is another possibility.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Gene, what are you going to be up to n ow ?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|(garble) pallet?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, why don't I give the old inspection here bit, and1I really ought to have my camera, shouldn't I?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CAPCOM|Roger - that's affirmative.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 118:26 CST 1920 MC 451/2
118:26:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What would you just -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll take the old CDR*s camera. Not a bad camera to take.
|CERNAN| here and put it over - that'll hold it down.
|CAPCOM|I presume you're talking about the big bag, Gene .
|CERNAN| That's all it needs. It's just a little bit, just enough spring force in it. Okay, Houston, I think you've had all the good words about the LM. We have never flown a better LM. I guess that's safe enough to say. The quads look great, the old steera-bles were aimed right at you. Driver radar's in good shape in part - looks like parallel to Z. Just about perfectly. There's no visible - I'm on the 3 o'clock position plus Y. No visible contamination. There's a little bit of discoloration of the plume shield below the bustard. The engine bell never touched the ground. It's about, oh 15 centimeters off the ground.
|CAPCOM|How's that for coming down gentle?
|CERNAN| Jack .
|SCHMITT|Hey, we never heard what our landing para- me te rs were.
|CAPCOM|We'll worry about that later.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, but they always - they always give them to us in the simulator. Hey, Bob, judging from what I see on my clock, we're not but about 5 minutes behind.
|CAPCOM|That agrees more or less with the way we re ad it.
|SCHMITT|Gene had a little forward motion as I think you read his call, and that shows up in the forward foot pad at any rate, or did. It looks like he may have tail first a little bit. That's embedded to the full pad depth. I see no -oh, by george, Gene, you may have had a first. I think you stroked that thing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the rear - the rear landing gear.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll take a picture of it. May have stro -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 19:24 CST 118:31 GET MC-452/1
118:31:00|CERNAN| Mylar, is folded a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Roger. There's word floating around down here about a typical Navy landing, but I'm not sure whether we believe it or not.
|SCHMITT|He caught his tail hook. Say, Bob -
|CAPCOM|That's the best way.
|SCHMITT|- Just behind the LM in that very fresh crater I picked up an example of the kind of gabbro I was talking about and I'll stick it in the big bag - except the big bag has disappeared.
|CERNAN| if y o u ' re re ady .
|CAPCOM|Ready.
|SCHMITT|You put the big bag up -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I just put our sample in it. It's in the bottom bag. It's about 8 by 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters. Slightly tabular.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that from the big bag.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| done everything there is to do in the Navy, but deploying that Flag has got to be the most proud thing I'll ever do in my life. If you could see you and you could see it from where we are I know you'd feel the same way.
|CAPCOM|Roger on that.
|SCHMITT|Whew - (laughter)
|CERNAN| up there over the top Massif. Beautiful.
|SCHMITT|Hope nobody saw that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, they were watching me. (laughter) Those finks.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you weren't doing anything with this gravimeter on here, I hope.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. VAPC0M1Okay, you might grab me a (garble) when you set it on there, Jack.
|SCHMITT|too late, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I'll get it later.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'll get it later, no hurry.
|CERNAN| You've got to educate us again.
|SCHMITT|We may not remember those -

|CAPCOM|Copy that, roger.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. Here's a temperature for you. 40 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Say again.
|SCHMITT|40
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| over here - never did figure out what - Okay, Bob, the shade is deployed facing deep space.
|CAPCOM|Oh, copy. Roger. Understand the cosmic rays .
|CERNAN| not on the post yet, but it's deployed
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 19:30 GET 118:36 MC 453/1
118:36:00|CERNAN| deploy ed.
|SCHMITT|Oh, oh, come on, don't get, don't get all caught on something. That's better, that's better.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I think just about got a, the sun side deployed, just as perpendicular to the sun as I think anybody could do.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, good enough.
|CERNAN| so you might put that down as something to get later.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we'll cast that in the pan with the next EVA or something like that.
|SCHMITT|Man, if that - Boy, if that antenna doesn't get some noise from outer space, I don't know what will, if they are out there, and they are I'm sure, they'll see that one. That is even weirder looking out here than it is in the high bay. Hey, Bob, before we leave the ALSEP remind me to check the cosmic ray, I might hit it here in the process of deployment.
|CAPCOM|Okay, try not to.
|SCHMITT|I got a little close.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| b eauti fully.
|SCHMITT|I don't know what talent you have for landing in holes, Cernan, but once again I'll be doing all the ALSEP work in this hole.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Are you saying we should have kept the pulleys there, Jack?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I need the pulleys. Pulleys.
|CERNAN| of a problem here. I've got the set connector on (laughter) but it - it'll slide down in, but the locking cover just wont go over.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Geno, understand it slides in far enough, you think it's alined huh?
|CERNAN| doesn't appear to lock over, well not appear, it just won t lock over, I'm shoving it home. Okay, I got it, I got it, makes everyone happier.
|CAPCOM|I'm glad we have the right solution to that one, Jim.
|CERNAN| you've got a man here doing it.

|SCHMITT|Gene, I need your hammer.
|CERNAN| What's your problem?
|SCHMITT|Well, the dome removal tool never latched into the dome but it turned it. I think it's pretty badly chewed up. I'm not sure what happened. Let me have your hammer.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|So, let me have your hammer. I'm going to have to pry off the dome.

|SCHMITT|No, I, I, you see I stripped it, I think- (garble) I can do it.
|CERNAN| minute - let me -
|SCHMITT|See, it's stripped. See, but it's open - wait a minute - see, no wait - see. Just put your blade in there, don't touch it. Put the blade in there and pry. It'll come, I hope.

|SCHMITT|Nice work.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, once again we have the right solution. (garble)

|CAPCOM|Roger. It's not so shallow - you disppeared out of sight on the last one,
|SCHMITT|Well, it's shallow relative to other depressions I've been in. You know this ALSEP is almost as heavy as the one we had at the Cape. Uh oh. I lost one of my blocks. Oh well, I'll - I'll get it on a rock, or I'll retrace your steps.
|CERNAN| turn those rocks around and use it.

|CERNAN| rail is cracked off and I'm just going to put a couple of pieces of good old fashioned American gray tape on it - see whether we can1 t make sure it stays. Because I don't want to loose it. Lxcept good old fashioned gray tape dosen't want to stick very well.
|SCHMITT|I've not seen any sign of layering in any of the craters - in their walls.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|the rocks still seem to be pinkish gray - a pinkish gray gabbro out here.
|PAO|Gene Cernan taping the fender on.
|CERNAN| stick to lunar dust covered fenders. One more try. I think it'll stay for an indefinate period of time right now. Not bad for EV gloves .
|SCHMITT|Can you see me Bob?
|CAPCOM|No, we're watching Gene right now. You disappeared out1of sight a long while ago.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 19:52 GET 118:59 MC 458/1
118:59:00|CAPCOM|Hey, you just came into sight again, Jack.
|CERNAN| the heat flow.
|SCHMITT|I'm going to, I'm looking for a place, away from ere ate rs and rocks.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I think I've got a place and I think it will also give you a spot for the neutron flux that's sheltered from the RTG.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you say you have a place like th at, J ack ?
|SCHMITT|Well, I - pretty much, I think, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Let me work on it here a little more.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and right now you're about 10 minutes behind the time line, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| minute or two on the fender.
|SCHMITT|Okay, chuck.
|CERNAN| this .
|SCHMITT|Boy, I'll tell you, Geno, I tell you, I'm going to go back this way. Central station can be near a crater, it will be pretty good, that'll put the LEAM right out over there, which is probably all right. The perimeter out over which is probably all right. Kind of puts your drill holes a little to close to that rock, though. Bob, ask Mark if he's worried about rocks as much as craters.
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by.
|SCHMITT|We've got a rock about 2 meters in diameter, partially buried, that one of the probes may be near.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. Define near.
|SCHMITT|Well, it could be 10 feet.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Well, I can move a little more south I guess.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, it seems like, you're about 3 meters from the rock, that's no problem.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 19:52 GET 118:59 MC 458/2
118:59:00|SCHMITT|Okay, okay, this is it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|I tell you the block - the - let's see the sun's south, this way, south of east, okay, ah shoot.
|CAPCOM|What's wrong.
|SCHMITT|Well, it's just about impossible - Bob, it looks like the probes are going to be in a shallow depression. I'll try to imp rove that a little. It's not a real crater, it's just a shallow depression.
|CAPCOM|Stand by, stand by on that, Jack, a minute, that may be okay. Okay, sshallow depression's all right, Jack, don't worry about it.
|SCHMITT|It's not more than a meter deep.
|CAPCOM|That's okay, Jack. Stay there.
|SCHMITT|All righty, it looks pretty good to me.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good enough.
|SCHMITT|Just - Bob, it's really in detail. The meter and naif meter scale we read is a little more than we can stand here for a good site, but I think, I think this will be all right.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. We're ready to press on with ALSEP interconnect. And Geno, how are you doing on that fender.
|CERNAN| on I'm going to take a picture of it 'cause I'd like some sort of mending award, it's not unique but tape and lunar dust just don't hang in there together.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| crossed and I'll be more careful around the fenders.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| thing real quick here. I've got to dust my visor off.
|SCHMITT|Gene, do you want me to do that?
|CERNAN| here, only have to do it in a couple of places right in front of me. That didn't do much good, did it. Someone should have told me that. That just really screwed it up. Okay, Bob, you might ought to be thinking of a good way to clean that visor when I get in the cabin.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll put someone on that.
|CERNAN| Blankets are open one hundred percent. TV sun shade is on, set receiver antenna nav cable. We've got 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the charges. TGE. I've got premeasure on complete, I've got the drill, the bag and the nutron flux, the TV camera, I'm taking it away from you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Roger.
|CERNAN| switches going to 1.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 19:52 GET 118:59 MC 458/3
118:59:00|PAO|We'll loose the picture while Gene Cernan drives the Rover out to the ALSEP site. Get a picture back very shortly after he's parked the Rover.
|CAPCOM|(garble) reading, those are a little high and we'd like to try and clarify some of that stuff.
|SCHMITT|Boy oh boy, yeah, I get you, Bob. Boy oh boy, you just got to be careful where you (garble) boy, don't do that again.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:06 CST 2000 MC 459/i
119:06:00|SCHMITT|Yeah, Bob, I thought they were a little high, too.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Okay, about temp. 100 and 120 - right now.
|CAPCOM|How about tapping the meter a little bit for us. Jack, how about tapping the meter a little bit for us.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I think the meter's been tapped since we've been working on the Rover. Yeah, 100 and 120.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Get this baby started.
|PAO|We're 2 hours and 5 minutes into this EVA.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene-o, we'd like to vary the Parking a little bit because of this. We'd like to try and get those batteries cooled down because of this. You can park about 50 feet north of the Central station. And facing east down sun that will open the battery covers,
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Well, approximately there.
|CERNAN| h e re .
|CAPCOM|Facing —
|CERNAN| I got it, wait a minute.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Gene-o, we mean up Sun. Sorry about th at.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Boy, it doesn't take much to get those battery covers dirty,
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, did you copy that we meant facing up sun?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What did you do, get (garble)? Okay. I got that.
|CERNAN| to th e ri gh t .
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Did you copy that?
|CERNAN| would you?
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like you to park facing the sun. How's that for being definite. CE RN AN1Okay .
|CAPCOM|About 60 feet north of the central station.
|CERNAN| park a little northeast? Now okay, you want the battery covers
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:06 CST 2000 MC 459/2 open ?
119:06:00|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Gene. And that means you will have to dust them before you open them.
|CERNAN| land up here, Jack.
|SCHMITT|So am I.
|CERNAN| Is that where you're going to have the central station, huh?
|SCHMITT|Well, Gene-o, that's the best I can do but I've spent a lot more time,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And let me talk to you about it. And ask about this depression.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Your probe's alright out in here and if you get in the bottom of it for the - either this one or go out there -especially in the straight line between you and me now, another de-pression would be good for the neutron flux. You need to be over that way - you're just a -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You need to be over here. First central station, right there, huh? You need to -
|CERNAN| batte ries.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, for your planning -
|SCHMITT|Okay, about 60 feet northeast. How does it look behind you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, L7, to your planning - you're about 20 minutes behind the time line -
|SCHMITT|that's good, Gene. That's good.
|CAPCOM|We're now about at the timeline.
|CERNAN| to wait.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're about 20 minutes behind the timeline, 2 zero minutes.
|CERNAN| sidering a couple of things. Okay, about time I got those batteries. Okay, Jack, let me give you this first, so I can get to wo rk.
|SCHMITT|Oh, the block.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm sorry, I forgot you had it. Thank you.
|CERNAN| is off, let me doublecheck that while I was thinking of something. I wouldn't want this Rover to go rolling over the terrain without me. Okay, it is off. On switch position 3, dust CTV and the whole works, huh? There is TV remote. Okay, Bob, you're alined on the high gain.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. We copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Good (garble).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:06 CST 2000 MC 459/3
119:06:00|CERNAN| hard to get at the covers as one might think.
|PAO|We've got a black and white picture now.
|SCHMITT|I'm working on the link connection now, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that, Jack. I copy that, Jack. Understand you1-
|SCHMITT|Say, it's hard to hit that garbage pile.
|CAPCOM|Understand - Roger, understand you almost have the heat flow connector connected by now?
|SCHMITT|Yessir.
|CERNAN| battery covers1open.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got the heat flow for you.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 20:09 GET 119:15 MC460/1
119:15:00|SCHMITT|Well, the old LEAM connector doesn't connect, just like usual, or lock.
|CERNAN| batteries, the covers are clean and the batteries themselves are clean, the LR - LCRU has been dusted and so has -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|LEAM's locked on.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| the shade.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Geno.
|CERNAN| that helps. Whee, I gonna go to max for a minute here, do you buy that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, we copy.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| to intermediate.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I'm ready to go to work.
|CAPCOM|Good.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to push the gravime ter,
|CAPCOM|Roger, mark.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you have a mark, you're thinking and remember what I said, it's a piece of cake to take on an d off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| Okay, I'll pull a load heat flow 10 30 west, we've got the connector connected. Third heat flow 30, place on ground experiment up, okay. We'll do that, Jack. Keep your eye on cables. Oh man, all I can do is go down hill over here. Jack, you read.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm just trying to level.
|CERNAN| SCHIMTT1No, I'm just, I'll be working with it to try to level it. That's going to be a major task.
|CERNAN| I'll get this thing squared away when I carry Boyd Bolt time.
|PAO|Jack Schmitt working with the lunar surface gravimeter.
|SCHMITT|Ha, whee, that really went.
|SCHMITT|Man, these things are just like they are at the Cape. You feel every one of them.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by, I'll find out.
|SCHMITT|Oh, oh.
|CAPCOM|Watch it, Jack.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 20:09 GET 119:15 MC 460/2
119:15:00|SCHMITT|First cable, first cable hooked.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep, I'll straighten it up in a minute.
|SCHMITT|Okay, the LSG is going out.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Jack.
|SCHMITT|I hope it does the things that we want it to for us.
|PAO|This is the experiment.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I'm not doing to badly on keeping things clean. The base at the central station and got some stuff on it, but otherwise pretty good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we appreciate your efforts and we understand you got the LEAM connected eventually.
|SCHMITT|Yes, and it locked, just took some dealings. Okay, sun's over there. Oops, I forgot my Boyd Bolts, let 1 s s ee.
|CERNAN| not a can.
|SCHMITT|Boyd Bolts are off. Bob, does it bother you that the base of the LSG is touching soil? This is pretty soft. Bob, did you give me an answer?
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron thinks he has seen it. We haven't had a confirmation on the last orbit when you were talking to him, but he thinks he saw it the previous orbit.
|SCHMITT|Hey, hey, Bob, can the LSG, the base of the LSG, be touching the soil.
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that. Roger, Jack, the -
|SCHMITT|Well, it's very soft and it's going to be very hard to level for it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, the base can be touching the ground.
|SCHMITT|Okay, it's level. Alined, the sun shield is shaded inside. The level bubble is just touching the outer circle, a one circle, and I'm through with that, it's perfectly centered now and I'm going to uncage. Whoops, the experiment moved. It's still pretty good level. Okay, it's uncaged, the gimbal is swinging.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|the gimbal is swinging.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, and Jack, you're still -
|SCHMITT|Bubble is back just touch - yeah, I know, I've been working man.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I went to pseudo intermediate between minimum and intermediate. The bubble is just touching the - it's circle and the alignment, center alignment is good.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that. Thank you.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Gene, you've got some good slack here, if you can leave it that way. You shouldn't have the cables draped across anything, that's good.
|CERNAN| in there. It won't there it is.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:24 CST 2017 MC 461/1
119:24:00|SCHMITT|Can I help you, Gene?
|CERNAN| though. I'm not sure I - Bob, I got a little dust on the white surface, not on the mirror of the heat flow. Have you got any recommendations?
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that Jack - or Gene. Is that on on the heat reflector?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, as long as not on the mirror it's okay, Gene .
|CERNAN| double check.
|SCHMITT|Watch it, you're pulling pretty hard.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're pulling -
|CERNAN| mirror's clean.
|CAPCOM|Okay, then it's good enough.
|SCHMITT|Give me some more slack up here, you're (garble).
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| the re.
|SCHMITT|Okay, okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's good.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|this way just a little, Gene-o. That's good. Doesn't take much.
|CERNAN| out here. There's enough soil here to level almost anything.
|SCHMITT|But that's so soft, though, it's hard to get a fast level. Whoops. That's strange. I think I did something wrong.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Pulled the pin at the wrong time - (garble)
|CERNAN| good, and Bob, I verified that that dirt is not on the mirror. It's on the white stuff that - that, you know, is horizontal to the surface of the box.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene, that's okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, thank you.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're ready.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:24 CST 2017 MC 461/2
119:24:00|CAPCOM|Roger, the camera's been running all this time,
|CERNAN| will go down to a hundred and maybe a scooch under 120, so maybe those batteries are cooling off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good.
|CERNAN| that 3rd EVA.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN| Okay, pull pin two. Pin two always comes after pull pin one.
|SCHMITT|I think that's in the NASA documents now.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Pin two comes before pin one.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Drill three comes before drill one and two, also. I think I overdid that one.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, it went clean out of sight but by all means, watch drill two.
|CERNAN| clever. Boy, you think you're so clever. Believe it or not, Bob, I'm anchoring the geophone module.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, it looks to us on the TV as though you're anchoring the geophone module with a flag.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's what I'm doing. I'm anchoring the geophone module with a flag. Okay, one leg. Two legs. Three legs. And none of them - none of them -
|CERNAN| pile .
|CAPCOM|Alright.
|CERNAN| like every other ALSEP deployment - it's hard to control.
|CAPCOM|And I understand all your legs came out okay, Gene-o, or didn't come out.
|CERNAN| ring is pulled.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Amazing. Amazing.
|PAO|Jack Schmitt working with the lunar surface profiling experiment.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I've got my tools of the trade right here. I'm ready to go to work. Now, I put a mark in the deck - here it is, right there.
|CERNAN| won't rot ate.
|CAPCOM|Try rotating the UHT.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, remember that one?
|CERNAN| I knew it would happen. Where's your garbage pile, Jack?
|SCHMITT|Well, I can't find yours.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:24 CST 2017 MC 461/3
119:24:00|CERNAN| ALSEP.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I made a mark over here that says that should be about cable length.
|CERNAN| you're awfully close.
|CERNAN| Right here .
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, that's alright. No, this will be al right. I just want to keep away from you there. We shall soon see how tuned we are. I'm anxious to see under this mantle.
|CAPCOM|So are we.
|SCHMITT|Well, Bob, I hope I drill you a couple of good holes.
|CAPCOM|How about three?
|SCHMITT|And I know you do, too.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, the arrow is east/west, pointing west, the bubble is in the center. If I'm lucky, it'll stay there. I'm not - I'm more like east/northeast. I'm trying to keep a little further away from Gene.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Breakseal is open - okay, that was my mark. Let me see. Doublecheck that cable length. I'd sure hate to drill a hole that was outside the length of the cable. Okay, the LMS is deployed, I'm policing the site. The screen is over the port -
|CAPCOM|I'll copy that.
|SCHMITT|I'm gonna move one big rock -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:33 CST 20:27 MC 462/1
119:33:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What were you doing down in there? (Laughter)
|CERNAN| adhering to the sides of the LMS, And a few particles less than half a percent of the surface on the top, but of course you're going to clean that one off, so that's all right.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CERNAN| cent dust cover.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. And Geno, you're leaning pretty heavy forward on that drill.
|CERNAN| she hit a pretty dead stop and then I hit some rocks here. I'll watch it - I won't lean forward. I'm not putting too much pressure on it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| through rock. Maybe just a little longer drilling hole than it was at the Cape.
|PAO|Cernan drilling two 8 foot holes for the heatflow experiment.
|CERNAN| bit of resistance.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're observing that, Geno.
|CERNAN| she breaks through a soft spot.
|CAPCOM|Good.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I'll tell you this central station's a bear - bear to get level. Yeah, I just got dust on it now. It's j ust too so ft .
|CERNAN| cause it took a lot to get it off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and we could certainly stand a little bit of dust at least on top of that central station sunshield.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I guess the level's important.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|I can just see what John's thinking right now. That's what makes the difference. That's where you expend your energy.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I don't know that I'm going to be able to do that without a lot of time. It's hanging against the south edge.
|CAPCOM|Say again there, Jack.
|SCHMITT|I don't know whether I'm going to be able to level it - the central station.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:33 CST 20:27 MC 462/2
119:33:00|SCHMITT|Okay, I got It off the edge.
|CAPCOM|Okay, then we better just leave It there.
|SCHMITT|Ah, Well, I'm making it worse by getting dust on the top.
|CAPCOM|No, the dust on the top is not as important as getting it leveled, Jack, but if you get it broken off the edge that ought to be good enough.
|CERNAN| I guess about 80 - well now there's half. I guess 60 percent no flag and no tongs.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Geno.
|CERNAN| the gnomon is alined and I'm going to leave it alone.
|CAPCOM|Roger on that.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I think I lost all the time I might h ave made up.
|CERNAN| some pretty stuff - pretty tough stuff. Consolidated material, like rock fragments and then it breaks through and then it jumps for about 3 or 4 inches and then I hit some more fragments.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're seeing that Geno. Looks inter esting.
|SCHMITT|Oh, me. I got too low on that one. I thought I had that gaged.
|CERNAN| out of sight .
|CERNAN| breaking this drill from that - those boards without that tool. I guarantee you that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that, Geno.
|CERNAN| With a little help. Okay, number 3 coming up.
|CAPCOM|Roger, the third and last one on this hole.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Don't work too hard.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 2036 CST 119:43 GET MC 463/1
119:43:00|CERNAN| sprinkle the whole area with water and get rid of some of this dus t -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. Can you remember that those heat flow cables are not crossed as they come out of their box?
|CERNAN| of them - not crossing them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, very good.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Good.
|SCHMITT|Oh, ho, ho, ho. Where do we find such men?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, slow. This leveling is really throwing me behind the power curve, but I know they're serious about it, so -if I can keep it like it is now I am in like Flynn. Its perfectly centered. Even the gnomon is aligned within a shadow width.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Really working down there, are you?
|CERNAN| down there now. Whew. -
|SCHMITT|What bore are you in?
|CERNAN| and it kept running - if that drill kept running and I wasn't anchored to the ground it would throw me over the massif (chuckle). In tangential turns.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Gene, if its getting really tough and you're not making much progress we'll be happy with it where it is.
|CERNAN| where its suppose to be and that's where -
|CAPCOM|You were hiding it from us, we couldn't tell how deep in you were.
|CERNAN| all the way and they're both going to work.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| picked that word up but (chuckle) its better than some. - I guess. Now, if I can use my little lean-to here. Aw, man, that works great. That works great. Put this out of the way. Bob, I'm into the white mark, it depends on what you want to call the surface - you know its - I can give you - give or take 6 or 8 in ch es .
|CAPCOM|Yeah, something like that will do, Gene, I guess. You can measure it -
|SCHMITT|Gene, is the dust coming up changing color on you at all?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 2036 CST 119:43 GET MC 463/2
119:43:00|CERNAN| can't even tell where its coming up.
|SCHMITT|Oh, ho ho.
|CERNAN| just pushing it aside.
|SCHMITT|Boy, I'm telling you'll like that central s tation.
|CAPCOM|I saw something come up just then, Jack.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, on that -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Pretty amazing.
|SCHMITT|Okay, when I - I finally leveled it in a bull's eye. I don't know whether you heard me or not but it was - it was perfect. So its okay. Its just got a fair - its got about 20 percent dust cover on the top of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Say, Jack, ALSEP says that that's okay - that's no problem.
|SCHMITT|Okay. I put a rock under the northwest corner. Oops - guess what happened? Just like in training, Geno.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the old geophone cable caught on the corner.
|CERNAN| on that, that's an airplane.
|SCHMITT|Houston, there's no dust on the probe except that which was on my hands.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| more talkative but this is taking all the concentration I've got. I'll have to push this down, I can see that. Yeah, this (garbled) doesn't hold any better here than it did in training.
|CERNAN| don't lose that. Notice how you talk to yourself out here?
|SCHMITT|Who, me? (chuckle)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're getting farther and farther behind.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're one what?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, did you fall?
|CERNAN| an equal opposite reaction, isn't it?
|SCHMITT|Hey, I've heard that before. - Okay, secure thermal curtains - thermal curtains are secured.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're showing, Gene, just about 20 minutes and Jack's just about 25 - between 20 and 25 minutes for both of you.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 2036CST 119:43 GET MC/463/3 
119:43:00|CAPCOM|I'll check that.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:51 CST 20:45 MC 464/1
119:51:00|CERNAN| PAPA 1 and it hooked.
|CAPCOM|How about that.
|CERNAN| these -
|SCHMITT|take it easy.
|CERNAN| believe F-l?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I believe you, Gene.
|CERNAN| you that's about an inch below the white spots or Bravo 1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy, Bravo 1.
|CERNAN| last thermal shield on now.
|PAO|Jack Schmitt working on the ALSEP central station alining the antennas it looks like.
|CERNAN| to the south but I don't expect it'll stay that way unless I put some dirt over the cable. How does that grab you?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, Gene.
|CERNAN| Okay, that's coming out south. That's in good shape. I'm pleased with that.
|CAPCOM|Dirt's okay if you want to put it on -
|SCHMITT|(Garbled) I'm moving out.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| them all on there.
|CAPCOM|(Garbled) Did you want to put some dirt on there to hold it down, that's okay.
|CERNAN| di r t.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Good enough.
|CERNAN| make life easier out here.
|SCHMITT|Stay away from the cable.
|CERNAN| e ither.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that.
|CERNAN| walked - just to the north - not the mound the depression that's just to the north of me?
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17 (garbled).
|CERNAN| that one for the core?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|Geno, can you give us distance estimate to that? Does it look like it's 80 feet or so?
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:51 CST 20:45 MC 464/2
119:51:00|CAPCOM|Okay, then that sounds good.
|SCHMITT|Oh, shucks. Hey, Bob, is there any way a level bubble can fail? (Laughter)
|CAPCOM|Jack, remember that's on top of wobbly legs and wobbly springs there and would be thing not being straight. You shouldn't really expect the level bubble to be level after the things been deployed. That happened at the Cape a couple of times remember?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, but Bob I've - I've moved this practically all the way down the full throw and it's - that bubble won't move and I can't get it to move by tilting it and I was level. And the bubble on the top of the central station is still level.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're talking about the level on your other one, huh? Stand by on that.
|SCHMITT|It's over (garbled). Both of them - I can't get it to move to the other side of the fluid.
|SCHMITT|Keep working. That thing shouldn't fail. I've gone full throw that's not level. That bubble's stuck in there, somehow. In both of them. That's not even pointing close to the Earth. Okay, I'm going to have to tweak it up and let them see the signal strength tweak it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, why don't you try and manually point it try and level it and see what you can do toward getting it towards th e E arth .
|SCHMITT|I will, Bob. That bubble's just not working. I can't figure that one out.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just go ahead and -
|SCHMITT|Okay, maybe I jarred it loose here.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I think I jarred it loose.
|CAPCOM|That's another first. Okay. We won't.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got another one loose. That's very strange. A sticky level bubble. Ha Ha. Never heard of it. Hey , B ob.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack.
|CERNAN| about is this depression - is this depression in here for the core, oh, maybe 15 or 20 meters out here, Jack, what did you have in mind for the neutron flux?
|SCHMITT|Either the one you're in - you're down in there, or the next one over behind that rock in front of you over there.
|CERNAN| far probably.
|SCHMITT|Either way I think is fine, Gene. But I would suggest behind the rock for a neutron flux, (garbled) and the core.
|CERNAN| in that depression.
|SCHMITT|Well, that - there's also one over there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 119:51 CST 20:45 MC 464/3
119:51:00|CAPCOM|Okay, and 17.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|17, 17 we think you guys are by far the best position to judge that, far better than we are. You know what the requirements are on shielding and greater than 50 meters -25 mete rs.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene. Looks like that one went in fairly well.
|CERNAN| Not too bad.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Oh, I must be getting old.
|CERNAN| harde r.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I'm not very happy with this level., but I'll turn it on - after we come back a little bit later, when they've warmed up some more and let's see what it looks like.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll do that. Give me a mark when you turn it on and we'll see what kind of signals we get.
|SCHMITT|Okay, the shadow gnomon is aligned and we're turning the shorting plug on.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|It's on .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|And -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 120:01 CST 2054 MC 465/1
120:01:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What's your problem?
|CERNAN| it's so loose. You know those threads sometimes stick on you a little bit. I got one stuck halfway down and the bore is turning so now I've got to use a wrench on it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and we have two -
|SCHMITT|Bob, I've got a rock about ten feet south east of my LEAMS location. I could move - I could move a little more north and get a look at 15 feet from that. That okay?
|CAPCOM|How big is the rock there, Jack?
|SCHMITT|Oh, it stands - it's a meter wide and stands about a third of a meter high.
|CAPCOM|About a third and about a foot high.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|A third of a meter.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| the first bore right on up trying to get this thing on right.
|CAPCOM|Now put it in - put it in before the hole fills up there, Gene-o.
|CERNAN| this second bore on. Now, let's see if I can get it back in. Well, not quite as far, but high enough for me to reach the -it still feels - Bob, like there's a lot of fragmental material down there.
|CAPCOM|I'll copy that, Gene. Good luck.
|CERNAN| I got the bore on right, anyway.
|SCHMITT|Well, shoot.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, as long as it's only 1 foot high and 10 feet away, that will be satisfactory.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay, Bob, the lead's deployed, the line and the level bubble is just touching the inner ring.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| yet ?
|CAPCOM|Watch that cable, Jack. Roger. Started to tell you that when you had the question there. We're getting a good lockup on the data.
|CERNAN| happy with the level.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll get back with you on that.

120:01:00|SCHMITT|there you go again.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I've sure been having trouble with UHTs today. They just1don't want to lock in when you get dust in them.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It was what?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds good to me.
|CERNAN| dark out, is it?1Guess not.
|SCHMITT|Hope not or we is in trouble.
|SCHMITT|I think maybe I went the wrong way. I did. I went to rain instead of max. Here it comes. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Man, what did?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Huh.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Coming out a little hard. Wouldn't you know it ?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|No, Gene-o, we'don't have the heatflow turned on yet.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think that's right.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, just like I thought. Antenna doesn't want to go in.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 21:03 GET 120:09 MC 466/1
120:09:00|CAPCOM|Is that the number 3 section there, Gene?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, beautiful.
|CERNAN| guess we'll find out when I put the probe in. I think they're all in there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm about ready to deploy some ge ophone s.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, did you get the antenna into that sub pallet okay, eventually?1.
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CAPCOM|Good enough.
|CERNAN| it spits the whole drill back at me. Knock it back about a half inch or so and then it will bite through it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| an awful lot of fragments I'm busting up down there.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| came into something hard, but it's down all the way.
|CAPCOM|Beautiful, Geno.
|SCHMITT|Oops, there's a heat flow probe.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I - I messed up -
|CERNAN| failure after all that drilling.
|SCHMITT|No, I just walked to close to it, I apologize for that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll mark that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll do that, (garble)
|CERNAN| kind of heart rate has this drill been producing on me?

|CERNAN| you another one here. While it's duty I'll tell you I'm in to the bottom of the white mark and that's - oh, about b ravo 1 again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy, Papa 1, Foxtrot 1 and Bravo 1.
|CERNAN| to the top of the white mark, I'm still putting the probe down .
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.

|CAPCOM|How about papa 1, Geno.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Rog, I think Mark won that one.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. And, Jack, I gather you are probably trapsing across the landscape with a geophone about now, right?
|SCHMITT|that's afirm.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and let me ask you -
|SCHMITT|Good gravy, you know this rock -
|CAPCOM|Stand by. Go ahead.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I gather - you said that the HFE ELEC was leveled and alined and I gather that meant it was on the black decal on top, do you happen to remember what a number was on that?
|SCHMITT|Well, I'll check it, but I don't think you know where that decal is.

|SCHMITT|You might.
|CAPCOM|One never knows, Geno.
|CERNAN| I'll save it until after I drill the core. Oh, me or my ...
|SCHMITT|take it easy, Geno. You sound like you're -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| those visors down, I suppose - those other visors. Okay, let me take a look at my list and see whether I've got everything. Measured measured high tide - you've got all those shields, you're coming out south - verify heat flow is level and aligned -it is aligned and gnomon was good, UHT to the LRV LMPC and then what do I do - let me see. deep core prep - Jack, I'm going to leave the UHT and get me the heat flow in case you need it.

|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|and LMP is - LMP is 5 6 percent.

|SCHMITT|that's good. Oh, man, go slow.
|PAO|We're at 3 hours 21 minutes into this EVA.
|SCHMITT|Bob, all of these big boulders around here that I've looked at are the same rock type. Oh - who pulled all the geophone module.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, that sounds like the title of a book.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What happened?
|CERNAN| I took number one in the right direction. Yep. Okay, number 4 will be a little hard to pick up.
|SCHMITT|All these little craters are filled with glass.
|CERNAN| over the lunar surface.
|SCHMITT|I've seen glass covers.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|As I was saying, Bob, all these big blocks that I've looked at look like the ditroite rock that I was talking about - possibly upwards of 50 percent plagioclase rather than 30 like the Mare an intermediate gabbro of some kind -and one big block there has very sharply defined parallel parting planes. I think there is a foliation of minerals that parallel that parting but I'll have to check it out.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 21:12 CST 120:18 GET MC-467/3

|CAPCOM|And Jack, how's the visibility back to the center geophone?
|SCHMITT|Not bad.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're not having to worry about the pho t os ye t.
|SCHMITT|No, I've been checking it. Bob, my biggest problem is that the plies don't anchor.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|In general, the lines are following the contours. Whoops1- whoops -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|What's the problem, Gene-o? It won't screw on ?
|CERNAN| get a little side1force on them and - you know, with a helmet and gloves and what have you - sometimes they go on easy and sometimes they don't.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Boy, do I have a ball of spaghetti here, but the geophones1are going in the right direction. I hope you don't have an EMI1problem. Can the geophone lines cross, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that. Okay, no problem, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Hey, if you see me start to pull over that module there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I mean - no that won't hurt. It's just that it stretches the other geophones tight.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Alright, now we're watching Gene.
|SCHMITT|Okay, don't worry about it. I'll watch it. The anchors are completely unsuccessful on the module, anyway.
|CAPCOM|That looks pretty good, Gene-o.
|CERNAN| loose. I think I1could have pulled it back out with my hands.
|CAPCOM|That was not the idea.

|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I'm out by the big rock.
|CERNAN| doesn't collapse. I'm going to be awful disappointed. I think I could drive that heatflow flux through or neutron flux, at least for one probe, without any problem. Okay, Bob, if all goes well in the next few short moments, you'll have the final unleaded corestem automatic in this area on Apollo 17.

|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. We'll give you a minus for that. But it's still an A,
|CERNAN| But I'm going to accept an A minus 'cause I'll never get the wrench on it if I go any lower.

|CERNAN| how 1s th at?
|CAPCOM|That sounds great to me.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, and they're worried up here that you didn't clear the flutes, Geno, you want to tell them that, so they'll be happy.
|CERNAN| flutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And Jack, where are you lost on the plains ?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|No, if you cleared it, that's sufficient. And Jack, where are you on the plains of Taurus-Littrow, there?
|SCHMITT|I'm over here.
|CERNAN| where I am.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Right across the Rover.
|CAPCOM|Okay, are you getting ready to take geophone photos or ALSEP photos?
|SCHMITT|Getting ready to enable the old geophone.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I think that that means you've taken the geophone photos.
|SCHMITT|Oh yes sir, and I forgot the gnomon. (Laughter)
|CAPCOM|(Laughter) Hey, Jack, how about giving me a couple of quick readings here to satisfy some people. One, was there a decal on the LEME that you aligned it with. There's some controversy down here that there's no decal there, and the question is, if there isn't they want a reading out of the degrees. But we keep saying there's a LEME decal and we can't prove it.
|SCHMITT|I'll go prove it, Bob. I'll go by there. S t an d by.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|What's the other question?
|CAPCOM|And the second question is, is there a decal and was it aligned on the (garble) the 20 degree decal on the LSG. Was that also aligned?
|SCHMITT|Yes sir.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.

|CERNAN| core out with the drill, about 3 inches and it's all jacking material from there on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. Copy that. And we finally got some word from the Cape to prove to the people that the decal's on the LEME , so you don't have to go back by that, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Just at the right time.
|SCHMITT|I all ready have. It's reading 30. And here's the decal.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I guess I'd take ALSEPs word.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|One more, once more I tempt the fate of the god of the cables.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, we're getting ready here to try and save a little bit of time and we're saying that, why don't we just take two stereo pans for the ALSEP photos. First stereo pan will be in the vicinity of the original stereo pan, and the second one they suggested will be to the northwest of that original one.
|SCHMITT|Northwest. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, and I suggest that you go far enough that you can see the LEME past the central station.
|SCHMITT|Yes sir.
|CERNAN| just put a - I just put a plug in the top of that core and it disappeared from sight down the center - center of the core. I'll put a cap on it too. But, I want to plug it first. I want to - I want to get the rammer to plug it down.
|SCHMITT|Hey, Bob, where do you want us to focus on the pan to be?
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that.
|SCHMITT|About 15 feet?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| too small for the core.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Jack. Have you got a focus that's some what short of - well, between 74 feet and - just a little short of 7 4 feet.
|SCHMITT|I've all ready taken it at 15, Bob. I think that's pretty good.

|SCHMITT|Yeah, but the camera just stopped.
|SCHMITT|Oh. Man.
|CAPCOM|What was your question, Geno?
|CERNAN| And let me tell1you, it's coming, but, this thing is really in something. Oh.
|SCHMITT|Would you believe I'm out of film, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'm afraid I'll have to.
|SCHMITT|Why didn't I look at the number.
|CAPCOM|You want to give me a frame count.
|SCHMITT|Mag alpha is empty.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|SCHMITT|It's 158.
|CAPCOM|Copy, 15 8.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we're recommending magazine Hotel and we also suggest you take the second pan when you retake it at 74 feet.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What's the problem, Geno. You need some help?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 21:36 GET 120:43 MC-470/4
120:43:00|CERNAN| away. See if I can get this thing out of the way. See if I can get it out, is what I'm really saying. I may be jacking the treddle down into the surface. Change hands.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 21:47 GET 120:55 MC471/1
120:55:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, if you haven't put magazine Hotel on. We want to recall that and make it Magazine (garble). 
|SCHMITT|Well, Bob, I've already got it on.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Sorry about that.
|SCHMITT|Is that okay?
|CAPCOM|Leave it on.
|SCHMITT|I know what you want. You want color.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|CERNAN| also.
|SCHMITT|Scale - you mean Charlie.
|PAO|That jack applies about 5 to 600 pounds of p ressure .
|SCHMITT|Do you want color or do you want Charlie.
|CAPCOM|Stand by, Jack, if you're still at the Rove r.
|SCHMITT|Well, I'm still here, but I got Hotel on .
|CAPCOM|Okay. Leave Hotel on. We goofed. (garbled)
|SCHMITT|Well, okay. we'don't have much time, otherwise I'd change it. I should have thought of that my self.
|CAPCOM|Well - -
|SCHMITT|We haven't got a lot of time cause I've got a lot of jacking to do. Man - let me finish the pan and I'll come and help you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll get the neutron flux ready.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| get this thing out now that I got it.
|CAPCOM|Boy, you know that's what you call getting down into your work.
|CERNAN| I hope this core is appreciated.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. And I have word from the back room that it is appreciated.
|CERNAN| get it. You're going to have to bear with me. Man, I don't know what it did.
|SCHMITT|I was afraid that would happen. All those rocks.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Hey, Geno, how about whacking off for a minute there, you got going pretty hard.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72.21:47 CST 120:55 GET MC 471/2
120:55:00|CERNAN| late r .
|CAPCOM|It seems that way.
|CERNAN| a rest. You betcha. Man, I hate to say it, but I - I'm not 25 percent of the way there. I can feel it kicking now. I'm goin g c old.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. I got your pans and a couple of picture of the heat flow probe. Now, let's see -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. If you've got the two separate pans there, we're suggesting that you - since the PDR's still working on the quarry cover, we suggest you sample the large boulders and loose material on top of some of the smaller large boulders in the vicinity. I would look through some sampling here while Geno's pumping on the old jack.
|CAPCOM|Unless you've got - -
|SCHMITT|Want me to help him?
|CAPCOM|Well, unless you guys - okay. Let me finish. Unless you guys think that two guys can do that better than one, I'm not sure.
|SCHMITT|Gene, you want me to spell you a little.
|CERNAN| can do. Come on over here one minute. Let's see if I can -
|SCHMITT|Well, I can use up some of my water.
|CERNAN| with you on one end and let me stand on the treddle and we might be able to get a bigger bite. See, I can't get a very big bite. That's one of the problems.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, could you verify we have the LMP enable on -
|SCHMITT|Let's hope the jack doesn't break.
|SCHMITT|No, I'll get it. I knew there was some thing I needed to do.
|CERNAN| side. Let me put some weight here. See what kind of bite you can get.
|SCHMITT|Oh, man.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, no. It's coming though. Let me get my foot down there and you get the jack. See that's the key. Now, I think I can -
|CERNAN| down there. Okay, now try it. If we get a couple of inches at a throw, we're all right. There you go. Do that for a lit tle bit.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me put my foot on it. Okay, re ady ?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 21:47 CST 120:55 GET MC471/3
120:55:00|CERNAN| late r.
|SCHMITT|Okay. That's another good one. When you tired, I'll do that and you can do this.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Let me know when and I'll do that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Does it feel like it's loosening up at all.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, go ahead.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Stay there, stay there.
|CERNAN| UHB and my other ranks. Okay. Let's try that again.
|SCHMITT|You want to get over here and I'll do that for a while.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me - can I hold there.
|CERNAN| too. That seems like a little easier.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it looks to me like it's getting a little easier. Just hold on to me and -
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| still got it? Gone, momentary. I probably got a -
|SCHMITT|Get over here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me get over there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Why don't you come over here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think we're going to get it. Okay, come on over here and hold your foot against that thing. Just hold that little thing down, that's the main thing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we're getting it now. I need your foot on that thing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't know what kind of hole we're going to have. Okay. Get your foot down on that thing again.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I jacked the treddle down about 6 inches.
|SCHMITT|Okay. It's loosening up a little bit. I keep saying that, don't I?
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 21:47 CST 120:55 GET MC 471/4
120:55:00|SCHMITT|I can get it. Why don't you go get your - why don't you1get your pan and your -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|- LSPE and I'll - -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, go ahead and do that. I can get i t .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 21:56 GET 121:04 MC 472/1
121:04:00|CERNAN| me tell you. I know whose face is smiling back there.
|PAO|Ron Evans is coming up over the crater Copernicus in his 17th revolution of the Moon. He's right on the flight plan. Everything going good. Sounder data coming in good.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Houston. Mark it, enabled.
|CAPCOM|Okay, finally. Thank you.
|SCHMITT|Whoops, I moved your an - your central station. I've got a real eye on your antenna.
|CAPCOM|Stand by, Jack. Wait a minute.
|SCHMITT|Well, the gnomon's still aligned. I thought I moved it .
|CAPCOM|Okay, Let it be.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we should have raised the flag on this thing. It looks just the same as when I left it, but I thought I moved it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Is it okay, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Okay, leave it alone for right now, Jack and we'll get a reading on it.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|In a minute or so. And Jack I guess right now if you might get some fairly rapid samples in the area, since you're probably almost ready to leave. And can you tell us what you saw there in the vicinity of the -you were giving us a description of the boulders there and plateness of the - and alignment of the crystals plag - You want to emphasize that a little bit?
|SCHMITT|Okay, then. 1 will as soon as I get back over there with the sample bag. Bag 10 ECCO 10 ECCO is a sample of a very large boulder that's just beyond geophone 3. Just west - just south.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. 10 ECCO and boulder east of which geophone?
|SCHMITT|South of geophone 3. Southwest. And I got a few photos to docu - - document the boulder. I'm not sure I documented the sample, though.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|It - it's a - it's the the same kind of rock - the same kind of rock I saw near the LM and the gabb ro I'm beginning to lean towards 50 percent plagioclase, though.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| the hole and I'll tell you later why.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|SCHMITT|Oh me. Now I'll tell you later why.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 21:57 CST 121:04 GET MC472 /2
121:04:00|CERNAN| going to get all this stuff, now. If I lose my hole. Okay, it was right there. In our fiasco over here, we knocked everything over.
|SCHMITT|Did I ruin something?
|CERNAN| things and that's a major - major effort these days.
|SCHMITT|Can I help you?
|CERNAN| core in one hand, and I'm trying to get some core caps in the other. You'd be glad to know it's full, Bob, and while I'm the only one to see the bottom end right now I'm going to tell you it - it looks like - it looks like what I'm walking on but it's obviously not powdery. It's obviously very cohesive because it - it - the bottom ofthe core is not smooth, it's very jaggedy, and fragmental-like.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene-o. Very good.
|CERNAN| core here but I've got to do a few little housekeeping cho re s f i rs t .
|CAPCOM|Okay. Have you got that neutron flux over there in the vicinity or is it still back at the Rove r ?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, good enough.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And Jack, in your travels there, while you're doing some sampling, if you hap - happen to wander by in the vicinity - approximate vicinity of the double core - the deep core you might get us a rover sample of the soil there.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| an eighth or certainly less than a quarter of an inch from the - from the bit.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Sounds good to me - sounds like a good canidate for CAP.
|CERNAN| the plug has been discarded.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| here before I get too upset. I need my - my - the drill besides performing admirably. Is a tool of necessity to lean over and pick things up with. Except when you let it fall down.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 21:57 CST 121:04 GET MC472/3
121:04:00|CAPCOM|And our next priority is to put the neutron flux down the hole, we hope.
|CERNAN| know if I can find the hole. It's in the shadow now. I guess I can see it down there. There it is. Okay. You asked, and with a little bit of luck, you shall receive. Listen, I'm earning my three and a quarter a day today. Oh boy, I don't want to lose the rammer either. Let me get that before that gets lost in the shuffle. we'don't want to lose that for sure. I bet you all think I'm stepping on that hole, don't you?
|CAPCOM|I don't. John doesn't either.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I see no - no clear alignment of plagioclase pyroxene in this rock. That's the one with the parting in it. It looks as if - integrating what I've seen here and over at the big rock, the geophone rock, I -that the layering or the foliation or the parting, whichever it is, is the result of variations in vesicle concentrations. The sample 10 ECCO is a sample of the more coarsely vesicular rock. I could not get one of the finer - part - more finely or non-vesicular fragments. But I got pictures of i t .
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that and do you see any of the (interruption) -
|SCHMITT|I'm having trouble -
|CAPCOM|Good.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Can you see any of it in the soil on top of some of these medium sized boulders?
|SCHMITT|there's soil. A little bit of dust in some of the holes. But I - there's not enough to sample at this point. I may find some later.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. He's picking up the old -
|SCHMITT|Vesicle walls do not seem to be as shiny. Most of them seem to have dust in them.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|the vesicles are not cleanly spherical - they're spherical but they have fairly rough outlines. They look as if there's been some re-crystallization.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|CERNAN| section is on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you, Gene-o.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 GET 121:13 CST 2207 MC 473/1
121:13:00|SCHMITT|I picked the wrong rock to sample with a scoop, I'll tell you that.
|CERNAN| to the world right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene-o and - let's
|SCHMITT|Another key to the world is one of -
|CAPCOM|Gene-o, stand by, hold it.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, make sure that top of it doesn't go down through the hoe too, and disappear, like putting it through the treadle, or if you're sure that the - or whatever.
|CERNAN| know I had to take the treadle off - the jack wouldn't go down and no way I could put that treadle - well, let me turn it on first. That was a good thought. It may, it may go down in that hole. That would be terrible.
|CAPCOM|How big's the hole look, Gene-o.
|CERNAN| enough to put this down. Let me — let me use my judgement on it, and a little ingenuity.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|How about that, loud applause, loud applause.
|CERNAN| Bob, I couldn't get the jack and it - it - it made the hole oblong when I - but it's all right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay beautiful, beautiful.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and why don't we get you 2 guys together again, now, and break down the core and press on. And we've got alittle revision here to the EVA, I'll get with you in just minute on, as soon as I find out what it is.
|CERNAN| that makes me feel pretty good.
|SCHMITT|Bag 174 - 474, 474 soil from next to this big rock it's the fillet, I can't get a chunk of the rock.
|CAPCOM|Copy 174 fillet beside the big rock. And Jack, while you're coming back here to the rover, why don't you get more rover sample in the vicinity of the deep drill while you and Gene get ready to take on the core stems. And because of being a little bit behind here, what we're doing is we're getting prepared to drop station l'*favor of doing Steno, over.
|CAPCOM|And I'll get with you on more details on that in a minute.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|You're about between 35 and 40 minutes and part of the problem is that we're a little short on oxygen on Gene's PLSS it looks like it's a 6 minute and 4-6 hours and 45 minute EVA from that point of view, which means that we have
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:07 CST 121:13 GET MC-473/2
121:13:00|CAPCOM|to - we'd have to leave Station I too early, which is another - which is the reason to curtail Station I apart from just behind which is what the hooker was.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I'm approaching the rear of the rover. I've got the core, the cap, the wrench and the rammer.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Well, it's something you can't help. Even the surgeon agrees with me on that one.
|CAPCOM|And we're thinking Jack and Gene, what we're doing is planning on going to the west side of Steno and that boulder field that's partly out to Station I.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you want me to get a - you want to break that and I'll go get this sample, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Gene has pretty well chewed up the ground, I helped him, do you want me to get a little ways away from it,
|CAPCOM|Stand by, I don't think we're interested in a surface sample in the last top little bit ring, it's just a in the top - just a surface sample, stand by one.
|CAPCOM|Anything there in the dirt, Jack, it doesn't have to be a skim sample of any sort.
|CERNAN| tail end of the rover, here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, congratulations.
|CERNAN| broken down yet.
|CERNAN| bit of help.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, beautiful.
|SCHMITT|And I have to tell you which end I am taking it from.
|CAPCOM|Says we got the cap and alpha on one end and Bravo on the other end.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob mixture of soil and rock, in 475.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy 475.
|SCHMITT|Soil came from about - the soil came from about 5 centimeters - 0 to 5 centimeters.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that beautiful.
|SCHMITT|And it's about 3 meters - 3 meters - 3 meters from the hole - well -
|CERNAN| was the first 3 sections.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|3 meters from the hole, I got stereo over 4 with - at 11 feet and one after at 11 feet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. And how about a frame count there, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Stand by.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:15 GET 121:22 474/1
121:22:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No - now I can get it. Boy, this system works good.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let. me see. Let me configure the old LSPE sampler here.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston, Jack, this is Houston. Ove r.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|When you took those two pans, was one at 15 feet and one at 20 feet?
|SCHMITT|One was in focus at 15 and 74.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|there's a partial pan - there's a partial pan on mag A, which was taken at 15.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I understand.
|CERNAN| guess Delta and Echo is a 2 section core, Delta being adjacent to the first section of 3.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that, Gene.
|CERNAN| last one is Foxtrot and it's on tight.
|CERNAN| going to take a big drink of water here. We got 3 cores, we got the neutron flux down and we got 2 heat probes and ALSEP. Don't care if we are 30 minutes late. Bob, did I give you the last cap ?
|CAPCOM|That's okay, Gene. we'don't really need it - the way they're broken down, there's no problem - the 32 pans out and the bravo on the bit end, there's no problem there.
|CERNAN| off? Pull this off, yes. Rotated 180 there, no, no, just the total thing that's good. There you go.
|SCHMITT|Like that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay and 17 - go ahead.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm going to let you do it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| speak, let me get it over with.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Did you punch grav. a second time, that's identical to the first one.
|CERNAN| want, isn't it?
|CAPCOM|Yes, but you - did you punch grav. after the first reading there at the ALSEP?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:15 GET 121:22 474/2
121:22:00|CAPCOM|Or are you just reading me the same measurements you did before?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| where I've punched grav, you've got it written down somewhere.
|CAPCOM|Yes, and I didn't copy your punches grav, but -
|CERNAN| to get the treadle on the neutron flux and rammer, I did not punch grav.
|CAPCOM|Okay, so that's the same as the first one, never mind, thank you. And guys - we're ready for you guys - as you go along here to do the geo prep and press on, as I say, we'll go to Steno and come back from there and do the SEP. Any questions about that? We'd also like to know if you have the gnomon, back of the Rover?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes we'do.
|CERNAN| you put that in that dapper tool bag, there?
|SCHMITT|Yes, sir.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| pocket, I hope.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| need one, let me get it.
|SCHMITT|I've got mine on.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| doesn't it?
|CERNAN| see the gnomon.
|SCHMITT|I put it there so I wouldn't forget it.
|CERNAN| is the key, we might - look at those covers gloves.
|SCHMITT|I guess we can take those covers off, I don't know if we ought to or not.
|CERNAN| changed my mind. I want to look at my gloves before I takethemoff.
|CERNAN| camera, obviously. This is my camera. I got the bad dispenser on it. It's not a bad days start. Bob, is the ALSEP working good ?
|CAPCOM|The last we heard, it was working great, guys. We'll check again though.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:15 GET 121:22 474/3
121:22:00|CERNAN| the floor pan cap dispenser let me get that. Jack.
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| easy, but it's also pretty easy to kick dust all over those battery covers so don't even get on it till I put those covers down.
|SCHMITT|Yes, hey, I guess we ought to press on and then we're going to station 1.
|CERNAN| - we got to -
|CAPCOM|Roger. We are going to play it per the check list. Jack will carry the things back, and Gene will get the thing alined, and we'll go out to the SEP sight, and then we'll press on from there down to Steno. Over.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And right now -
|CERNAN| PLSS?
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, never mind.
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| around, oh man, what have you been in? Hallelujah.
|CERNAN| you reach the rammer, it's right in front of you?
|SCHMITT|Oh, yes.
|CERNAN| it is. Okay, the caps are in. Here it is.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|(garble)
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yes, we're going to hand over (garble)
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| I'll give you as CB2.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| to work. Oh, man, like a charm so far. Oh, except your doggone harness is off, too, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Is it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me get at it.
|CERNAN| put her underneath and tighten it up again,
|SCHMITT|this one here?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I might turn around then, I could -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think it is - yes, that's where it is on yours.
|CERNAN| sides alright though.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:15 GET 121:22 474/4
121:22:00|SCHMITT|Let me. I got it so tight now. Okay, now I got it. CE RN AN1Okay .

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|this does.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And this goes here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got most of them. Not all of them. They revised1the whole camera.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|Wait a minute. I ought to get that, I guess.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Pull.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|two, and the hook's still hooked. Check for sure. Those hooks weren't designed for new bags.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. They don't want us to use (garble) you1guys, when you get to it, pull it out.
|SCHMITT|(garble)
|SCHMITT|I'll get it right now.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes. I sort of thought you might like it out of there. Let's stay away so I don't get a cable and I don't get dust in the mirror. The alinement is still

|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, roger.
|SCHMITT|Hey, you're turning our voice around, Bob. We're getting a repeat.
|CAPCOM|I said close the covers please.
|SCHMITT|that's right. I heard what you said, but you're turning our voice around.
|PAO|Jack Schmitt on his way back to the lunar module.
|SCHMITT|(Singing) I was strolling on the Moon one day, in the merry merry month of December -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|- May - that's right.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|- when much to my surprise, a pair of funny eyes (singing)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:26 CST 121:32 GET MC475/3
121:32:00|CAPCOM|Sorry about that, guys, but today may be December.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|(Humming)
|CERNAN| I'm ready to go mode switch 1. I guess I'll just wave goodbye. You look pretty clean. I won't touch you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CERNAN| counterclockwise. Here we go. Counterclockwise, facing aft. Okay, I'm going to mode switch number 1.
|CAPCOM|Rog, we can confirm that.
|CERNAN| blanket switches 100 percent, right.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's affirm.
|CERNAN| and cover my tongs — -
|PAO|We'll lose TV while Gene Cernan drives the Rover to the surface electrical property site, about 100 meters east of the lunar module.
|CERNAN| if my earner's going to work. Bob, I'm on Bravo - mag Bravo and frame count 19.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene.
|PAO|Jack Schmitt has carried the core stems back to the lunar module where he will pick up the transmitter for the surface electrical property experiment and carry it out to the site where it will be deployed.
|CERNAN| cooling.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|CERNAN| on. Ready to get on. Okay, you want us to make the (garble).
|SCHMITT|that rock by your front porch is really a major nuisance.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What's the problem.
|CERNAN| I still haven't learned how to get on yet. You think after three times, I'd know better. I know better, but it's -
|SCHMITT|Okay, I've got the transmitter. I'm heading west. Or east. Heading east. Sorry about that. Okay, I'm primary. Okay, you want an - to have initial of your high, Houston.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:26 CST 121:32 GET MC475/4
121:32:00|SCHMITT|By the way, Bob, Station 6 is pretty obvious up on the hill. It's fairly high up. I don't know whether we'll get to drive up there or not.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You can see the boulders and that's how you can tell, right.
|SCHMITT|Yep, and the crater. A shame not to - well, maybe that's the wrong one. I'll have to check the map. A shame not to go to Station 1 - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:33 CST 121:40 GET MC-476/1
121:40:00|SCHMITT|- to go to Station I.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Why don't you consider Station I as a possibility. Okay, Bob, let me give you some numbers.
|CAPCOM|We're ready.
|SCHMITT|Sun shadow is 0 -
|CAPCOM|We're ready.
|SCHMITT|I am rolled it right 4 degrees, I am pitch0 .
|CERNAN| indicator can't be right.
|SCHMITT|I question that.
|CERNAN| left a couple of degrees.
|SCHMITT|Are you happy with that Bob, our roll indicator is indicating - make it 3 degrees - 3 degrees right.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I copy - okay and I copy - okay, torque to 279 will be the heading, 279.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| breaker in Bob was 23 - 2 34.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that we'll torque that to 279.
|CERNAN| here .
|CAPCOM|Roger that.
|PAO|Steno is a crater about 1 kilometer south and east of the lunar module.
|PAO|Station I was -
|SCHMITT|LMP is 39 percent 3.88 and no flags, no tones.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, copy that.
|SCHMITT|I'm at the sep sight, and I found a place I think we can lay out a pretty good grid.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and when you lay it down there, we want to put it down with the gnomon side away from the Sun (garble) a thermal constraint this evening just as the EVA started.
|SCHMITT|Okay, away from the Sun, gnomon, do you want the gnomon side or corner?
|CAPCOM|The gnomon side away from the Sun, the side with solar pan needs to be in the sun. The sides with solar panels don't have to be in the shade.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| she's zeroed and I'm torqued, and I'm ready to press on, reset is back off, okay Jack here I come.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I'm facing the other way.
|CERNAN| is the LM, boy that's tough driving in the sun.
|SCHMITT|Go right to the LM and then a little bit to your left, to the left of the LM.
|CERNAN| reading here.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:33 CST 121:40 GET MC-476/2
121:40:00|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Gene.
|SCHMITT|You get in that shadow up there and you're all ri ght.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, we want the range and bearing at the LM, I'm glad you remembered.
|CERNAN| oh, oh don't get in there. I even got the low gain working for you, I don't know if you're using it.
|CAPCOM|I think we're using the LM right now.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, everything I've seen so far indicates that the so called sub-floor boulders if we have gotten that deep are this gabbro. I'm out here at the SEP site and the large blocks are filled with plagioclase dirkscene -
|CERNAN| way out.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CERNAN| right in front of the MESA.
|CAPCOM|Okay, beautiful Geno, thank you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the zap has nice white halos although for the most part the rock's too coarse to show them very well. Some of the larger ones have white halos. We may not be down to the sub-floor, but it's hard to say.
|CERNAN| barely moving.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Right out over there.
|CERNAN| and range and some numbers here.
|SCHMITT|Meet you over there.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, I did see a dense grey rock that's different than the others on my traverse out here, we'll try to find some of that too.
|CERNAN| sep site.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that Geno, and how about giving me amp hours and batteries just as long as you're there.
|CERNAN| 112 and 110, batteries are 9-92 and about 1 oh 112.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that Geno.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yeah, okay thank you.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Say again there, Gene, you're going to go to re s et , ri ght ?
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:33 CST 121:40 GET MC-476/3
121:40:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Jack, you can be getting on, you won't need the bomb and I guess you won't need the LMP camera unless you want it. You'll be deploying the bomb at Steno.
|SCHMITT|I thought we were playing it by the checklist Geno, here's the bomb -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|charge.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yeah, it just happens that the station is at the place we're going to deploy the charge.
|SCHMITT|Okay, well we got it off.
|CERNAN| to go Jack?
|SCHMITT|Not yet.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we're going - okay let me fill you in on the plan, guys, we're going to go to the west side of Steno which is where you would have driven by anyway, and the stop will be at the 340/1.2 which is the little Delta for EP 6. Plan on spending 30 minutes there sampling primarily boulders.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:43 GET 121:50 MC-477/1
121:50:00|SCHMITT|Okay, Geno, west side of Steno there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You got a good feeling on how to head out of he re .
|CERNAN| now that I'm down there on the back side of Trident, and make sure that that's what I'.m ..looking at, is Trident over there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me try to get on this thing.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, just to fill you in a little bit more here. We're looking at a 6.45 EVA, we've given you 15 minutes to drive to station 1, 30 minutes at station 1, and 15 minutes to drive back to the SEP and deploying the SEP for 22 minutes, and then a 40 minute closeout at 6 plus 45.
|SCHMITT|I'm sorry Bob, after 30 minutes at station 1, what did you say?
|CAPCOM|Okay, and then we're going to drive back, and there's a 15-minute return to the SEP sight and then 22 minutes at the SEP sight to deploy to the SEP and then, return to the LM in 45 minutes for the close out.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Understand.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you strapped yet?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we've starting getting this Rover to facing a 90 degree to the seats I think.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Right through dust?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I tried to knock it all off my feet.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| around - around Trident east over here.
|SCHMITT|I wish I didn't have this charge. Should have played it by the checklist. I wasn't paying attention.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We're on the move, Bob.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it's got to be.
|CERNAN| You really want to hit about 29 - No, no, no, no, wait a minute -we want to go south east 181 - -
|CAPCOM|17, we'll start out on the same general traverse that you've been on. It's just that we'll stop it sooner.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we understand. We're -
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|We're just getting out bearings, Bob.
|CERNAN| Jack. See that. That's got to be Trident east. That's the big one.
|SCHMITT|On the right or the left. C E RN AN1On the right. Y e ah .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:43 GET 121:50 MC477/2
121:50:00|SCHMITT|And we - Poppy - We're just over about where -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy, it sure is.
|SCHMITT|Whee.
|CERNAN| (garble) Boy,1I tell you I've got to get out east.
|SCHMITT|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|Gene, I think I'm going to head about 120 out of here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got it.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And 17 Houston, for you advice, we're trying to use the low1gain antenna on this traverse also. Might try and be good guys and turn it for us when you have to.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Bob.
|CAPCOM|That's general reminder #1.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. We've got to go out here southeast. What's that big map look like in relation to Bear Mountain to you.
|CERNAN| Okay. Okay, it calls for 116 at .6 (garble) SEP.
|SCHMITT|I ended up with the charge in my hand.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Right here.
|CERNAN| station - that1must be Emory over there. See with all the blocks in the wall.
|SCHMITT|Where you looking, which way.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Way over there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that may very well go - this is very easily Steno right over here. Let's see we're between the 2 big ones -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that would be Powell on the right, you think?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, it sure doesn't.
|CAPCOM|How about a range in bearing, guys, if we can help you.
|SCHMITT|Okay, 330.3
|CAPCOM|Okay, it sounds like you're probably just driving by the1east Trident or Trident 3.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:43 GET 121:50 MC-477/3
121:50:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|By God, if it is that's incredable. That's hard to believe. Well, you're going to go in a hole in - you're right, no problem.
|CERNAN| well if that's Trident -
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack if you - do you have your camera on, if so, could you give me a frame count some time?
|SCHMITT|Bob, I've got my hands full with this charge.
|CAPCOM|Oh, okay, they forgot about that one, sorry about that.
|SCHMITT|Looks like 45.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Thank you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey that is - don't you suppose that's Trident?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we were quite a ways from Trident.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|If that's true we're at about 42.4, that's about right, we're half a mile - that's about right. Well when I was looking at Trident it isn't nearly anywhere near that big.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes sir. We're all right now. That's got to be Trident. What we were looking at before. - I've got to stop and see what that is. I've got to look at this map when we get in.
|CERNAN| b etween.
|SCHMITT|Well, wish I could take picutures. Take a few, but -
|CERNAN| pressing.
|SCHMITT|(garble) We can get them coming back.
|CERNAN| hands are giving out. I wish I hadn't said, "Follow the checklist." Okay, we're at .5 and 346. And the surface has not really changed except slightly more hummocky and rolling, because of a larger number of irregular depressions, or craters. The boom - The rocks at first glance from the Rover, look very much like what we had around the LM. That's the big ones.
|CAPCOM|And 17, you might be - Jack, you might be expecting water flag and a tone in a couple of minutes, go to OX.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And CDR will be about 5 minutes after that.
|CERNAN| s oon -
|CERNAN| over there -
|SCHMITT|I don't think we're too far off. Okay, there's my - I've got to go to OX.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I hope so.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Houston, do you see me in OX?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 22:43 GET 121:50 MC-477/4
121:50:00|CAPCOM|Stand by. Roger. We see you in OX.
|CERNAN| Jack, and then we won't get any roll angle.
|SCHMITT|Okay, how far in do you come?
|CERNAN| meters. I may be coming up on the edge of it, but I don't know, I'm - I'm on the right bearing. Yeah. We're all right.
|SCHMITT|Steno has got that dimple on the North. Boy, this is a heck of a way to start out our navigation 'cause it's into the crosssun here, not cross sun, but sun. Now, that's got to be Powell, wouldn't you say?
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:53 CST 121:59 GET MC478/1
121:59:00|SCHMITT|- must be, must be. That's Steno with all the blocks in it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|See this high point out there coming ahe ad.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that should give us our bearing I hope. I can't hold that bomb any longer.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm going to drop it at my feet.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, it's there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It will.
|SCHMITT|My hands aren't going to be any good for sampling.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|SCHMITT|Okay, if that's Powell, why don't we go over there? Think the thing to do is get up on that little ridge the re.
|CERNAN| Steno when we get up there. Bob, we're 342.9.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|CAPCOM|3.0 and 1. -
|CERNAN| way ?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, roger. Beautiful. 340 and 1.2 is what we expect the station to be.
|CAPCOM|And it should b e up on the top of a little bit of a rise. That you see coming up there. Almost to that rise. You ought to be in the vicinity of a very large boulder.
|CERNAN| a lot of big boulders - whoops! Let me take a look into the Sun here. That doesn't look what I thought Steno looked like. There's no dip there. 1.2 he said. All right. This is it over here, though, I guess.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Steno ought to be at - right close to 9 o'clock there, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Either that or your three o'clock.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| it doesn't impress me as what I saw in the LNA. How much time have we got to drive now, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:53 CST 121:59 GET MC478/2
121:59:00|CERNAN| That's Steno, I guess.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Gene and Jack, we'd like you to if you're in the vicinity, we think you're just about there. We were planning on you leaving the set and getting to this place at about 4 plus 58 and we're showing about 5 plus 00 right now so you're right on time. And if you're at 340 and 1.2 in that vicinity, you must be at the station or very to it where you can see. Over.
|SCHMITT|Well, it doesn't look real familiar Bob, as far as Steno's concerned. Okay, I got - I think they can locate us if we work that block field right there.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, on the map we're showing, Jack, that you're probably looking at, you're seeing that there's a couple of boulders just above at about the - with north being 12 o'clock, there are a couple of boulders at 9:30 position on Steno and then there's a couple of more at about the 9 o'clock position on Steno and we're putting the station right in the midst of all those boulders. Over.
|SCHMITT|Well, Bob, I don't know. It's hard to follow that that's where we are. I'm not sure. It doesn't look like what I expected Steno to look like - -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. What's the range and bearing one more time.
|SCHMITT|Okay, 346, 1,1. I think it would almost be worth - I bet that's Emory up on that hill. It's got to be.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, well let's - we're approaching a boulder field here. Wish we could have gotten near one of the big ones, but let's do it. We're going to run out of time.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, guys. There's no point in deviating around and spending 15 minutes trying to get to a particular spot or down to a bigger boulder. You must be near the vicinity. If you're really worried about it, I guess you might drive a little to the east of the crater, unless you're there. Over. Your judgment.
|SCHMITT|No, we're okay. We got a good place.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm parked 180.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Stand by a minute.
|CERNAN| mean ?
|CAPCOM|Okay. I was just wondering about where you were going to park. Go ahead and park 180.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 22:53 CST 121:59 GET MC478/3
121:59:00|CAPCOM|I was questioning whether they wanted us to park into the Sun.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|180 is a good heading.
|CERNAN| 1.2, 1.1, 110, 108, 100 and 118, and offscale on all of th e b o ulde rs.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I copy that.
|SCHMITT|Bob, can we'deport.
|SCHMITT|Okay. You want this charge deployed here?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack.
|SCHMITT|I can deploy it now.
|CAPCOM|You can deploy it now, that's good.
|PAO|That's a one-pound charge for the lunar seismic profiling experiment.
|CAPCOM|Beautiful, we'll give you the Caper of the Year Award.
|SCHMITT|Boy, you're going to have to give me the Dunce of the Year Award after this.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that will be in the pan, Geno.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|SCHMITT|Bob, you got (garble)
|CAPCOM|We can confirm that is a EP 6, right?
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. Do you read?
|CERNAN| a 20 meter blocky rimmed crater, it's about 3 to 4 meters deep. All the blocks on the rim like the pyroxene, plagioclase, gabbros and vesicular rocks - seen at the LM. At least all that I've seen so far.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I copied that, Jack. And is this crater to the east or west?
|SCHMITT|It's to the northwest of the Rover.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|the vesicle population - the vesicle population varies from about a millimeter to one centimeter. It forms about 15 percent of the rock - 10 to 15. And I've given you grain size and - for the rocks near the LM and that goes for well for this one.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that, Jack. Very good.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 23:09 GET 122:07 479/1
122:07:00|CERNAN| still of somewhat unknown origin, and we'll try and get a sample along a parting plane. It's fairly evident in one of the bigger blocks.
|CERNAN| went on OX water, do you want me to turn my primary water off -I don't have to do I?
|CAPCOM|No, no, no need to.
|CERNAN| cover all bets. Okay, Jack. I think, I've got my housekeeping done .
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Hey, get your hammer, we're going to nee d it.
|CERNAN| time I used it. Okay.
|SCHMITT|Bob, you're going to want a core at this site?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'd like to get number 1 priority, will be some black samples, including any dirt that was on the blocks, if there is such, and then the second priority is a rake soil sample, the third priority is a double core. Then, also in there, the pans, of course, and other documented samples. But double core is there, although it is third priority.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Gene, do you think, got your gnomon, huh?
|CERNAN| get with GGE. When you said, bring a hammer I came -
|SCHMITT|I'm sorry.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I shouldn't have -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Nothing disrupts your thought patterns more then somebody saying something.
|SCHMITT|Well, listen, this is my first geology stop. I guess I'm entitled to do that, Bob, you ready for a mark?
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Okay, mark it, the lights flashing.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, let's hit this - should be able to work on that one, it's up to the edge, but we can chip it -the parting plane, and that's one of the things that's come up that I think is of interest, we've got to figure out why they have that foliation in them.
|CERNAN| ones I've seen around.
|SCHMITT|they're all about that - Gene, they're too - they're either that or mixed with that variety - in the same boulder you'll see a non-vesicular - a relatively nonvesicular. Okay, that's the, watch your shadow, that's the down sun. Oh, Okay, right into the sun.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 23:01 GET 122:07 479/2

|SCHMITT|If you can hook your -
|CERNAN| try and get it1right up on top is where I'd like to -
|SCHMITT|If you hit it on the right side, it'll go this way, maybe. There you go. Good man.

|SCHMITT|Okay, bag 476 is the rock sample with a little bit of the soil near it - With a chip - Chip off the rock, and it's the - watch it Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|If I go down there, that thing is about 15 feet deep.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, now, do you think you can chip off of the other side of that plane, up on the edge?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|then we'll get the soil, and maybe just a small rock,1one non chipped.

|SCHMITT|Yes, sir. But we got to sample something.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bag 454. Okay, and the flashes are from inside of (garble) and recrystallized vesicles. They look like pyroxene flashes, they could be ilmenite.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, and let me get in there and get some soil.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|From the north side, woops, okay, the bag tore around that, it's pretty jagged rock, but I think it'll hold.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|In yours, okay. It's in Genes sample collection bag. And a scoop sample. You got a bag handy, Gene? Okay, bag 455, Bob. It's from the west side of the rock. It's under a slight overhang of the rock - in a shadow, anyway. Okay, that's from about 1 centimeter downdeep, 1 to 2 centimeters, and the next one is down to about 5, 5 or 6, and it's got some chips in it. That's bag 456, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, (laughter)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|1.2 in kilometers is a long way from the LM, look at the Challenger down there. Makes you get a feel for how big this valley really is.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 23:01 GET 122:07 479/4
122:07:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got it.
|CERNAN| in your bag.
|SCHMITT|I learned how.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| mas. Okay, lets - you happy there?
|SCHMITT|Yes, let's - get your after - and if we can, we might get just a block instead of breaking on it, and then we'll go to the rake.
|CERNAN| he re, too, huh?
|SCHMITT|Yes, but the rake's next, as you might imagine. Geno, now this looks a - this stuff here looks a little less vesicular, why don't we try that one.
|CERNAN| vesicularity changes from a hummocky vesicular to a very fine vesicular, look at this. Let me try and crack - get a — see that? The change?
|SCHMITT|(garble)
|SCHMITT|Yes, that's what I'm after, that's it. Let's see if I can't crack -
|SCHMITT|that's it. That's what I saw in that other boulder.
|CERNAN| and get that contact.
|SCHMITT|You ought to get a piece of both, I think you can get, if you can reach down there.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:12 CST 122:18 GET MC-480/1
122:18:00|SCHMITT|that's a contact in a rock.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Beautiful. And you guys - do you guys see any 2 meter boulders around there?
|SCHMITT|We just sampled one.
|CAPCOM|That one showed up in the photos, I wonder why those down at the ALSEP didn't show up.
|SCHMITT|No, we're not where you think we are. We're not sure where we are. Gene, can you get down into that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, just - give me the shovel to hold my self with, give me the shovel.
|SCHMITT|How about that one?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Get that little piece.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's pretty hard, see if I can't - it's a little hard to hit.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I got the gnomon in the wrong place re ally.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Can you reach it.
|CERNAN| I got that other little piece in sight.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got that piece in sight, let me -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me get a (garble) right now.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, this is a sample of the - of the more coarsely vesicular rock.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got them both, I think actually we want a sample of both sides, but I wouldn't bet on it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got both of these.
|CERNAN| mound, just projecting on the edge of it?
|SCHMITT|Where are you looking?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Here?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Here?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|there?
|CERNAN| Right there, that piece.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me get these in a bag here.
|CERNAN| sample from either side of the contact anyway.
|SCHMITT|Did you get a bag?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:12 CST 122:18 GET MC 480/2
122:18:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|- you take the hammer, I got these in my hand I want to put -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay bag 477 is coarsely vesicular rock.
|CERNAN| in .
|SCHMITT|No, I only got one. Okay here's that other one, it had to fall right here. I don't think it ever - there it is; get your tongs.
|SCHMITT|Right here?
|CERNAN| just covered it up.
|SCHMITT|Got it, I got it1(
|CERNAN| good, a little dirt never hurt anybody.
|SCHMITT|Got it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|477 are 2 chips of the small, I think that will give you, if there's any compositional difference.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Look what you pointed at. Yeah I think you got it.
|CERNAN| on thatcontact.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, definitely.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack and Gene, when you get done with that boulder, we'd like you to move one to the rake soil sample, please, and that'll be a kilogram sample please.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|In bag 478 is the chip from the finely - more findly vesicular rock. Both of them are coarse. It s a small chip, but it'll tell the story, I think.
|CERNAN| go ahead and get a close up -
|SCHMITT|- get a close up and I'll get the rake. I'll get started on the rake.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Gene, if you can pickup one more rock in that picture, with your tongs, let's bag it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|As you come back.
|CAPCOM|And 17, we'd like to have you guys driving in 10 minutes, please.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's right, that's right.
|CERNAN| o f dus t.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I guess you want a sort of out in nothings land here, huh?
|SCHMITT|I can bag it for you Geno.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:12 CST 122:18 GET MC-480/3
122:18:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN| here.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I moved about 5 meters - 5 - 8 meters northeast of the rover, and as soon as Gene gets here with the gn omon.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, I've got a sample that was laying next to that boulder, I didn't get an after picture of it but, as I was taking my close up pictures it is on my side of the boulder just 4 or 5 inches covered with the dark mantle.
|CERNAN| probably show up in the befores.
|SCHMITT|Okay, we want a rake.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|that's in bag 479.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Gene let's rake - let's rake right out there.
|CERNAN| get the gnomon out there.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Bcb, as you might have seen from the camera up towards where we think Emory is, you get a pretty high concentration of boulders up there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I think that that's where we thought we were a little bit closer to Emory than you are.
|SCHMITT|Well, we thought about going on up there, although we're in a pretty good area here, too, from the standpoint of boulders.
|CAPCOM|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Again I think - facing the Sun -
|CAPCOM|But first -
|SCHMITT|I think for the most part large and small all the fragments seem to be - seem to be filleted or even mantled by the dark material.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I've got to clean my camera, I can't even see. What area are you going; to rake?
|CERNAN| gnomon and to your left, there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, we copy that that's a good observa tion, and I also gathered that most of the rocks look pretty much the same.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, except a change in vesicularity.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Except for size of vesicles where I described one as being a more hummocky vesicular type rock and the first time I noticed any of the dark minerals was when we took that one big flat chip off that boulder.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|I didn't look at it that close, to see what
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:12 CST 122:18 GET MC 4 80/4
122:18:00|SCHMITT|it was.

|CAPCOM|And 17, again we'd like (interruption) -
|SCHMITT|And Bob, I'm really only penetrating -I'm only penetrating about, at the most, about 3 centimeters into this area with the rake. I've picked up a very good sample of bla of1boulders but most of them were - were in that distance of1the surface and projecting out of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|SCHMITT|You ready, Gene?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, coming at you.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that, Geno.
|SCHMITT|there's two bags, I think.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me - Don't let me lose them. That's enough. Give me1a couple of small ones. Yep.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's good. That's good.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| rest of the rake1sample. They're all fragments.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. Now we need the kilogram on the soil. CE RN AN1Y e s s i r.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, ail the fragments are completely covered with - with the mantle in they are slightly - Oh, maybe 20 percent1vesicular. I just took a glance at them. But for the most1part they appear to be rounded and sub-rounded f ragmen ts.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Ahh, well, shoot. Start all over. Try it again.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Get some more.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Can you close it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's a good kilogram.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:21 CST 122:27 GET MC481/2
122:27:00|SCHMITT|Boy, I just can't even read my camera any more. I've got to learn how to control the dust. Yes, that's in .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I tried to blow the dust off my (interruption) -
|CERNAN| to be hard to get a double core here. We could try a single right there. Bob, we got time to get the core?
|CAPCOM|Negative. The core has been deleted. We'd like for you to get your second pan, Jack, and then we'll p ress on.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I'll get it over here where where our two sample sites are in view.,
|CAPCOM|Copy than.
|SCHMITT|Now I know why I felt that we were much too close to Trident than what I thought. We weren't really too close to Trident. Trident is way out here. That makes me feel better. A guy wouldn't know if he landed a hundred meters from a big set of crater like that. You know, on a landing site like this you ought to know exactly where you are. Anyway, I landed where I wanted to.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, ready for it.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene-o.
|CERNAN| going back. Right?
|CAPCOM|No, we will deploy charge number 7 on the w ay b a ck .
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. It will be deployed at the same location we originally planning on deploying.lt, which was in the checklist thera.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. I'm taking your camera.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, you got the pan or getting it?
|SCHMITT|Yes sir. And Bob, CR is on frame count 60.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Which one. And F&B is on 95.
|CAPCOM|Copy, 95.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Gene, we need EP-7 Jack, the scooper back on. Okay, get the charge. I'll set the low-gain and we'll be - ready to do it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:21 CST 122:27 GET MC481/3
122:27:00|SCHMITT|Bob, my impression right now is that the dark mantle may just be a - a - well at least in here it's indistinquishable from a regolith that might be derived from these other rocks. It seems to be a little dark for that but that might be the answer.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We (interruption).
|SCHMITT|EP 7.
|CAPCOM|We're also due on that again tomorrow and EP7 is the charge, right?
|CERNAN| mount the rover at 90 degrees when you kick up your feet you'll miss the dust.
|SCHMITT|Let me hook you before I do that.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Boy, you certainly ride high.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it fits fine. Okay. I'm in. Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|We're learning. I hope my bag was closed. Yours was. Did you get it?
|CERNAN| I thought that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we mark you underway.

|CERNAN| at 320.7 , huh?
|CAPCOM|Roger. It will be 0.6. We'll change that to 0.6 on EP7 but - and it will really be just where ever you cross 0.6 on the range. CERNON1Okay.
|SCHMITT|Well, it fit once. CERNON1Did you twist it, Jack? 180, that took out some of your - wait a minute - here. Which way. Well I can't see, your left hand is in the way now. Away from

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, I think you're learning. That's after the first EVA.

|CAPCOM|Roger. Looking at a range of 0.6, guys.
|SCHMITT|You've got a block right ahead of you. 11got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And remember you'll be taking photos coming back here, Jack, when you get a chance.
|SCHMITT|Yes, sir. Thank you. I got a few going out, Bob, but they weren't too well spaced.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And I assume you've got the low gain antenna alined.
|SCHMITT|Yes, sir, it's alined. Okay.
|CERNAN| that's too big for anything else.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Houston. The classic raindrop pattern over this fine debris. I'd say that the surface definitely is sorted. The fine regolithic material forming one fraction and then th'e brWcfcV 'arfofher. The blocks are -those blocks are greater than 2 centimeters in diameter, in general, make up less than 10 percent of the surface. But there are some big ones. And it's fairly uniformly distributed. They're blocks a meter in diameter.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| 21o'clock has probably got to be Sherlock. That's got to be Sherlock over there.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Probably.
|CERNAN| that we can go to is station 6.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, but you can't - we've got to get a high advantage point here one of these days.
|CERNAN| without any problem.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| Okay. No problem.
|SCHMITT|I'd rather stradle than go through those -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:30 CST 122:36 GET MC482/2
122:36:00|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, here's another crater about the same size we sampled at the last station and it doesn't have as many blocks but it does have blocks and from this distance their vesicular texture and their light color shows up very well. I suspect they're the same general kind. There's a glass bottom crater.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Have you got a range and bearings, the re, guys.
|SCHMITT|(garble)
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Did you take a picture of that?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're pointing right at station 6 I think, Gene.
|CERNAN| 4. I just want to get up here.
|SCHMITT|Not and one on the track but the one over there to the right of that.
|CERNAN| got mixed emotions which is 6.
|SCHMITT|that's probably - look over there to the left. You see that?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's Trident.
|SCHMITT|Look at this thing. That looks like the same kind of rock except it doesn't have any vesicles. There's some white stuff in that rock. Just let me take a quick (garble) See that one right in front of it? Take a picture of it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's a big zap, isn't it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that big zap pit. That same rock with big zap pits. I got to change the - well, okay.
|CERNAN| zap pits.
|SCHMITT|Kind of hard to say.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|they're white halos, it just has more of th e m.
|CERNAN| or 2 inches across.
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| and geometry squared away.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, how about range and bearing.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| 11 clicks right now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:30 CST 122:36 GET MC 482/3
122:36:00|CAPCOM|Copy that. Beautiful. Remember the charge goes off at 0.6.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, we want to -
|CERNAN| white mantle. Look over there. Can you look to your left.
|SCHMITT|Yes, it does. Yes.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Lean around that way.
|CERNAN| whity mantle. Whoo! That's my first real good picture of it. That is something.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got some of that. Okay, how are we'doing?
|CERNAN| what I don't want to do. Okay. We're at .6, how about 339.2 .
|SCHMITT|Okay. I got a couple of shots right in there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, that's good. Hold that heading. Whoa. That'll be good.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, whoa. Okay. Let me get my - I got my locator. Okay, this one we want me to get a partial pan until something is identified.
|CERNAN| turn that way anyway.
|SCHMITT|Okay, pin 1, pull, phase. Pin 2, pull, phase, pin 3, mark it, pull phase.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I copy that as charge number 7.
|SCHMITT|that's affirm.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And we'd like a frame number when you get done there, Jack, after you get it on the g r o un d.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I think we'll miss that. Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, start a pan around it, Gene.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, Gene.
|SCHMITT|Okay, now start slowly rolling.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, by a lot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, sir. Wheels cleared it by. It's got to be a lot low gain drop out?
|CERNAN| around? A lot?
|SCHMITT|About a meter.
|CERNAN| is stowed again.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:30 CST 122:36 GET MC482/4
122:36:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and a frame count now, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Okay, pan - the pan was more or less completed at 146.
|CAPCOM|Copy, 146 on auto.
|SCHMITT|Bob, you know, the more I look at this - watch out for those babies there - this dark dust, if you will, the more it doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd expect to have been derived from the underlying bedrock. But I think you're going to have to play that game in the lab right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. Can you -
|SCHMITT|We'll see how it works out later.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|It just seems dark and much too fine grain. It doesn't have the impression that you're getting the size distribution you'd expect to get by having all these blocks around.
|CAPCOM|Okay - -
|SCHMITT|Definitely, I think, at least in my mind, to population - size population - -
|CERNAN| overexposed, see that?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, why don't you take a pass over that way. Get through there?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Do you know where you are.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You in Trident.
|CERNAN| that's pretty steep down in there. I'd walk down there. I'm not sure I want to drive down there yet.
|SCHMITT|I didn't mean down in there. I meant right over there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And how about a range and bearing when you stop.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|336.4. Roger.
|CERNAN| Jack says it's going to be hard to tell whether this is regolith composed from the rock field we see around but -I get a distinct impression that you can see that there is a dark mantle over on top of almost all the rocks. Except that we have fresh glass perhaps in the bottom of some of these small craters.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:30 CST 122:36 GET MC482/5 
122:36:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Everywhere else there is actually mantle there I believe in and around some of the crevices - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 23:40 GET 122:46 MC 483/1
122:46:00|SCHMITT|Crushed glass possibly in the bottom of these small c rate rs.
|CAPCOM|Okay. -
|SCHMITT|Everywhere else there is actually (garble j I believe in and1around some of the crevices and in the vesticles and what have you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy -
|SCHMITT|It's all material that could be - It's material that1could be knocked in there by the local impact.
|CAPCOM|Okay, but again, you find a lot of material on top of the rocks.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Not, a lot Bob. Not a lot. It's there though.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|It's not nearly as covered with dust as they get when - when you drop one. It's just a - really a salting or a scattering of debris in those depressions on the rocks. 
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|the projections of the rock are perfectly c 1 e an .
|CAPCOM|Okay. I copy that.
|CERNAN| relatively (garble), except where the rocks are showing the boulders on the side, within the craters are evident, are suddenly covered over with this mantle. You don't see any good sharp ridges on walls on some of these craters. Even the small ones. 
|CAPCOM|Okay. Roger on that.
|CERNAN| this thing if you like1.
|SCHMITT|I think you have lost a fender, I keep getting rained on here1,
|CERNAN| ahead out there1,
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's probably it. It probably didn t stay. I can see it in a shallow, shallow end.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, boy, that's going to be terrible. That is really going to be bad.
|CERNAN| think I know when, because I just started to notice it.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I'm going to say what Gene said slightly differently. There just aren't a lot of very sharp bright craters, but there are some. All the craters seem to be pretty well, formed. It isn't an extensive mantle. Matter of fact, for example, hasn t filled the bay. We can deploy that thing now.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hasn't filled the bottom of the craters.
|CERNAN| see if I can get on it for you, okay, drop me off there. Look at that fender, look at the dust it produced. Look at the DAP LCRU. 
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it's going to make -
|CERNAN| Make, it west. Okay, I'm rolling west right now. That looks
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 23:40 GET 122:46 MC 483/2
122:46:00|CERNAN| losing that fender.
|SCHMITT|We're back in the set Bob, I'm starting to lay out my first track.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Copy that.
|SCHMITT|How's our time, Bob?
|SPEAKER|Okay. ^ _
|CAPCOM|Roger. You're about 5 minutes behind on the arrival time of the SEP. But we're - no real problem. And I assume that the range and bearing, when you got there was about zero.
|SCHMITT|Okay, good. Here let me leave my camera, let me read it1252, 2.5 and 0. I'm resetting.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Copy that.
|SCHMITT|And the LMP frame count is 197 and it was still turning1(Garble) are 108 105 and Batteries are 100 and 120.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy 100 and 120.
|SCHMITT|Oh, wait a minute, I need my camera, don't I.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|I don't think it's much good to you with a 197 there, Jack.
|SCHMITT|No I don't. I don't need my camera.
|CAPCOM|Roger on that.
|SCHMITT|We're deploying it. No, you take the pictures. I don't need it.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead, play it out.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hit It hard. Okay, Houston. The location is in about the least cratered area I could find, between the large crater or a large depression that's about, oh, ranges from maybe 50 to 150 meters behind the LM. That's maybe south, or east south east, and it's between that depression and another large depression, that is really a doublet with a blocky septum between them. That's to the northeast of the LM about 200 meters at the start of that second depression. I think we can get a nice layout, although, there'll be a general slope, I believe, towards the LM, of about a degree.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's no real problem, Jack. No problem, Jack.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let's see. Yes.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey, if you come right - (static)
|SCHMITT|that depression to the northeast, is at least a couple 100 meters in diameter and it's joined with one that's probably a comparable size just to the northwest of the first depression.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that too, Jack.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Great.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes. Yes come back.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 23:40 GET 122:46 MC 483/3
122:46:00|CERNAN| and are we going1to be full of dust.
|SCHMITT|Okay, there's no special -
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, yeah.
|CERNAN| was in training.
|CERNAN| deploy, can you bring your tongs.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| back at the LM1We're going to deploy the SEP. God Bless.
|CAPCOM|They all say to dust, Geno.
|CERNAN| Jack .
|SCHMITT|Well, I've got antennas all over the place, h e re .
|CERNAN| one second, I' 111make it a quick one.
|SCHMITT|that's all right I can handle it, I think here. But we're1going to need your tongs to pick them up and not get them all confused. Okay, where's the shadowgraph, there it is. LM quadrant, that's the SEP quadrant. For sure we lost that fender.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:50 CST 122:56 GET MC-484/1
122:56:00|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll deploy number 2 and 4, and let's see that's number 1, this one must be number 2, it is.
|CERNAN| running around in dust. Let me tell you, this dust isn't going to be fun tomorrow.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I won't bore you with details on why you see the antenna all over the ground, (laughter), but it has to do with 1/6 g.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, understand you dropped a couple of the antenna rails.
|SCHMITT|You know Bob there very - more accurately I dropped 3 of them. Bob, you know this fine grained dust that we're in could be ground uppyro clas tic, it might grind more easily than other things, and the blocks are just the - those blocks have been excavated from below that pyroclastic by the larger craters and some of the smaller ones in the area.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, MARK that.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, that would make a nice store wouldn't it.
|SCHMITT|Well you'd think glassy pyroclastic might turn into regolith a little bit faster than some of these other things, but we'll check that one out,
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|2 and you get 1, right there.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, did you get the rails straightened out again?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, they're okay.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SCHMITT|How could you stop a crew like this?
|CAPCOM|I don't know any way.
|SCHMITT|In all modesty I mean.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Geno, I'm on my way.
|CERNAN| awful easy to knock it over - I had that geophone module all over the place.
|SCHMITT|I can't tell whether I'm pulling gently or n ot .
|CERNAN|
|PAO|This antenna's being deployed in tracks that have been made by the rover.
|CAPCOM|Careful guys.
|SCHMITT|At least, we're pulling at the base. I better watch what I'm backing into there's a lot of holes around here .
|CERNAN| those pads, okay, I'm at the end Jack, are you having —
|SCHMITT|Hell, I -
|CERNAN| it twisted on my -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:50 CST 122:56 GET MC-484/2
122:56:00|SCHMITT|i'll be there in just a second.
|CERNAN| ah, ah, ah, ah,1ah yes, you're pulling it oi/er.
|SCHMITT|I'm not you are.
|CERNAN| h e re .
|SCHMITT|Okay, it's okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Stay, there, I'll take a picture.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No. Okay, I got it now.
|CERNAN| you're going to1fall over, just set it down and we'll stay away from i t.
|SCHMITT|Yes, you talked me into it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|(Singing the following lyrics: We were strolling in the park one day -)
|SCHMITT|Well, we've had lots of good ideas in our time.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I get number 4, which - where is it, is that the one on the ground?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|So take it, doesn't make any difference.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm deploying the - the LMP ' s deploying rail 3 for your1photography purposes.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Oh - hey push that in.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Ah, ah, ah, -
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm ready to stroll.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I found a brown rock that I'm going to bring b ack .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think it's the backside of a piece of glass, b ut it's round.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 23:50 CST 122:56 GET MC-484/3
122:56:00|CERNAN| it wiggled a little bit.
|SCHMITT|Oh we're - ooh, stop Geno.
|CERNAN| gonal to me. Got your picture?
|SCHMITT|Will have in a sec. Wait a minute, every- time I do something I change the setting, okay, I got it.
|SCHMITT|I straightened the line out a little bit better, after I took the picture, a few kinks in it. Now where's my brown rock. I saw it when I was driving with the rover, I knew I'd be able to come back here, because of the tracks. Looks like an old piece of bread.
|CAPCOM|Is that the one that came out of that?
|CERNAN| piece of - well it's a piece of glass all right, crumpled, part of it crumpled but, I got to get that in a bag, oh man is that a nice piece of glass, just laying out here all by itself. Jack, you got a bag handy, while I take my pan, I can't reach a bag, I got this sample in the wrong hand.
|SCHMITT|I don't have a bag.
|CERNAN| and give it to me, I'll take it back to the rover.
|SCHMITT|Watch, you've got a wire under your foot. C E RN AN1B a g n umb e r 460.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, bag number 460 ground glass.
|SCHMITT|I have one out on the north course -
|CAPCOM|Sorry about that -
|SCHMITT|- I have one out on the north course of the of -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 24:00 GET 123:06 485/1
123:06:00|CAPCOM|Sorry about that -
|SCHMITT|About half way out on the north course of the s teps.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Sort of a yellow-brown, as a matter of f act.
|SCHMITT|Okay, it says -
|SCHMITT|Locator forward to LM - I thought I took a pan here. The LM wasn't - okay.
|CAPCOM|Yes, the locater is really all you need, but a partial pan of the area would be appreciated.
|SCHMITT|Yes, I'm here, I'm going to get a partial p an , B ob .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| it'll be appreciated.
|CERNAN| and Bob, I'm on - if I can get where I can read it - on about 71 on my frame count, and let me give you - boy, we got to stay out of this area, Jack. We'll pick up these cables, just as sure as the devil. Oh, that fender. Boo - boo. Hey, Houston, will you look at your solar panel?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we see the solar panel.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|We noticed that, too.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, I got that one Geno.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I need gray tape.
|CERNAN| the gray tape.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| samples, but at least we got an ALSEP deployed. That gray tape, Jack, is not going to stick on anything with dust.
|SCHMITT|I know, that's what I was thinking.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You have a -
|CERNAN| without it, cut.
|SCHMITT|Don't back up in that wire -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Got it? Add that.
|SCHMITT|Yes, I guess.
|SCHMITT|Okay.

|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| them.
|SCHMITT|No, I think it's going to be easier this way.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Can you hold it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't know how long it will stay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Give me another one.
|CAPCOM|It's only got to stay for a few days, guys.
|SCHMITT|(garble) pull the whole thing over.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|See, I'm leaning on you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the piece of tape is so dusty - it may not work.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I was - is the gnomon the the zero mark?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's where it's supposed to be.
|CAPCOM|(garble)
|CERNAN| touching the - the1inner circle.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. And we have the transmitter switch1in standby, right?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|It will be -
|CERNAN| okay .
|SCHMITT|Forget those.
|CERNAN| were you, I'd just walk down.
|SCHMITT|Come here, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I need some support.
|CERNAN| this SEP is coining1off harder than it did when we'deployed it at the Cape.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 24:00 GET 123:06 485/3
123:06:00|SCHMITT|Are you there? It may not be harder, but it listed. Okay, now, I got to reorient it.
|CERNAN| let me look at it - the gnomon's right at zero.
|SCHMITT|Okay, right at zero.
|CERNAN| the same - zero gnomon and inner circle.
|CAPCOM|Okay, beautiful.
|SCHMITT|Let's go.
|CERNAN| it's up to you but -
|SCHMITT|Oh, I'll walk back.
|CERNAN| fender tonight. Well, let's see, I guess I'm supposed to -
|CAPCOM|Hey, Geno, I presume that the fender that came off is the fender that came off before, right?
|CERNAN| it was too dusty.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey, watch out for this antenna line I found out here.
|CERNAN| not going to change anything right now except get in and travel. All right?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. Time to go home.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|You'll have a nominal closeout time if you get back. We're right about on the time that we were figuring on for you guys to get back on. Right now you are at 6 hours and 11 minutes into the EVA.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, I discovered something - I learned a lot today, let me tell you.
|CERNAN| high gain is going to be out of whack here in a minute.
|SCHMITT|Hey, I got a football size rock of this vesicular, coarsely vesicular gabbro, Bob. It's off a large - 3 or 4 meter buried boulder from the LM about 30 meters.
|SCHMITT|Do you read, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear on that one .
|SCHMITT|Okay, it'll be in the big bag.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|SCHMITT|Undocumented, it's about - it's roughly tabular - 15 by 25 centimeters and about 5 to 7 centimeters thick. One face is very flat, looks like it was off of a parting plane, which were in that rock.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and if it'll fit in the SRC with all those other samples you might put it there because the SRC's going to be kind of empty
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 CST 24:00 GET 123:06 485/4
123:06:00|CERNAN| teries or anything?
|CAPCOM|No, it will be a heading of 013, which is hardly a change at all from the 012 in the checklist.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Jack, did you copy that?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 00:10 CST 123:16 GET MC 4 86/1
123:16:00|CAPCOM|Jack, did you copy my comments about putting that thing in the SRC perhaps?-
|SCHMITT|Well, it was pretty big, it s in the big bag now, wecandothat.
|CAPCOM|Well, I guess the other samples a small ones and put those soils in the SRC first.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I'm going right, right about here, now I'm done.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Right there.

|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, the SEP receiver temp is 45, 45.
|CAPCOM|Copy 45, beautiful.
|SCHMITT|You know, I think they left some Velcro of of this thing, Gene. There's no Velcro holding those flaps down.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Nope. Okay.
|CERNAN| thing - a minute or 2.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me get the high gain.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|(garble) you've got a couple left over, don t you?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep. _
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, let's put all the stuff in that bag, Jack, both the stuff that's in yours and the stuff that's in Gene's.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Samples — 2 samples from under the LMPs seat, get these under1the seat, clean you up here while I'm at it.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You hooked something and I'm not sure I closed your -
|SCHMITT|the other one - take a look at it, yep it's all closed. Okay,1you're good.
|SCHMITT|there you go.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Putting them in the bag that goes into the SRC -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN| (garble) dispenser1tools, okay, as soon as you get that, I'll take SCB-1 from you, and I'll close this (garble) 1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I gather you didn't have any rover sample today did you Jack?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, 1 had one sample bag in my pocket that h as a rock in it .
|CAPCOM|We'll have to take that out when we get in the rover.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Gene, where's that - you want to put that little rock?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well what did you do with it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Your side?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We can put that in one of the core tube slots he re.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay the rock that Gene picked up - early right at the start1is in a core tube slot in the SRC-1.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/11/72 00:10 CST 123:16 GET MC-486/3
123:16:00|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Gene, you want this one?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Latched.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, that's almost full of samples, and I think that big rock would be - probably wouldn't fit in there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, then we'll put that in the big bag.
|SCHMITT|It's in the big bag.
|CAPCOM|Good enough. And I gather there's no rover samples today, right?

|SCHMITT|Give a yell, when you need a spell there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| out something1we can make a fender with.
|SCHMITT|How about one of the others that's not as
|CERNAN| you know getting it - I had one to put on and it didn't stay, which is what I figured.
|SCHMITT|I thought you said it was broken, though?
|CERNAN| to come off either, unless you break them.
|CERNAN| neath it, it wasn't the fender's fault. Okay, the core tube is p acke d.
|SCHMITT|Everytime I read containment bag it fools me, I can't figure out what it is.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I read containment bag.
|CERNAN| kind too long, you've been living in the command module too long.

123:25:00|SCHMITT|that's a pretty good days work out you know. You know I don't think we need an exercise period. We can get back in there. I don't think we have to apologize to anybody. I'm sorry we'didn't get up in station 1. One of the main reasons is, I think, we could have to our navigation bearings a little bit better,
|CERNAN| it than met the eye.
|SCHMITT|this hole out here - you know, this is just such an easy thing to find out and identify yourself on the land in. But I tell you all of a sudden there is so many local hole that I can't think big enough.
|CERNAN| my dusting until - Am I in your way?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I'd like to get over there to get the - this last battery cover. I can. That's good enough. I can get over there now. I want to make sure these things stay clean because I don't want to walk,,

|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, containing bags from two cameras.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that and don't forget the scissors guys.
|SCHMITT|Don't worry I've got them right here.
|CAPCOM|Beautiful - don't want to go hungry.
|SCHMITT|It's a good call Bob. That's right.
|CAPCOM|And Jack,, give me your consideration or Gene on that question of bringing back the big bag into the cabin. The people down here are saying they want to bring it in and then we'd end up bringing it back out in the second EVA. What do you guys think of that?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we can do that - I guess just cause they're rocks in there, huh? I'd like to do that - look at that rock with the handle in it.
|CAPCOM|So then we'd be taking it back out in the second EVA if you guys are aggreable to that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Ah Jack do you think it'll go on the STB?
|SCHMITT|Say again.
|CAPCOM|Do you think it'll go on the STB number 2?
|SCHMITT|What would - the rock?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's right.
|SCHMITT|Well, it'll go in there it's not that big.
|CAPCOM|Okay why don't you put it in STB - why don't you put it in STB 2 and bring that in instead. Leave SRB out and we'll just leave STB 2 in forever.
|CERNAN| are those things going over? What is that, Jack. Hey, something just hit here. What blew? Hey what is that?

|SCHMITT|No the one you deployed. They are over high gain antenna.
|CERNAN| hit by a - by a - look at that stuff just keeps flying over the top of our heads. I thought: we were the closest witnesses to the lunar meteor impact. However, is that the same glass I picked up ?.
|CAPCOM|Oh, I don't know, John says it blew up on his mission too guys.-
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I thought you were kidding.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, I'm sorry I thought that was -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17 and John says that it blew up on his mission as well.
|CERNAN| awayfromyou.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene one thing we'd like before you guys leave the ----- rov -
|SPEAKER|GARBLE
|CAPCOM|One thing we'd like before you guys leave the Rover is a fairly good description of what happened to the rear fender when it came off. Is the damage primarily to the piece that you've lost or the rails on the piece that's remaining fairly bad?-
|CERNAN| rail on the aft inboard side here - the rail isn t missing — it s just a piece of the flange - the rail that fits against the fender - but that doesn't hold any part of the fender on. I don't remember what I saw on the fender - the rails look pretty good, Bob. And I had one of them completely on and I just couldn t get the other one on. If I had known what that dust was I would have tried an awful lot harder.
|CAPCOM|Okay, do you have any feel on the
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Do you have any feeling that you could get away with putting a front fender on?
|CERNAN| e asy .
|CAPCOM|Okay, as far as you can tell so that we can look at it over night - the rear fender - the part that s remaining looks in fairly good shape, right?
|CERNAN| part you need I think to hold that fender on -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 02:00 CST, 123:25GET, 487/3

|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll have to get the contamination bags too the re .
|SCHMITT|Say that again Bob.
|CAPCOM|All right. We've got the contamination bags to get two out1of the MESA.
|SCHMITT|I've got them.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that.
|SCHMITT|I mentioned that earlier.
|CAPCOM|Sorry about that.
|SCHMITT|they're in there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, do you know when you're brushing the LCRU we'd like1the blanket left at 100 percent rather than 65 percent - we'd like them all left open and a little warm also.
|CERNAN| And it all looks pretty good. The breakers are open the crew power is off1Where do you want the TV camera? Do you want it tilted down and aft?

|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 124 hours 37 minutes The participants for the Change of Shift Press Briefing are now on their way to the briefing room in Building 1. That conference should begin shortly. Here in Mission Control, Flight Director Gene status - or Gene Kranz rather has gotten a status from his Flight Controllers on both vehicles, both Challenger and America and both spacecraft appear to be in very good shape at this time. Aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt will now be involved in getting out of their space suits, getting the spacecraft cleaned up, ready for their sleep period and we expect to debrief them on the first EVA in about 15 minutes. Ron Evans now entering his scheduled rest period. America in the 19th revolution of th = Moon at the present time. And, during our change of shift briefing, we'll be recording any conversation with the crew on the lunar surface for playback immediately following that briefing. At 12 4 hours 38 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Hello, Houston, it's CDR with recharge of 93 percent.
|CAPCOM|Sounds good Geno.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 4 hours 44 minutes. Our post EVA press briefing is ready to begin at this time, so we'll switch to the MSC News Center Briefing Room.

125:10:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 125 hours 10 minutes. Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan aboard Challenger on the lunar surface have been involved in getting the portable life support systems recharged for tomorrow's EVA. And we're planning to debrief them on the first EVA shortly. They are then scheduled to continue getting the LM cabin configured for sleep and they have some time set aside to eat and we hope to get them into their sleep period at the time called for in the flight plan, which is a littles less than three hours from now. During the change of shift and we accumulated a small amount of taped conversation with the crew. We'll play that back now and continue to stand by live.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston, OPS pressure LMP 6100 and CDR 5900 .
|CAPCOM|Thank you, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we're changing a cartridge out in my PLSS. We've got the batteries changed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene-o, thank you.
|CHALLENGER|You don't have a cold something or othe r, do you?
|CAPCOM|I'm sorry you even mentioned it.
|CHALLENGER|We can think about it, can't we.
|CAPCOM|Mercy yes.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, does Captain America know all about this?
|CHALLENGER|Roger, Jack, he does. He's been fully advised and his response is - he's sound asleep n ow .
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I forgot, he was going to bed before we'did today.
|CHALLENGER|Did he have a good day up there?
|CAPCOM|He surely did. Fine day. And I want to make the observation, as a casual bystander, it was a real pleasure to watch your EVA unfold down here.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you, Joe. I think you are more than a casual bystander though.
|CHALLENGER|Hey Joe, we've got - one and three - correction, one is replacing the three and two is replacing the fours on the PLSS.
|CAPCOM|We copy.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we're in the right hand column of 3-3 n ow .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|That completes our tape playback. We'll stand by live now.

|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 02:20 CST 125:26 GET MC-495/1
125:26:00|PAO|This i £i Apollo Control, Gene Cernan's report that he was disconnecting his biomedical harness tells us that he and Jack Schmitt are in the process of getting out of their pressure suits, and that puts them about 25 minutes behind the Flight Plan Timeline. However, there is a fair amount of pad built into the Flight Plan during this period, up through the eat period and beginning with their sleep period, and we'do expect to get them to bed on time. We also earlier, got a report from them on weights — sample weights in sample collection bag number 2 and also in the sample return container, the rock box that was brought back aboard the lunar module. They reported 16 pounds for the sample collection bag, 32 pounds for the rock box. These are the gross weights, and we'll be coming up with net weights based on the estimated weight of the containers and other equipment. They are usually packing equipment stowed on the rock boxes. As soon as; we have a net weight for the samples we'll be passing that along. The next activity scheduled in the Flight Plan is the EVA debriefing and we expect that that will be occuring in the next 30 to 45 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 02:37 CST 125:44 GET MC-496/1
125:44:00|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger, we'll both be off the air briefly here as we swing into getting our suits and LCGs off. The commander presently has his suit off, and I'll start on mine.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It now appears that the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan will be ready to begin the EVA debriefing in about 20 minutes. We're estimating that they'll reach that point in the Flight Plan at about 126 hours 10 minutes. And, the debriefing will run 15 to 20 minutes. Ron Evans aboard America has been asleep now for about an hour and a half. We'll be waking him up at the ground elapsed time of 131 hours 20 minutes after about 8 hours of rest. America is presently in an orbit of 69.9 by 53.5 nautical miles, on the backside of the Moon in its 19th revolution, just about to cross over to the 20th revolution the beginning the 20th revolution, and we'll be reacquiring contact with that spacecraft in about 30 minutes.
|CHALLENGER|Hello Jo, you there.
|CAPCOM|Waiting patiently.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, if you're keeping score on the bottom of 3-4, we're both out of our suits, and does that feel good.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'm out of my LCG if you want to turn the page.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, and how are your hands feeling?
|CHALLENGER|Oh, they're a little tired on both sides here.
|CAPCOM|Can't imagine -
|CHALLENGER|But I think they'll pull through.
|CHALLENGER|Do I read this that the LMP sleeps on bio tonight, is that right?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. Rog, that's affirm.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, so I can take mine off, my sensors?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, Gene.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Well, we'll - we'll be up to the EVA debrief ing time here very shortly.
|CAPCOM|Rog.

126:12:00|CHALLENGER|Joe, do you know how much time has elapsed since we initially charged our PLSS's with 02?
|CAPCOM|Geno, it's time to charge them again, if you want to.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I just might pick that up.
|CAPCOM|All righty.
|CHALLENGER|We'll let you know where we are though.
|CHALLENGER|Say, Joe, I guess the home front was prob ably listening in - any one talked to them?
|CAPCOM|Haven't talked to them today, Geno. I haven't at le as t.
|CHALLENGER|Hello, boss, how are you doing down there?
|CAPCOM|Just, fine. Waiting for you guys to go to sleep so we can do the same. Had a great day up there guys.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, you don't have to wait for that. We're - ah it was super from here - quite an experience, Deke, and quite a challenge.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, it looked beautiful from here.
|CHALLENGER|I tell you it makes you feel like you had a good days work behind you though.
|CAPCOM|I can believe that.
|CAPCOM|We're about to give you the rest of the day of f, Gene.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you, Joe.
|CAPCOM|Geno - while you -
|CHALLENGER|Hey it's 3 o'clock in the -
|CAPCOM|Say again. XHALLENGER1I was just going to say it's 3 o'clock in the morning back there.
|CAPCOM|We know it.
|CAPCOM|It's 3 o'clock in the morning up there too.
|CHALLENGER|And we know that too.
|CAPCOM|Troops while you're in a listening mood up there we're going to be coming at you with a number of items here - not too many - but the first will be some surface block data. Then we're going to read up to you a LEVA cleaning procedure which is fairly simple, a real short geology debrief, one line change in the lunar surface checklist and then we've been doing some thinking down here about how to fix the fender, and it's going to involve, we think, although we'll work on it while you guys are getting some rest, it's going to involve using utility clamps from inside your LM there instead of tape to fasten some sort of stiff material onto the rover in place of the missing fender. And what will go either with one of your — your cue cards or possibly with part of insulation that with the flame blanket protecting the rover during the landing or perhaps part of the packing material that was between the rover wheel and is probably lying on the ground underneath the LM there.

126:24:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, you can go ahead and fire away at the LMP.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and for the geology questions, I'm going to turn the console over to the well known geologists of the seifort galaxies.
|CHALLENGER|Can't hack it, huh? you've all forgotten everything I taught you.
|CAPCOM|I draw my sword.
|CAPCOM|Okay guys, you want me to address first those to Gene - those to Jack and then address them to Gene later on or you guys both want to answer them at the same time?
|CHALLENGER|Well, we're both listening. We can answer them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the way you asked that, I wasn't s ure .
|CAPCOM|Okay. Question number 1 is - concerns the rover mobility rate. The rover mobility rates over the short spans you drove, which is hardly representative, are slower than people had anticipated. Do you think this is due to visibility, terrain, or what? Do you think you can still hack at 7.3 or 8 kilometer minimum or average to station 2 tomorrow?
|CHALLENGER|The answer to that is yes, Bob. I think it's partly - partly fam but it's also the fact that we'did a lot of circling. we'didn't drive in many straight lines. Trying to find, for the most part, our bearings and tried to pick some high spots so we could look around. So I think straight line navigation out in the area we're going is going to be easily 8 kilometers.
|CAPCOM|Okay, great.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Another question here, Gene, that you should be able to answer with a simple yes or no. Was there any spillage of the material in the drill core while you were breaking it down?
|CHALLENGER|Simple no.
|CAPCOM|Okay. An d -
|CHALLENGER|Spillage out of it?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, you know, when you broke the sections did you lose much material out of it.
|CHALLENGER|No sir, I didn't lose any.
|CAPCOM|Okay, next simple question. In the - when you were drilling the deep core where the neutron probe was, could you see the RTG over the rock?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 03:18 CST 126:24 GET MC498/2
126:24:00|CAPCOM|Okay. You have any feel for how high , the rock is or how low - how deep the thing was in respect to the - with respect to the RTG? Where you down in a level that was below even without the rocks being there?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I think I - yeah, I was in a - in a slump. There was a ridge between us and the RTG and I had the rock in a line of sight between it and where I put that core. And I'll say the rock was certainly near the ridge and it was - what, Jack? — I don't know was it meter to - meter high for the most part. And it sloped off and I' d say at least a half a meter high in the line of sight from where the neutron probe is to the - to the RTG. There's a lot of undulation - I think it'll be on the line of sight anyway.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And a somewhat more general question, here. It says - and I'll read it. We're still puzzled as to whether there is a dark mantle. Could yon say something more about the dark regolith surface? There's a lot of discussion today about whether or not it could have been a regolith derived from the intermediate gabbro from which you were sampling as boulders.
|CHALLENGER|Bob, I - I think I don't have to much to add to what I said near the end of the EVA, is that I do not have an intuitive feeling that the regolith has been derived from most of the boulders we're seeing. But, because those boulders are fairly light colored. They look like they're probably 50 percent plagioclase. The - it could be that the regolith is derived from some other material that is blank at the area. I don't think we have that answer, yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I copy that.
|CHALLENGER|Bob, the boulders - the boulders we are sampling - I think Jack and I both feel that it's probably -we feel we sampled the sub-floor because we saw on the sides of the craters where some of these boulders were exposed almost as if it were bedrock down there. In driving back from what we callrd station 1 we - we could definitely see the light mantle out in the area where the potentials of the slide are.
|CAPCOM|Okay, very good. Yeah, I think that the - at least it's a going bet around here that we're sampling the sub-floor when we're sampling, at least the top of the sub-floor when we're sampling the intermediate gabbro there. The rocks and the boulders.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We also -
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, the - APCLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 03:18 CST 126:24 GET MC498/3
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Bob.
|CAPCOM|Go.
|CHALLENGER|It is sort of strange that we'don't see a good population of fine - of finer grain rocks. These rocks look very much like igneous rocks but they're considerably coarser than comparable - well, they're about the grain size of some of the coarse grain mare basalt that tend to differentiate the crystodalite and tridimite but we'didn't see any of the finer grain versions. If it's an intermediate crystalline rock we have not seen any fine grain equivalents yet. At least not in abundance.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|CAPCOM|We get - we gather that there's no color change in the dark mantle material at depth. In other words the footprint, wheel tracks, and the rate sample, etc. was sort of uniform in color.
|CHALLENGER|No, there's no major change but looking out the window and I think I commented on it, the disturbed regolith is darker. Oh, I don't know, maybe by 10 percent albedo, something like that, than the undisturbed surface.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I remember your commenting that when you were walking to the ALSEP, I think, Jack, in fact.
|CAPCOM|Okay, during drilling of the Heat Flow holes, Gene,-
|CHALLENGER|That's right.
|CAPCOM|Was there change in color of the cuttings as they piled up - as you went down in depth? Do you remember any of that?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, Bob, both in the core and the heat flow holes it really didn't - didn't seem to pile it up like you're accustomed to it at the Cape and I guess maybe that's because I was kicking so much dust around there. But I looked specifically when I cleared flutes and what have you and I didn't see any difference in terms of color, texture or anything else coining up.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CAPCOM|On the outcrops you think you see in the North and South Massif. They appear to be linear horizontal or sub-horizontal,. Can you see layers and do you have any feel for the thickness or the attitude or the continuity of them? Can you discuss these outcrops?
|CHALLENGER|Bob, the - going over yesterday I thought I could see a structure dipping off to the southeast, apparent dip anyway, on the eastern side of the South Massif. Or
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 03:18 CST 126:24 GET MC498/4
126:24:00|CHALLENGER|north eastern side. We haven't examined them in detail because we were in a rush to get out. We'll put the binoculars on them and try to examine that question. There's nothing very obvious any more than you can see on the photos that the ledges were concentrated in the upper portion - excuse me - in the upper portion of the Massif units .
|CAPCOM|Okay. We copy that.
|CAPCOM|Here's a short one that I'll ask Jack since he did it. Again I guess we'll have to prove this -the shaded portion of the cosmic ray experiment. The question is and I repeat - I quote - "Are you sure that the detectors, not the decals were facing out?"
|CHALLENGER|I am, Bob, because I said I was sure and I called you on it.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I was sure too, but I had to ask the question.
|CHALLENGER|I - I under — I know I understand why it was asked because I did it wrong at the Cape. But that's why - that's why I mentioned it when I deployed it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|And ready to - Okay, and we can go and recharge the other PLSS whenever you're ready there, guys.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the next question, which calls for a little bit of discussion is - the layers of lineaments you remarked on in the Sculptured Hills -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 03:29 CST 126:35 GET MC-499/1
126:35:00|CAPCOM|Okay, the next question which calls for a little bit of discussion is: The layers of liminents that you remarked on in the Sculptured Hills, can you say anything about them ?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I think I did, I think I said - I commented, I'm not sure whether it was the Sun angle or not but see, I was not looking at the Sculptured Hills I was looking back at Bear Mountain, I believe. And, to me it looked like there was some organization that was dipping back to the East somewhere between oh 20 and 25 degrees maybe; and it was very obvious to me, but I'm a little - a little hesitant because of some of this Sun angle stuff.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. I gather we'didn't get any 500 millimeters of these lineations, is that right?
|CHALLENGER|No, but I think we will. I - they were on the western side of Bear Mountain back there, and I think I commented that I thought that Bear Mountain is probably what the Sculptured Hills look like.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. Is there a scap above the light mantle material. In other words the slide, is there a scap above that on the South Massif, can you see anything up there to indicate that it might have come off of there.
|CHALLENGER|Nothing obvious yet Bob,
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that. On the way back to Station I, you described a small crater with light material on the bottom, can you say anything more about that crater?
|CHALLENGER|Bob, I don't remember saying that, and Gene doesn't ei ther .
|CAPCOM|Okay. You talked about something that was light I don't remember - I thought it was a boulder, but the question's ab out a crater.
|CHALLENGER|You're right. You're right, there was a large zap pit in a boulder that was very white. It must have been - the crater for the zap must have been 2 centimeter anyway, and it had about that or maybe 3 centimeters worth of crushed minerals around it that gave it a white, very bright light appearance.
|CAPCOM|Okay well that was indeed a small crater, so I guess the question was right.
|CAPCOM|Let me change the mode here and ask you 3 or 4 simple ALSEP questions again to verify for various people exactly what happened just to make sure that they're clear on it. Jack when you were laying the geophone leads , you mentioned — you asked if it was all right if the geophone leads crossed one another, if there was EMI problems, and so that made people wonder whether or not it was possible the geophone positions were reversed, i.e. geophone 1 was laid out in geophone 2s' direction et cetera.
|CHALLENGER|No, that was just a geophone 4 problem. The geophones are in the right direction.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Geophone 4 fell out of the module and rolled
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 03:29 CST 126:35 GET MC-499/2
126:35:00|CHALLENGER|under one of the other lines or vice versa, I don't know which and it's crossing one of the other lines, geophone 1, I think.
|CAPCOM|Okay, no problem. Was the - when you went to put the LSPE antenna in the heat flow socket, you didn't have - -weren't able to do it at first, was it because of there was a lot of dust in there.
|CHALLENGER|No, I think it was the same old problem of that piece of - of aluminum foil or whatever it is going down in the socket and jamming briefly.
|CAPCOM|Okay I copy that. Did you clear out that foil when you did it, or did you just push it on through?
|CHALLENGER|I pushed it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. When you taped the SEP solar cells down, did you - how much of them did you cover with tape?
|CHALLENGER|We taped the back.
|CAPCOM|Ah, very good thinking. And Geno on a question for on the rover when you parked it, do you have any feeling for the roll angle it was parked at at the LM, the roll angle.
|CHALLENGER|Let me look. Bob, it's pretty flat, if I had to guess, I'd say zero, and you can bias that by a degree or so but basically zero.
|CAPCOM|Okay, is the pitch scale on it, or did it fall off yet?
|CHALLENGER|Now, I was going to comment on tha4" , it's still there.
|CAPCOM|Okay very good. Okay when you went to Sta tion I-A, we're calling the new station, Station 1-A, were the blocks there as well filleted as those near the LM and the ALSEP, do they all look the same?
|CHALLENGER|Bob, they - all the boulders had filleting or to a slight degree, but not an extreme amount. 1 think it no more than what is being caused by tue redistribution of the darker fine grained regolith.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that -
|CHALLENGER|Bob, if had to -
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Bob if I had to answer that question I'd say yes. Yes that the base of the boulders are filleted about like they are over here, those would be my impressions.
|CAPCOM|All right. Is there any indication that the fillets are directional, in other words that the fillets are heavier on one side than the other?
|CHALLENGER|Bob, haven't noticed that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. Do you have the feeling that some boulders more -
|CHALLENGER|Well that's a good -
|CHALLENGER|- that's a good -
|CAPCOM|Roger, I agree with you.
|CHALLENGER|That's a good reminder, Bob.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 03:29 CST 126:35 GET MC-499/3
126:35:00|CAPCOM|Okay, do have any feeling that some boulders are more rounded than others? Apparently this looked this way in some of the TV pictures.
|CHALLENGER|Some of the big ones that are just barely exposed above the regolith looked quite well rounded. Most of those around the craters are sub-angulars. I think - I got the impression that it's just purely a function of how long the same material's been exposed; but some of the big boulders like the one out near the geophones is quite angular in part and quite rounded in other parts. It's quite variable.
|CAPCOM|Okay, do you want to say any more about that boulder? Did it seem to have more or less the same morphology in addition to the variation in vesicle size that the other rocks in the vicinity of the ALSEP and the other rocks out at Station I have?
|CHALLENGER|It's very comparable to the ones that we saw at Station I, as a matter of fact.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|CHALLENGER|Both types of rocks were there, both variations.
|CAPCOM|Do you have a feeling for where big blocks in the LM ALSE13 area came from? Do you think they were from Camelot, like I've been saying?
|CHALLENGER|Don't have an idea yet, I'm really not sure.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and as you drove along on the traverse from the sep to Station I does the size of the small craters with blocky rims vary? In other words what we are looking for here is the variation in the thickness of the dark mantle?
|CHALLENGER|I can't answer that one yet, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Let me sum up by saying, I guess as I indicated before, our best guess is that the vesicular crystalline rock probably gabbro, I think you've been calling intermediate basalt or gabbro forms at least the upper part of the sub-floor. I don't think we've been close enough to a large crater rim to say that it's a - what the deep sections of the sub-floor are formed, but we think that this intermediate gabbro vesicular rock, at least medium grained, perhaps coarse grained rock forms at least the upper layer of the sub-floor. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Bob, I think that's pretty safe, right now. I
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 9:34 GET 126:45 MC-500/1
126:45:00|SCHMITT|Yeah, Bob, I think that's pretty safe right now. Once again I'm surprised that it's as coarse as it is, that being the upper portion of a plane's unit.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN| tion 1, driving back from station 1, where we'diH some of our circling and what have you, we'didn't have time to get off, but we'did see down in the, I don't remember whether it was in the slopes of some craters, or down on the slope itself, but I'd say several meters down below the mantle where there was, what we almost agreed to, might be bedrock, at least, a deeper portion of the subfloor.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well, I think we'll get to it tomorrow. I think I might just give you a clue to our thinking for tomorrow, I don't think we've seen, or done anything to day that is going to make us change very much from the nominal station of - nominal EVA 2 plans. In fact we'didn't get the station - to the EVA 1 at the large boulders at Emory. It's probably going to mean that station 5 might be shifted a little bit to the boulders on Camelot, but the certain stations thrive on the subfloor, and also to station 10,it assumed a higher priority than it originally had. Other than that I don't think we'll see an awful lot of changes to EVA 2. Over.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. I think that's safe. I suppose somebody's thinking about the possibility of going down to Emory. Maybe you just said that. Going down to Emory late in EVA 3.
|CAPCOM|I think at the moment they're thinking primarily they're going to station 10, and not going to s tation 1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, I wrested control -
|SCHMITT|Some of your experts might think about -
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SCHMITT|Some of your experts might think about what they might expect to happen to put the regolith on a bigrain pyroclastic would look like.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|We'll tell them, I'll see you tomorrow guys .
|CERNAN| one question, Bob before you run off. Did the TGA perform okay, with the - with the camera on?
|CAPCOM|As far as I could tell, Gene, it did, matter of fact, I didn't see the Gravimeter people afterwards to talk to them. But as far as I could tell, it did. We had one funny reading back at the LM very early when it was on the ground, which I'm at a loss to understand right off. Other than that everything seems to have gone very well. The readings were quite uniform, in fact, but, that's what makes you think they went well .
|CERNAN| know it's a little change in my thinking. I'd like to leave
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 038:38 GET 126:45 MC500/2
126:45:00|CERNAN| it's a piece of cake to take off. It's very difficult to lean over that bar without loosing your balance and taking your readings and what have you. So if we can leave it on, it would be far better.
|SPEAKER|Roger. I was noticing that. And I also noticed you only three ball reading we got, was when it was on the ground.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Gene, and Jack, if you'll get Lunar Surface checklist to 3-5, I've got an easy change to read up t o you.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. After the line empty MTB as follows, change the first line which reads, B&W Mags Golf in forward RHFSC to read, B&W MAG Hotel, in LGC compartment. And then go on to the next column, which begins, stow in ETB, change the second line which reads, LMPs camera with B&W MAG Hotel to, LMPs camera with B&W MAG Golf, That's MAG G, ETB. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Got you. Hotel, stow it and go out with Golf.
|CAPCOM|That's got it. And I've got a LEVA cleaning procedure which maybe you could pencil in there, it's an easy 3-step procedure. And I'll go ahead and read it step by step here. Step number 1, is tap LEVA base to remove loose dust. Step number 2, reads, If excess dust still remains use a towel from the LM tissue dispenser, which has been wetted with water, and gently wipe the visor from the top to the bottom, that is in one direction. And fold this towel after each wiping to keep the contact surface clean. There's a note. Take care not to wet the inside of it, that is the concave surface of the gold visor. And the last step is, allow it to air dry. And that's it on the LEVA cle aning.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, we got that. The Commander's PLSS is at its final charge and we're in the process of working on the LMP's PLSS now.
|CHALLENGER|I guess thre's no way to verify how much water you've got in there except to go through the procedure.
|CAPCOM|That's right, Geno. And we think you fellow have earned a good meal now, and maybe you can take the rest of the day off.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe. Thank you.
|PAO|The CAPCOM during the EVA Geology de briefing was Astronaut Bob Parker, who was CAPCOM during the EVA. Joe Allen is now handling the CAPCOM duties once again.
|PAO|Ron Evans aboard America now has - APOLLO 16 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 03:47 GET 126:54 501/1
|PAO|Ron Evans, aboard America, now in his 20th revolution of the Moon, just passed over the landing site a few minutes ago, and appears to be sleeping soundly. Ron has been asleep for about 3 hours now. And telemetry data on America shows the vehicle to be functioning normally, as are all of the scientific instruments with a couple of relatively minor exceptions, the mapping camera has not been retracted, it is somewhat slow to retract the last few times that that maneuver was performed and the camera has been left in the extended position, which is in normal operating position for the mapping camera. And we expect, as you heard, CAPCOM Joe Allen advise the crew that Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt will begin eating shortly, and we hope to get them tucked in for bed by about 128:00 hours or about 1 hour f r o m n ow .
|CERNAN| on magazines. Mag bravo has 77 frames.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Mag hotel has 83 frames.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Jack, on you mag hotel, we showed you all the way up to 183 at one time on that. Did you miss the 1, this time?
|SCHMITT|I may have clipped it out, Joe, 183, yes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, yes, you did clip it out, clipped it out cleanly so, thanks for verifying that.
|SCHMITT|Joe, mag Romeo has 21 frames, and I took a few random, and probably not very good 500 millemeter of the north and south Massif,
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. Thank you.
|SCHMITT|And Joe, verify that you want mag Charlie substituted for Mag Bravo on the CDR's camera.
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|Don't get me wrong, I think it's a good idea, Joe. Don't let everybody work all night on that one.
|CAPCOM|Jack, I think the answer to that is yes, per the checklist, by the way. That's the way we show it in our checklist here.
|SCHMITT|Roger. We just have - probably have a bout 100 frames left on Bravo, but we'll just keep track of that .
|CAPCOM|Jack, it'll go out later on, that Bravo will - apparently, it's kind of your backup magazine there.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|The reason being, we want to start that EVA 2 with a fresh mag,
|SCHMITT|Hey, Joe. Bob told us earlier, the sounder looked like it was working.
|CAPCOM|Gene and Jack, just a general comment on that. SIM BAYS cooking along beautifully. We are getting
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 3:47 GET 126:54 501/2
126:54:00|CAPCOM|Lunar sounder data. It looks quite interesting. We've only got one or two annoying problems, but it's nothing major, that is with the Sim Bay, not with the sounder, one of them being that the usual mapping camera extend problem, and we've just decided to leave it extended and it will serve it right if it gets a little contaminated with an occasional dump. And I guess there's a minor problem with one of the big antennas. It didn't pass its retract test properly so I guess it may have to be jettisoned when we'do a plane change. Otherwise, things are working beautifully . Ove r.
|SCHMITT|that sounds great, I'm glad to hear that.

When last we had telemetry data on it. And, Ron Evans continuing to sleep soundly. He's been asleep now for about 3-1/2 hours. On the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard Challenger are eating at this time, and we hope to get them to bed by about 128 hours or about 27 minutes from now.

127:43:00|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|We're sort of around 2730 in the checklist more or less, and you want the power amps and PCF?
|CAPCOM|Ready when you are. And, troops, are you raiding the pantry up there yet?
|CHALLENGER|Yes, we are. We've been hitting it as hard as we can. Okay, power amp is going to primary and PCF to high. And, while we're waiting for Gene to look at his computer, should I do the battery menagement?
|CAPCOM|Jack, stand by until we get the high bit rate on that battery management. And, a reminder, are you recharging that PLSS number 2 there, or have you taken that off the line.
|CHALLENGER|No, we're through with that. We caught it with 10 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We've got high bit rate now. Go ahead with battery management.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'll play it — Gene'll work the com puter, and I'll work the batteries, and the ED volts are 37.2 both batteries.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you got POO in data, Joe.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, the battery management complete. How does the rest of the spacecraft look, what you can see of it?
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jackie. Copy that battery management complete and Challenger's looking beautiful from down here.
|CHALLENGER|I guess you don't have telemetry on dust yet, huh?
|CAPCOM|Negative on the dust. And the computer's yours. Sounds like you've got hay fever sensors, as far as that dust goe s.
|CHALLENGER|It's come on pretty bad just since I came back. I think as soon as the cabin filters most of this out that is in the air, I'll be all right, but I didn't know I had lunar dust hay fever.
|CAPCOM|It's funny they don't check for that. Maybe that's the trouble with the cheap noses, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Could be. I don't know why we couldn't have gone and smelled some dust in the LRL just to find out.
|CAPCOM|Goodness knows, we tried.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'll wait for your cue on the rest of it .
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. Telemetry PCM low and your power amp off, please.
|CHALLENGER|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, this is Houston requesting down voice backup, and then configure your ECS for sleep at your con-venien ce.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're working in that direction. Down voice backup now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 04:36 GET 127:43 MC503/2
127:43:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack and Gene, and, unless you've got questions or we can help you out in some way, we'll say goodnight to you,
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 7 hours 51 minutes. Cernan and Schmitt are now completing the items in the presleep che cklis t.
|CHALLENGER|The reason I say that, Joe, it's going to be another 30 minutes or so anyway before we -- probably more like an hour before we actually close our eyes.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. You think you'll be able to use about 30 more minutes of sleep tomorrow morning? What's your wish on that?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I'd like to try to get the full amount. As I recall, tomorrow's a little bit flexible; if we get up 30 minutes late, it doesn't really hurt us.
|CAPCOM|Sounds like a good way to proceed. We'll give you the full 8 hours. Goodnight, Geno. And, you do have a time pad in there, so it shouldn't hurt a thing.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah your big objective tomorrow is to get out and get back in, and the same thing with the next day. I don't think we're really that time critical either day that we can't go an hour either way. And, I think we'd prefer to have the full 8 tonight.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We couldn't agree with you more. And if there's anyway we can be of help to you now, just speak up.
|CHALLENGER|No, you've been doing fine. We just got a lit tle housecleaning we got to do that's going to take us — I expect we'll be an hour late, Joe.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 04:49 GET 12 7:56 504/1
0007:5:00|PAO|This Is Apollo control at 12 7 hours 58 minutes. And the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface are now getting configured to begin their sleep period. Among the things in the checklist that they have done is to turn off the power amplifier which accounts for the somewhat noisier communications that we're getting. This is a normal presleep configuration and we'don't expect to be communicating with the crew a great deal in the next hour and of course, none while they're in their sleep period. As you heard in the last exchange between capcom Joe Allen and Gene Cernan the crew will probably be getting the sleep period about one hour later than the flight plan calls for. At around 12 9 hours rather than the nominal flight plan time of 12 8 hours. We plan to allow them the full 8 hours for their rest period which means that they will be waking up just prior to 137 hours about 136 hours 55 minutes will be the wakeup time. And this would also slip the start of EVA-2 by about one hour giving us a start time for EVA—2 of 140 hours 10 minutes or about 5:03 p.m. central standard time. There is a one and a half hour pad following EVA-2 and EVA-3. This is identified in the flight plan as MCC conference and amounts to one and a half hours that can be used to make up loss time after the second EVA and third EVA. We would expect to make up the lost hour after the first EVA; however, if we are again running somewhat late after the second EVA rather and if we are running somewhat late after the second EVA we still have the hour and a half pad after the third EVA and would of course expect to be back on the nominal flight plan in time for an on time liftoff from the lunar surface. But, again based on the one hour late beginning of the sleep time and our plans to give the crew a full eight hours of sleep we would expect the EVA-2 to begin one hour late. At 140 hours 10 minutes or about 5:03 p.m. central standard time. We'll continue to leave the communication circuiPAO release Line up live untill it appears Cernan and Schmitt have begun their sleep period of actually gone to sleep. We'll be reacquiring the command module in about 21 minutes. That vehicle now on it's 21st revolution around the Moon. And Ron Evans now about four hours into his scheduled eight hour sleep period. At 128 hours 2 minutes, this is Apollo control, Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Joe.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Some ambiguity in your - say did you want us to use a tissue or a towel on that visor cleaning.
|CAPCOM|Jack they call it - they call It a towel but it comes from the LM tissue dispenser, so I would interpret that to mean tissue. APOLLO 17 MISS ION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 04 :49 GET 127:56 504/2
|CHALLENGER|Well, you and I are thinking alike, but can you ask back there and find out.
|CAPCOM|Asking right now.
|CAPCOM|Jack, our guess was right on the cleaning of the visor there. You're to use a tissue_fro. the LM tissue dispenser. And I've got an unrelated question for you. We re tracing vater usage down here. Could you te11 us, please, if you filled your drink dispenser - refilled the drink dispensers in the suit already, over.
|CHALLENGER|That's affirm, we have-
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CHALLENGER|We have been drinking quite a bi wa te r , Joe .
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 128:05 CST 04:58 MC505/1
128:05:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|You're loud and clear. Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, I just took a quick look with the hand lens at that large rock I brought in. And, I don't think there's much more than 30 per cent plagioclase. I'll go back to, could be more of a standard basalt or gabbro. It has a fair proportion of elbonite in it I believe. There're some bright whitelets in the rock's vesicles of elbonite. Now it could be if the file is very glassy that it's developed the darker color from the contribution of the basic minerals to the glass, particularly the iron and the titanium.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Copy that. Sounds interesting.
|CHALLENGER|All it means is that we'don't yet know the origin of the Dark Mantle.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|That rock looks like I may, by accident, sampled the bunt side of one of the parting plains that I mentioned. Very, very sharply bounded on one side by a plainer s urface.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Say again, you may have sam pled by accident the side of what?
|CHALLENGER|No, I didn't, I mentioned when I sampled it had one very plainer surface and looking at it more closely, it looks like one of those parting plains that I talked about even earlier in the EVA.
|CAPCOM|Oh, Roger. Copy. Parting plains.
|CHALLENGER|Just like parting shot.
|CAPCOM|Of which, you've been known to have an over abundance by the way.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, I didn't know that.
|CAPCOM|All us (garble, garble, garble).
|CHALLENGER|That's right. They've got to figure out what range you're in though first JOe.
|CAPCOM|I'm sure that Sherlock Holmes would have a suitable quotation to answer that Jack. I just can't come up with it right now. Something like therein walks in life.
|CHALLENGER|That in itself is a singular event. But the dog did nothing in the night time Joe.
|CAPCOM|And when you've examined all possibility and eliminated all but the very improbable one, then the improbable one must mean the truth.
|CHALLENGER|I told you he was a good geologist. One of the experts on the soils of London. Not to mention their relationship to all kinds of brands of tobacco.
|CAPCOM|Jack maybe we'd better get off onto another vein. Surgeon's giving me a puzzled look over here. We may
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 128:05 CST 14:58 MC505/2
128:05:00|CAPCOM|be getting in trouble.
|CHALLENGER|You want to talk about veins, now that's something that old ore geologist could talk about all night.
|CAPCOM|Ore geologists and cardiologist alike.
|CHALLENGER|Thou strikest for the juggler.
|CAPCOM|Jack, we're running a contest down here to come up with a reply to that. We're getting a request, many requests for a weather report. We've been missing your weather report. We wonder what the weather is on the Moon right now.
|CHALLENGER|Well, the Moon's weather is fair and sunny. It's only scattered clouds, and all of those seem to be attached to the Earth.
|CAPCOM|Except for a cloud of dust around the right rear wheel of the Rover, we've noticed.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, but that dissipates in the morning warmth. Believe it or not, Joe, I'm going to be off the air briefly.
|CAPCOM|So far, I don't believe that.
|CHALLENGER|Well, if you don't get any heartbeat for a little while, don't worry.
|CAPCOM|Okay.

128:17:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 128 hours 54 minutes. Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard Challenger on the lunar surface have turned off the voice subcarrier. we'don't expect to hear from them any further. However, we'do not believe at this time that they have begun their sleep period. Cernan reported about an hour ago that it didn't look as if would actually begin their sleep period until about 129 hours. So we expect that they are probably very close to beginning and will actually get to sleep within the next 10 or 15 minutes. Ron Evans aboard the Command Module crossed over the landing site some 10 or 15 minutes ago. America is now in it's 21st revolution of the Moon. And Evans has been sleeping soundly for nearly 5 hours. we'do plan to let Cernan and Schmitt sleep a full 8 hours which means that they will be getting up about an hour later than the flight plan time which will also slip the start of EVA 2 by about 1 hour. Because of the noise on the air-to-ground line with the lunar module operating with it's power amplifier OFF which is the normal configuration for sleep period. We are going to take the relief line down. We'll record any conversation we get with the crew. Also, we would have a pretty good chance of getting the lines up in the event they plan to give us a call because we'll see the voice subcarrier come on first. But in any event either live or play-back we'll come up very shortly after any conversations with Challenger on the lunar surface or America in orbit around the Moon.

128:30:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control with 129 hours 30 minutes. About 28 minutes we had one brief transmission from Challenger on the lunar surface. Gene Cernan called to say that he and Jack Schmitt were beginning their sleep period and would see us in the morning which will be at a ground elapsed time of 136 hours 55 minutes. We plan to give them the full 8 hour sleep period called for in the flight plan. Also, Ron Evans, continuing to sleep soundly aboard the orbiting command service module America, completing it's 21st revolution of the Moon. And we're about to lose radio contact with the command module as it goes behind the Moon on that revolution. Both vehicles continuing to perform normally and good solid data from both the command and service module and the lunar module. Wakeup time for Evans aboard America is 131 hours 20 minutes. 31 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston and we'll replay that very brief segment of tape from the lunar module Challenger.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we're asleep. There's no need to answer. See you in the morning.
|PAO|And that was the full extent of the communications from Challenger. we'do not expect to hear from them until 136 hours 55 minutes at which time we will be sending a wakeup call to them if they don't call us first. This is Mission Control Houston. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 130:30 CST 0723 MC 508/1
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 30 minutes. We've reacquired radio signals from the command module America now on it's 22nd revolution of the Moon, with Ron Evans aboard sleeping soundly. Ron has been asleep now for nearly 6 and a half hours and before we lose contact with America in a little over an hour, we'll be putting in a call to Evans, getting him started on his second day, alone in orbit around the Moon. On the lunar surface, aboard Challenger, Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan have been asleep now for about an hour and a half. They have some 6 and a half hours remaining in their sleep period and will be awakened at about 136 hours 55 minutes or about 1 hour later than called for in the flight plan which will give them the full 8 hour rest period. And we anticipate we'll also slip the start of the of this about 1 hour. Cernan and Schmitt could make up some of it in time by getting ahead of the timeline in their EVA preparations, but we anticipate that the EVA will slip by about 1 hour and there is an hour and a half pad following EVA 2, another hour and a half pad in the timeline following EVA 3. So, we anticipate no problem in making up the lost hour either after the second EVA or after the third EVA. And both vehicles, based on the telemetry data we're receiving here in Mission Control, are operating very smoothly. We'll be handing over the shift in Mission Control in the next 40 minutes or so but we'do not anticipate a change of shift press briefing. No change of shift press briefing following this shift change. At 130 hours 33 minutes this is Apollo Control Ho us t on.

Command Module America will reappear in the 23 revolution in about 38 seconds in which time there may or may not be some conversation between the spacecraft communicator, Gordon Fullerton and Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans. Evans, by now, should have completed his breakfast, change out of lithium hydroxide canisters in the spacecraft which scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Command Module America still in an orbit measuring 69 point 9 at ape-cynthion by 53 point 6 nautical mile pericynthion or close, closest approach to the surface. We have acquisition. Network always advises the flight director when the ground station has indeed locked up on the signal it takes a few seconds to get all of the lines squared away and the antenna pointed directly at the spacecraft. We'll bring up the air/ground 2 circuit at this time and eavesdrop on any conversation between the ground and Command Service Module, America. At 132:20 and standing by this is Apollo Control.

|SC|Hey, scrambled eggs and bacon, not bad at all.
|CAPCOM|Sounds better than what I had.
|SC|Yes, really, I'll bet. Want cocoa and orange juice a long with it? Even have 4 toasted bricks.
|CAPCOM|Very good.
|SC|Hey, Gordo, do you have any sort of - kind of ground truth wrapup of the EVA as far as the type of material they ran across down there and things like that?
|CAPCOM|Ron, I'm kinda personally on and off. Let me work on it, get a summary and I'll cotne back to you on that.
|SC|Okay, nothing elebrate but just a - you know -
|CAPCOM|Okay, talking about the America, though, your consumables, you're 3 point 8 per cent high on RCS quanity. On the 0 2 - well, all the points of the 3 tanks are falling between the 2 sets of lines on your graphs with a total results as on 0 2, you're about 10 pounds below the average quantity expected, however, your trend is paralleling in the lines and that's of absolutely no concern. On hydrogen, my best guess is you're probably a little bit high total. Your tank 1 is right on the line, tank 2 is, oh, about 6 or 7 percent high and tank 3 is about 4 percent high, so you're fat on hydrogen. Over.

|SC|Yeah, go ahead, Joe. Appreciate it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I'll read it to you - selected excerpts here. The surface around the landing site is generally an undulating plain which was somewhat rougher and had a greater abundance of blocks than was expected by the astronauts. It is saturated with small craters not exceeding a few centimeters in size, but not with larger craters. Small craters commonly have glass on their floors. Boulders ranging from about a half a meter to 4 meters are common. All of them are partially buried or filled with the dust of the dark mantle. In one locality a crater about 1 meter deep penetrated the relatively fine dark surface material, and excavated small blocks, other shallower craters in this area do not fully penetrate the mantle. This fact together with the abundance of small boulders on or near the surface indicate that the dark mantle is relatively thin. A minor amount of dust noticed upon landing, suggested a thin layer of fine grain unconsolidated material. Footprints and LRV tracks left firm impressions in the fine grain material when darker material was kicked up from underneath. At the ALSEP site, the drill encountered other materials several times and definately seemed to reach harder material at about a 7 foot depths. The deep drill core apparently also bottomed in harder material. In the core the material was noted to be cohesive and it contained more fragments than did the surfacial material. The dominant rock type between the LM and Steno Crater, is medium grained , vesicular or nonvesicular basalt or grabbro. It contains about equal amounts of plagioclase and peroxine along with less abundance

132:28:00|CAPCOM|opaque material. The guys took a total of well, they took a lot of pictures. I had 229 color and 197 black and white during EVA-1. And they got 17 samples in addition to the deep drill core. 3 were large unbagged rocks, and the total splitting the core extimated to weigh about 13 kilograms so far and they traveled about 3 kilometers in the Rover. As a summary conclusion, the observations made on the first EVA support the premission interpretation that at least the upper part of the subfloor materials consist of the basaltic lava flow. The overlying dark mantle may be part of the regular on-subfloor material but the possibility that it is an independant unit, remains open and will be tested by observations on second and third EVA's. Both dark mantle and upper subfloor units, contain remarkably little foreign material between the ALSEP site and Steno, which suggests comparatively young ages. Over.
|SC|Hey, that sounds like a good report there. They - sounds like they got a lot of stuff to edit. Also getting very good information out of it already.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I think that's a safe conclusion. Going to get a lot more today.
|SC|Oh, you bet.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 132:37 CST 0930 MC 513/1
132:37:00|CAPCOM|Ron, for your information, the ALSEP seems to be working pretty well at the central station and all experiments with the exception of one, are working normally. The one that's giving them trouble is the LEAM and the data on the LEAM doesn't seem to want to sync up properly. They're thinking that one over and maybe will have something for them to try to get that to work right. Over.
|EVANS|Oh, okay, mighty fine. . , i

132:47:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I have a couple of update flight plans to give you. We suggest you take them down before you start the P52, at your convenience. Just so we'don't interrupt your preparations for the zodiacal light.
|AMERICA|Okay. Got (garble) inspection of the camera, finally. Something about the zero G, it kind of pulls that crazy little cassette back out of the way again. I had a heck of a time getting the lid closed on that.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Okay, ready for the update.
|CAPCOM|Okay, your key star time for zodiacal light goes in there at 133:25 is 133:28:03.
|AMERICA|Key star 133:28:03.
|CAPCOM|That's correct, and then flip the page over to 134:35.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And write in charge battery A.
|AMERICA|Charge BAT A at 134:35.
|CAPCOM|Affirmative. At the bottom of the same column, at 134:54, delete mapping camera retract, and also a couple of lines later, delete mapping camera laser altimeter cover closed.
|AMERICA|Okay, we'deleted the retraction of mapping camera and also deleted covering - closing the mapping camera laser altimeter.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. Above that whole se quence, we have some verifies for you. You can write this in about 134:50. Actually, you'd better start a little higher to have room.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Verify all VHF off for sounder path and here are the steps. VHM AM A and B OFF. VHF AM Receive Only OFF. VHF Beacon OFF and VHF Ranging OFF. Four steps there, by the way .
|AMERICA|Okay. We just verify that all VHF is off for sounder operations. VHF A and B OFF, Receive OFF, Receive Only OFF, Beacon Off and Ranging Off.
|CAPCOM|Okay. That's all I've got.
|AMERICA|Ranging's Off, Beacon has been Off, Receive Only is OFF - Okay.

|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. You sound pretty good to me.
|AMERICA|Okay, I don't have this comm carrier on very tight. I just wanted to make sure I was still coming through all right.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I think it's perfectly adequate.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we'd like high gain to auto.
|AMERICA|High gain to auto. Have it.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Looks like another good one, Ron.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Those are good - talk 'em up.

|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Ron, just for general information, on your platform drift range, it's not to bad. X is minus point 007 degrees per hour and Y plus point 002 and Z is really hard to believe, it's a minus point 0003 degrees per hour.
|AMERICA|Ah ha, that's beautiful.
|CAPCOM|That's gotta be some kind of record.
|AMERICA|Oh, I guess.
|CAPCOM|We may just cancel all further P52s.
|AMERICA|(laughter) Yeah, they're kind of easy here in lunar orbit. All except that one that I didn't get done on time yesterday. By the time I got around to doing it I was pointing right at the Moon, bowl and ditch, it was daylight and I couldn't see any stars and finally got the right attitude so that pick a pair would work.

133:17:00|AMERICA|Well, Gordo, it looks like I'll lose you right in the middle of this zodiacal light sequencer.
|CAPCOM|That's right. We aren't going to be able to be much help. I'll give you a little warning before T start. But you're on you own after that, I guess.

|CAPCOM|Coming up on time to close the shutter n ow.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, America, we're just about LOS. I'll see you on the other side.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordo, thank you much.
|PAO|And we've had loss of signal as Apollo 17 command service module America coasted behind the Moon nearing the end of the 23rd lunar orbit. Present orbit measurements 53.5 nautical mile pericynthion by 69.6 apicynthion. Velocity at LOS was 5 365 feet per second. Ron Evans and spacecraft America will come back around on the 24th lunar orbit in1. approximately 48 minutes. The crew of Challenger, meanwhile, at Taurus-Littrow, are still asleep at this time. Wakeup time is now scheduled at ground elapsed time of 136:55, slightly over 3 hours from now and the new start time for EVA 2, as mentioned earlier, is ground elapsed time of 140 hours 10 minutes, and at 133 hours 33 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 10:34CST 133:41GET MC-519/1
133:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. A briefing on the modular integrated utility system - MIUS - sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics will take place momentarily in the small briefing room in the Building 1 news center. Still some 3 hours away from crew wake up, the surface crew, that is, of Cernan and Schmitt aboard the Lunar Module, Challenger - asleep at this time at Taurus-Littrow landing site. At 133:42 a reminder to news men of the briefing on the utility system program starting momentarily. This is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/12 GET 134:16 CST 11:09 MC 520/1
134:16:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours 16 minutes, ground elapsed time. Less than a minute now until Ron Evans aboard Spacecraft America appears on the front side of the Moon. The 24th revolution. We'll monitor any conversation between the ground and Evans during this front side pass, which lasts slightly over an hour. Evans at this time, conducting some of the orbital science and photography experiments and tasks. Waiting for the word from the network controller that the spacecraft has been acquired by the ground station. To repeat the earlier times for the day's activities with the crew of the Lunar Module Challenger, they will be wakened at ground elapsed time of 136 55. The start of EVA-2 is now scheduled at 140 10. We should have acquisition now. We're waiting for the antennas to settle down, spacecraft to get solid lockon. The static is dropped off considerably. We'll stand by while CAPCOM makes his call.
|CAPCOM|Hello, America.
|SC|Okay, you got America here. The dark light sequence worked real well. Oddly enough I ended up right. On the right setting with the right time and everything the only thing is on the 8 minute - on the 8 minute picture, for some reason I didn't notice that the shutter shut as soon as I took it instead of 60 seconds later so we just missed that picture altogether.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, understand.
|SC|But the timing worked out good. It was about 2 seconds after the 1450 sequence - no 2 seconds - no 1 second after the 1450 sequence, and the sun came up.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|It's going to be hard to - to determine any real relief around the vicinity of Sangor right in there, because it's right at the 0 facepoint now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Ron, I have some words on what we've been seeing in the sounder and optical recorders when you get a free momen t.
|SC|Okay. I'm just kind of looking out the win dow now, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. According to our rather crude readout on the film remaining is - looks like we're using more film than we should be, and the recorder and it's - if you add up the amount of film used according to that telemetry, compared to sometimes when the recorder has been ON and also at STANDBY. It looks like there's a possibility they jibed to show we might be pulling film through the recorder in - while we're in STANDBY. This is unlikely because it takes a couple of failures that we'don't think there really likely at all but we're going to try to run a little test at 134 50 during that sequence of getting set up for the VHF sounder pass. It'll just involve a couple of switch throwing
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 134:16 CST 11:09 MC 520/2
134:16:00|CAPCOM|by you to try to conclusively prove that this is not the case. Over.
|SC|Oh, okay, mighty fine. Sure when you get to it there, just holler out the switches because i'll be over at the panel at that time.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|I kind of hope our telemetry is wrong. \ .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 11:20 GET 134:27 MC-521/1
134:27:00|SC|Let's go to the - pan camera power on the re.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're ready.
|SC|Okay, boys, stand by, pan camera power's coming on.
|SC|You know, Houston, just west of (garble) and on the edge of -
|CAPCOM|We need the pan camera OFF now and -
|SC|Oh, okay, pan camera is OFF.
|CAPCOM|Roger, go ahead.
|SC|But you get the same verticle - you get the same verticle streaking that we'do on the edge of Serenitatis off the Massif units.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Going up on the card now, looking at it a little bit from a distance, there's a darker albedo that goes out about about a half a crater diameter from it and then on top of that darker albedo it only goes out maybe a fourth of a crater in diameter is a lighter type material that seems to be covering it up. The lighter type material, though, only goes in a generally westerly - well up from the south around to the west side and kind of from the northeast around to the northwest side and it leaves the dark material draping down in the side of Bicart, on the east side of B i cart.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It looks like it's fairly easy to, when you go around from the south to the west side it has a light material on it. You can pretty well carry a light layer in the top portion of the wall all the way around to that part where it stops, where the light part stops. And then you come to a dark layer again and then as you continue around from the west going around to the north side. It's a little bit shadowed on the east side so I can't tell for sure if that light layer is in there or not but starting on the south side going around to the west again you can see a layer of dark, dark material, although there doesn't seem to be a change in the slope or the interwall of the crater.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And then just below - just below the dark layer, again a change in slope a little bit, it's more of a gradual slope, it goes on down to essentially maintain that slope throughout the - all the way down to the crater . floor, where you get into the slope blocks and then in the center of the crater it looks like a maria type fill with -hey, I'm about to lose sight of it again - but, with something comparable to a central peak in it. I ought to get the rest of that a little bit later on.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 11:20 GET 134:27 MC-521/2
134:27:00|SC|You know, right west of, I think it's Yerkees or Yerks or whatever it is, between there and Frakalas, there's a real small crater, I'm looking at it with the binocks, and the reason it stands out is because it's a fresh crater and yet it's a dark, dark halo all the way around it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And it's also dark down on the inside of it. I still don't have a feeling for the relative size of things. I'll try to get that one in the next pass around through, but that's what I would call a small, maybe even in the thousand meter barcket probably, some where in there.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|Am I supposed to charge battery A here some where.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, when you've got a chance and also you're due to turn some switches on p ane1 2 30.
|SC|Okay. Let's see, battery vent valwe was still in vent and we're not tying together -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 134:37 CST 1130 MC 522/1
134:37:00|AMERICA|On vent, and we're not tied together. Bat relay bus to Bat A is out. Okay, got 32 volts, let's go to bat charger at A. Up two and a half 2.2 and a quarter Amp.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|And 34 volts on the charge. Okay, just where it gets interesting, though, I thought I had to go to 2:30, huh?
|CAPCOM|Right.
|AMERICA|Okay, let's - do you want to get that lunar sounder stuff now? Sounder on standby? Recorder is on. Radar is on. Recorder is off. Mode went to VHF.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds good.
|AMERICA|And all the VH - all the VH switch - VHF AM switches are verified off.
|CAPCOM|Oh, and I've got one more update for the flight plan unless there's something interesting out the window. There's no hurry on that update.
|AMERICA|Okay, let me take another look at the landing site then I'll get it, okay?
|CAPCOM|Okay, fine.
|AMERICA|Okay, the sun's getting a little bit higher now and as I look at the landing site, the albedo -differences in the color in there, the color in the Maraldi (garble) is the same as in the landing site itself and also looks like the type of material that we say is - especially covering that whole area. It goes on out to and includes the annulus of Serenitatis.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Let's see, did I mention that it looks like the flow out of Maraldi has gone on around it down to and almost encroaches on the Vitruvius A that has breached out of the side of Maraldi, gone around that depression there and up to the side of Vitrivius A.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|AMERICA|You still get that same bluish - bluish type tint from the area in the landing site. At station number 2 in the landslide, it's going to be a pretty good -pretty good little depression there. The scarp itself - it looked like they picked the least slope - portion to go up it, and that's kinda between Lara - I think Lara's the one, right - the crater just to the - west of the scarp.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I haven't been on all your revs, Have you ever had any - anything you call a visual on the left?
|AMERICA|No, I really haven't looked that much, Gordo. See my optics were always pointing up in the air, so I can't use the sextant. The binox - I'm having a heck of a time holding them still enough to concentrate on anything very small.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|You know, when you come around the dark annulus falling around by Menelaus and Tacquet and then it kinda seems to change color a little bit when you get up to a Sulpicius Gallus,
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 134:37 CST 1130 MC 522/2
134:37:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|I guess the only thing you can say is that the southern part in there - the Tacquet region, has more of a bluish tint and that to me this has more of a brownish tint to it when you get up in the Sulpicius Gallus region.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|AMERICA|Hey, wait a minute, I'm just now passing Menelaus now. So, it changes color right at the Tacquet and then, at about Tacquet and Menelaus, and Sulpicius Gallus is just now coming up. You know, I think sun angle has a heck of a lot to do with the fact because this whole thing of the Sulpicius Gallus region looks kind of brownish to me.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 11:40CST 134:47GET MC523/1
134:47:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|We'll have to check that when the sun gets a little bit higher as we come across there again.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordo, I guess I'd better get some work done here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I want you to go through all those switches as shown on the flight plan and when you finish all of those with SMC power off I have a couple of more for yo u.
|AMERICA|Okay. Forgot to turn the lights on in there though. I can't see in the dark. Okay, mapping camera - is that the right time - let's see - 49? Oh, wait just a second on the mapping camera there. It takes good terminator pictures too, doesn't it?
|CAPCOM|Ron, go ahead and turn the mapping camera off. Just a minute or two ago it started acting up. . We'll turn it off now and troubleshoot it later.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay. Happing camera's off right now. Take 30 seconds. - Okay, mapping camera is standby, image motion is off - Okay, there we go, standby - Now, image motion is off, got a barber pole grid, in grey, okay? Now, mapping camera to off, laser altimeter to off, - Okay, want the recorder to on, huh? All right, IR's going off and camera's off test, going off -
|CAPCOM|Wait until sunset on the next one.
|AMERICA|And the old - Okay. I can really tell sunset because the EVA pole sticks out here by window 5. It looks like it's lit up now the way the sun's shining on it.
|CAPCOM|Ro g ,
|AMERICA|Hey, Gordo, how good is that vox? Could you hear me chewing?
|CAPCOM|No, I can't hear you chewing. Hear you talking fine.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's good then.
|AMERICA|That has to be sunset.
|CAPCOM|It's about the right time.
|AMERICA|Okay. V is off and I'm going to close the IR cover, barber pole grey EV cover, barber pole and grey. - Okay, I'll turn the old flag power off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Now we want lunar sounder operate switch to operate.
|AMERICA|Okay, let's go to operate - ah - now.
|CAPCOM|What we're doing this for is to get a readout of the film quantity.
|AMERICA|Oh, I see.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got it and you can go back to your lunar sounder operate switch to standby now. \
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 134:57 CST 11:50 MC 524/1 
134:57:00|CAPCOM|Stand by now.
|AMERICA|Okay, lunar sounder is in stand by.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that completes that test. Have a couple of additions to the flight plan for 13635 is the first one.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 13635 add VERB 48; perenthesis 11102; perenthesis 01111.
|AMERICA|Okay, at 13635, VERB 48; 2, 1102 and 01111.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the first one is 3 ones 02.
|AMERICA|Okay, 3 ones 02, and a 0 4 ones.
|CAPCOM|Right. And what we're doing here is making a 20 degree roll by keeping P20 going to allow the CAL the VHF, I guess they had some unexpected noise on the VHF center and they want to slip this in as a another check on it. So the next step is 13644, and at that time put in VERB 22, NOUN 78, perenthesis plus 072.241perenthesis. Then VERB 58 ENTER then some words when maneuver complete wait 20 seconds. Then a VERB 22, NOUN 78, perenthesis plus 052.25 perenthesis. That's a plus 052.25. And follow that with a VERB 58 ENTER. And then one more line, you still with me?
|AMERICA|Yep, still with you, Gus.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 13647, write in VERB 48, and we go back to perenthesis 11101 and 0 and 41.
|AMERICA|Okay. At 44 we VERB 22978 then change it to 72.241degrees and VERB 58. Okay, and then we're going to stay in that attitude for 20 seconds. Then change it back to plus X, forward SIM bay attitude again. Then as soon as we get back we'll change our DAP back to 2 tenths of a degree per second.
|CAPCOM|That's right, and what this will do is stick the VHF antenna right straight down on Nadir for CAL.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay.
|CAPCOM|At your convenience, we need AUTO on the high gain.
|AMERICA|You have AUTO. Pretty convenient when your laying in the center couch. (chuckle).
|CAPCOM|Ron, I got the morning news if you understood and I can watch the clock there for the data system on-time, or off-time rather.
|AMERICA|Okay, sure, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay,
|AMERICA|I'm setting up the camera.
|CAPCOM|Front pages around the country are headlining last night's EVA as you might expect, with photographs taken from TV monitors showing Cernan and Schmitt doing their tasks. And by the way, their TV camera is spectacularly clear and sharp. It's almost like regular studio TV. In other news, South Viet Nam's President Thieu is
|AMERICA|Outstanding.
|CAPCOM|suggested all prisoners of war be released before Christmas.' He's also asked that all Vietnamese parties
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 134:57 CST 11:50 MC 524/2
134:57:00|CAPCOM|be included in peace negotiations. South Viet Nam and the Viet Cong are not directly represented in the secret talks now under way in Paris. Meanwhile, Henry Kissinger met for more than 4 hours yesterday with Hanoi representatives Le Due Tho. The two negotiators are expected to meet again this afternoon. Former President Harry Truman is still resting quietly although his condition remains serious according to his doctors. American poet Mark Van Doren died at the age of 78. He was a professor of literature in Columbia, and the winner of the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for his poetry. President Nixon announced yesterday he wants to extend wage-price control beyond the scheduled April 30 expiration. He also plans to freeze new hiring promotions for pay increases for executives of the Federal Government. Guess that doesn't include us. The Republican National Committee -

Currently Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans, Is doing a bit of housekeeping, said he was consolidating his trash. Also, he was passed the word just before LOS that the lunar sounder experiment which previously had been acting up a little bit is now feeding constant good data and working properly. However, there seems to be some apparent problem in the mapping camera which the people on the ground will discuss and come up with a troubleshooting procedure. They're not too certain, yet, just what the nature of the problem is. That will be reported as soon as some determination is made. 1 hour and 22 minutes until wakeup of the Challenger crew. And at 135:33 ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 136:15 CST 1308 MC 527
136:15:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 136 hours 15 minutes ground elapsed time, less than a minute away from acquisition of the command module America, coming around on revolution number 25 and 39 minutes approximately until the wakeup call to the crew of Challenger on the lunar surface, still asleep at this time apparently. The commander in the upper berth, and the lunar module pilot in the lower berth. Prior to the time the wakeup call is made, we will drop the Air/Ground 2 circuit carrying the command module pilot conversation and go to the Air/Ground 1 with the surface crew and their preparations for the second EVA which will start about an hour later than the premission flight plan. We have notification from the network controller that we have acquisition of the command module downlink. A visitor today in the Control Room is General James McDevitt, former Apollo spacecraft office program manager here at the Manned Spacecraft Center, now with a utility company in Michigan. We will stand by now for the initial call to the command module on this revolution.
|CAPCOM|Houston, over.
|AMERICA|Hello Houston, this is America, loud and clear.
|CAPCOM|You, too.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 13:19CST 136:26GET MC528/1
136:26:00|AMERICA|Houston, America. Magazine Lema Lema will be starting with frame 54.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that, Ron. The sounder still looks good, clicking right away and - the mapping camera is funny I mentioned earlier. We haven't nailed down exactly it is. Most likely we think it's an instrumentation erroneous indication and so we're going to continue with a normal schedule of activities in the mapping camera except, of course, for the deploy and retraction.
|AMERICA|Uh, huh - okay. Well, let's hope that's what it is then.
|CAPCOM|Let's.
|AMERICA|I'll have to change that. I'm starting at frame 55 instead of 54. I just took a picture of the crater on the - well, I guess southwest of Krisha{?).
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|AMERICA|It's got a light color - light colored dike or something through the central peak in the bottom of the small crater. The crater's about - oh - 30 to 50 kilometers, I guess, in diameter. There's a small crater west of Condoreet.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Another crater appears - it's got that same dark halo around it's crater and it extends out to -again you can see it real well out to about a half a crater diameter. You don't see any of the light colored except on top of it though like you do on the colored.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 13:30 CST 136:37 GET MC529/1
136:37:00|AMERICA|Boy, that scarp sure looks like a flow battery to me.
|CAPCOM|Rog. On the landing site scarp.
|AMERICA|Yeah.
|AMERICA|I don't know how you get it to go up the North Massif but it sure looks like it runs that way. Just from the shadows and everything.
|AMERICA|Gordo, does this go all the way out to Bessel? Across the Anulus ridge there?
|CAPCOM|It doesn't go all the way to Bessel. It . . stops up short of Bessel about half way across Serenity from the Taurus-Littrow to Bessel.
|AMERICA|Okay. I forgot to look where it stopped.
|AMERICA|They ended up on frame 92.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. Frame 92.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, high-gain to AUTO when you get a chance.
|AMERICA|Okay. There's 20 seconds or so.

136:47:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 136:54 GET. We have now shifted over to air-ground 1 for the first wake—up call to the crew of Challenger at the landing site, Taurus-Littrow. We have dropped the command service module circuit air-ground 2. Live and listening on the lunar module circuit at 136:54 this is Apollo Control.
|CAPCOM|Music ... Good morning, Challenger.
|CHALLENGER|Sounded like Parker has the duty. Both monumental and epic.
|CAPCOM|Jack, that's suppose to take you back to Cal Tech's final's week.
|CHALLENGER|(Schmitt humming the Funeral March)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 13:50 GET 136:57 531/1
136:57:00|CHALLENGER|How does everything look, Gordie?
|CAPCOM|Couldn't look better, how's it look to you?
|CHALLENGER|Well, it's nice to have rested so -
|CAPCOM|Roger, I'm sure of that.
|CHALLENGER|How do our consummables look today?
|CAPCOM|They look good as expected, right on.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The wakeup music this morning for Challenger was the "Ride of Valkyries" from Richard Wagoner's Opera Die Walkure. Apparently, Jack Schmitt, when he was at Cal Tech had his roommates sitting bolt upright in bed in the morning by playing this on the stereo system, and this was the appropriate choice of music for waking him up this morning. Thirty minutes from -
|CHALLENGER|Stowing your sleep restraint up there?
|CHALLENGER|I mean your hammock.
|CHALLENGER|Either way, I'll stuff mine - I'll stuff all of mine into this compartment here, if you're going to get yours, otherwise we could rearrange it. See how it looks first.
|CHALLENGER|(garble)
|CHALLENGER|Gordie, you guys held comm pretty well last night, and I only remember one break.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Take you off biomed for a minute.
|CHALLENGER|(garbled)
|CHALLENGER|Well, how about it Gordie, are we stay or no stay for EVA 2 prep?
|CAPCOM|You're stay, never any doubt.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you sir.
|CHALLENGER|Did you have any medication?
|CHALLENGER|I already reported the food. Hey, Gordie, status report is excellent, no medication for either one of us. CDR slept 6 hours pretty good, I slept 6 hours intermittent, but generally good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|And we've eaten well, I think. The food is a little bit confused since we had our little minor explosion in the cabin, but I think you could say it's good -we've had a lot to drink — a lot of juices, we ate the frank— furters. We're sharing a lot of the stuff cause it's not symmetrically packed. If you want more details it will take time.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 14:00 CST, 137:07 GET, 532/1
137:07:00|CHALLENGER|And Gordy we'did not eat the corn chowder.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Roger you did not eat the corn chowder. But most everything else on the menu, is that right?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah we got just about everything else. We got into maybe fixed up through 2 meals but essentially Meal B and C for yesterday were eaten except for the corn ch owde r .
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We're wondering if you could come up with a quantitative estimate on water you've each drunk and also your PRD readings.
|CHALLENGER|Stand by Gordy. That may be difficult. Yeah, we'll get the PRD a little bit later when we start suiting up.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, okay. That'll be fine.
|CHALLENGER|Hey Gordy, I'm in water. We saturated our selves before we went out. I finished my drink bag out in the suit on the surface. Jack finished about better than three quarters of his. We've had water in tea and in the juice and we have been drinking water constantly post-EVA, and to give you a quantity it's almost impossible.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's fine.
|CHALLENGER|If the water is down it's probably because we've been drinking it. And I'm ready for your lift-off pad data.
|CAPCOM|Okay, for REV 26 liftoff time is 138 40 15. 27 is 140 38 49. 142 37 22, 144, 35, 55, 146 34 29, 148 33 03. 1And the last one REV 32 is 150 31 37. Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, REV 26 - is that the first one, Gordy?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, REV 26 is 138 40 15; 140 38 49; 142 37 22, 144 35 55, 146 34 29, 148 33 03; 150 31 37. And what's our present REV?
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll have to check that my self. We're on REV 25, he's about three-quarters away across the Sun side. Coming up backside will start at 26. And for your information, he's running a VHF sounder and it's working fine.
|CHALLENGER|That's good to hear. By the way, good morn ing Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Good morning Commander.
|CHALLENGER|How does America, itself look?
|CAPCOM|Just as good as ever. I had on the con sumables no problem on the spacecraft systems - only minor funnies in the SIMBAY but even it is almost 100 percent.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and I guess — I didn't hear your comment but I guess Challenger is the same way.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. That's the way it looks here, anyway.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. We've been working while you've been sleeping on a fix for the missing fender. John Young has been over working it out in his suit in the mock up rover and we have about probably 5 to 10 minutes worth of words. And how do you want to go about that whenever you have that much time to listen. It'll be mostly listening on your part - let us know,
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 14:00 CST, 137:07 GET, 532/2
137:07:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy will do.
|CHALLENGER|Nope - well, I did but GARBLE.
|CHALLENGER|GARBLE.
|CHALLENGER|GARBLE.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, you've implied that we may be a little behind on water, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|No, that's not the problem, Jack. I think our concern was more that you were taking that from GARBLE onboard internally.
|CHALLENGER|Our water.
|CAPCOM|That's right - you were drinking enough - that's what we were worried about.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'll keep pushing it.
|CHALLENGER|GARBLE
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 14:10 CST 137:17 GET MC-533/1
137:17:00|CHALLENGER|Oh a -
|CHALLENGER|Cold scrambled eggs.
|CHALLENGER|(garble)
|CHALLENGER|Gordy we're going to start to eat here, why don't you talk to us about that fender?
|CAPCOM|Okay, let me round up John Young, he stepped out for a second. We'll have him here in a minute. Might as well let the resident expert on fenders talk.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll now turn the microphone over to Captain Young.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Geno this is John. We spent -
|CHALLENGER|Hello John, how you doing?
|CAPCOM|Oh just fine, you guys are doing a superb job, really beautiful. Hey we spent some time on this fender problem and worked out a pretty simple minded procedure which involves essentially taking 4 of those chronopaque pages out of your lunar surface map, ones which are not going to be used for discussing the site, taping them together with grey tape so that you end up with a piece of paper about 15 inches by 10 1/2 inches and then using the AOT clamps prepositioned pull opened, taking them out and taking that piece of paper out laying it on top of the fender guide rails and clamping the edges of it with the AOT lamp clamps. It's simple straight forward and the beauty of it you're only spending about 2 minutes in the clamping operation and it could save you up to about 12 dusting I think maybe. What do you think?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, John, I think we ought to try something because, you told me, but I guess you can't appreciate it until you see it happen yourself. That dust without that fender is just almost unacceptable it - This sounds pretty good, how do you want those things taped together?
|CAPCOM|You just take 4 pages and allow, well I've got the detailed procedures here if you're ready to copy, over.
|CHALLENGER|Well, I'm not ready to copy yet, but what do you do, tape 4 squares into a bigger square about 16 by 20.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, allow about an inch of overlap and tape both sides of them.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And then you get the AOT clamps off the utility light and open the clamp jaws to match, and you stow the clamps and you roll up the paper - roll up the - roll up your fender short-wise and put a grey tab over that and stow it in ETB you got both the clamps and the paper in ETB and then when you get out to the rover, you lay the edge of your fender over the inboard guide rail and clamp it and then you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard rail and clamp it, and the only thing your really have to worry about Is making sure that the inboard clamp is right over the shock strut so that you don't get any interference with the LRV structure when you turn the wheel.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, that's the type of thing I was going to ask about some of those subtle points. There really should
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 14:10 CST 137:17 GET MC-533/2
137:17:00|CHALLENGER|be quite a ways - well I'll look at it but almost vertical over the hub right?
|CAPCOM|Yeah. On the inboard one. On the outboard one if you put it a little further back aft on the wheel, it allows you to - it allows you to give your paper fender a little more rigidity.
|CHALLENGER|And you just say lay them over the guide rails, so the clamps are also over the guide rails, they're not trying and line that - the makeshift fender in the guide rails itself, huh?
|CAPCOM|No, it - just clamp the thing right to the rails, just allow a little overlap and clamp that rascal right down. And I know you can tighten those clamps down so good, it'll never get loose. I know you can do it if I can do It.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, John, I think I know what you're talking about, and I'd sure like to give it a stab. The only hooker i&lt;= I hope that tape holds the fenders together well enough.
|CAPCOM|Yeah they -
|CHALLENGER|- the pieces together well enough.
|CAPCOM|Roger. One of the things - when you're taping the pages together, that you want to be careful of is that you make sure and get the air bubbles out so when you get in the vacuum, it doesn't open up by itself. And maybe you can put an X across there to make sure that you - if you get any separation that's it's still held together pretty good. We think the tape will work -
|CHALLENGER|Okay -
|CAPCOM|- think the tape will work because (garble) in 13 we were using it just sort of incidentally in the thermal vacuum chamber and it worked okay there, for some reason.
|CHALLENGER|It would seem to stick on the surface okay if could find a dust free spot, when I put that other fender on earlier.
|CAPCOM|Yeah agreed.
|CHALLENGER|As far as how much of the new fender to overlap on the present fender, just make it about symmetrical with the other side, and probably ought to give me plenty of overlap, huh?
|CAPCOM|Well, are you talking about over the dovetail part of it, or are talking off the aft end of the vehicle?
|CHALLENGER|I'm talking about the present fender that's on there, the aft end of that fender. About how much overlap do you want with this makeshift fender? Just give me an Idea. I think I could figure out when I get there, but I'd rather have your feelings before I do.
|CAPCOM|We think if you get it out about 4 inches past that fender — you understand what this looks like when you get it put on the fender, if it just looks like sort of a roll and end up with a sort of a straight fender right at the back end of the Rover -a sort of a straight — about half a pipe straight out there. And, if you —
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 14:20 GET 137:27 534/1
137:27:00|CAPCOM|About half the pipe straight out there, and if you get it out 4 or 5 inches, why that will keep the dust from coming back over the vehicle.
|CERNAN| would be about right, 4 to 5 inches. It's just sort of like a horizontal fender, like on an old automobile.
|CERNAN| ing about.
|CAPCOM|Say again, Geno
|SCHMITT|Hey, John, this is Jack. Did you say pipe a minute ago? Pipe?
|CAPCOM|Yes, but it doesn't roll up into a circle, it's sort of a hemisphere. I mean it's half of one.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay, I thought I was reading you until you said pipe, and then you lost me. Okay, I think I understand, too.
|CAPCOM|You know the problem I have with communication.
|SCHMITT|Hey, thank you, Babe, we'll give it a try. And we can get something to work.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we can watch you on the tube and make recommendations - I think you've got the idea that -you know Terry Neil thought of those (garble) clamps, and that's a great idea cause you can clamp those things on that -over the dovetail, you can put a force on there, those (garble) will never get loose.
|SCHMITT|Yes, on those other clamps we had, I was thinking about paper clips, but never hacked it.
|CAPCOM|We tried that - they just don't have - they don't have the push.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got a detailed procedure here if you want to copy it just in case.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| map last night, and recalling what I saw during landing and where I was planning on putting it down and everything, I still think, to the best of my knowledge, that we are about 1 to 2 o'clock, an hour increase up to about 200 meters or so west and slightly north of Poppy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Okay, Geno.
|CERNAN| terday is this depression out at 9 o'clock here, which is greatly undersized Triton, really is not Triton and I said yesterday, I didn't see how we could be that close, but we really aren't, Tritan is way out there, and I'll still hold to my 200 meters at 1 to 2 o'clock of Poppy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're thinking you might have, on the way to the geology stops, driven between a couple of the Triton craters then.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 14:20 CST 137:27 GET 534/2
137:27:00|CERNAN| I went all the way around to the east of the last one going also.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| where we were going to land, I could have told you exactly, but once you decide where it's going to be, then you decide where if and where it's going to be if you forget everything else around you1.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Besides, Gordy, when you land on a boat all you're worried about is that the boats thexe. You let the captain worry about where it is.
|CERNAN|
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 137 hours 34 minutes. America with Ron Evans is behind the Moon. We'll acquire in 40 minutes on the 25th revolution.
|SCHMITT|Gordy, while we eating have you got a short synopsis of the news?
|CAPCOM|Ah, yeah. Sure do. Standby one. We'd like biomed left, please.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| my suit on.
|CAPCOM|Okay. As you might have expected front pages around the country are headlining last night's EVA with photographs taken from TV monitors showing you and Jack going about your tasks. I might add that the TV camera is really spectacular. It couldn't have been a clearer or more beautiful picture both for fidelity and color. In other news, South Vietnams President Thieu has suggested that all prisoners of war be released before Christmas. He has also asked that all Vietnamese parties be included in peace negotiations. South Vietnam and the Viet Cong are now not directly represented in the secret talks now under way in Paris. Meanwhile Kissinger met for more than 4 hours yesterday with Hanoi Representative Le Due To. The two negotiators are expected to meet again this afternoon. The former President, Harry Truman, is still resting quietly, although his condition remains serious according to his Doctors. American poet Mark Vandoren died at the age of 78.

137:37:00|CAPCOM|President Nixon announced yesterday that he wants to extend wage controls beyond the scheduled April 30, expiration date. He also plans to freeze new hiring, promotions, and pay increases for executives of the Federal Government, which doesn't effects us, I guess. The Republican National Committee has a new Chairman.
|CHALLENGER|How about me?
|CAPCOM|George Bush of Houston, who is Ambassador to the United Nations. He will continue his UN post through the present session of the General Assembly. Both National Political Parties are now headed by Texas. As you recall Robert Strauss of Dallas, became Chairman of the Democratic National Committee last Saturday. And Jack, I'm sorry to say that you've been replaced. The Nimbus 5 weather Satellite is now operating after lodge from Vandenberg early Monday Mo rning.
|CHALLENGER|Can it talk?
|CAPCOM|Joe, Namath, tried mightly to lead the Jets to the play-offs, but the Oakland Raiders grounded the Jets in the 4th quarter 24 to 16. I think you have all ready heard that score. Namath passed some more than 400 yards, but he was only able - New York only scored 1 touchdown. And the last item concerns the Houston weather, which is been - there has been two kinds of weather since you all left us. That's cold and light rain and cold and heavy rain. And it's still doing it. Fog and drizzly rain are here now and we're only suppose to get up to the mid 40s and probably down to 32 tonight. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Holy, Moly. That doesn't sound too good on the weather. I'm going to take a look, right here on the overhead window.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, you're right, there's a band of clouds that comes right up the coast of Mexico, and It looks like (faded) gets up into the Texas area and Southeastern part of the United States with a - with a counter clockwise rotation which gets very bad right over the Atlantic, I believe off the Southern East Coast of the states and from about oh I guess, it may be Center Texas straight north, straight east, it looks like the whole country's cloudy.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Florida looks nice, West Coast of Mexico 1ooks nice.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|And towards(garble) the weather's great.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 14:3SCST, 137:42GET, 536/1
137:42:00|CHALLENGER|Hey Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Roger, Gordy, how's the ALSEP doing and in that light I hope you people will take as close a look as you can at the signal strength and it's variation and see if you get some idea whether when I go after the flux neutron tomorrow if I ought to work on that antenna alinement again. I'm still a little bit concerned about it .
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack we'll consider that although they've been getting good performance out of the central station as I understand and a couple problems with the experiments. One was the LEAM data isn't sensing up like it should. I'll have to get a further more complete story on that. And we're thinking that's mostly on ground software problem. The other one is the LSG isn't leveling up properly and we'll cover this further in the planning briefing for the EVA here but we're probably going to let you off - I mean have Geno let Jack off at the rover - I mean at the ALSEP. Let him off when you're over at the ALSEP and take another look at the leveling on the LSG. That'll be at the end of the EVA.
|CHALLENGER|Roger, I just may run out there and let Gene pick me up after I turn them, while he fixes the fender maybe -we'll work that out Gordy. I'm joking but maybe I could go kick the lean - that might help it.
|CAPCOM|Let's make sure we've got all our problems solved down here before you do that.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, hey Family Mountain the north evasive slope although Lohr has boulders and out crop - I mean delayed outcrop. It has boulders from local block concentrations. Looks very much like the south Massif does.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|GARBLE I've about had it I think.
|CHALLENGER|GARBLE
|CHALLENGER|No, I've had to.
|CHALLENGER|Oh.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Hey Gordo, we're still eating but let me give you a few observations. That outcrop I talked about was way at the top of South Seas at the Great Slope at the very top of the Great Slope. Almost looked - it's hard to tell on an inflight outcrop up there. It's hard to convince myself that it Is. Looks like there's some very large and many, many small fragments of large - like 3 and 4 meter rock up there and a lot of smaller fragments. I see that type of thing a number of places over the South Massif, however, I do see today also they all seem to be sitting on top of the South Massif surface but I do see one other area that it looks like there is a - it is protruding from within some sort of mantle on the South Massiff So conceivably some of that could be a plate. An additional impression I got is - is that at least with the monocular that those fragments - those boulders, look much more angular than what we've seen here and for the most part they appear to be - if covered at all - very little by any mantle except the one I just mentioned.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 14:3SCST, 137:42GET, 536/2
137:42:00|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CHALLENGER|And Gordy through the monocular the contrast of the tan gray of the south Massif - those large blocks up there look blue - very distinctly blue-gray. Not unlike Gene mentioned yesterday anorthosite. Anorthosites look in certain terrestrial en vi ronments.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|And Gordy now that I get my - my threee di mensional eyeballs working I can look up on the scarp, out to 9 and 10 o'clock. It's practically the same color as the South Seas. It just looked to be very undulating. I see no outcrops evidence from here in the scarp. I think I can just about see where a hole in the wall is - it's so subtle that I can't really tell you much about it and the local terrain which I think is the southern rim of camelot just about blanks out where Hole in the Wall should be - just about covers it up, but what I can see in that small little saddle to our local horizon here in front of us I can see out there just about - oh, I'd say a hundred meters or so to the south of Hole in the Wall and it just looks like a Sun undulating flow. We can't really tell too much the steepness from here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, stand by.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I had something for you but we just decided to cancel. Although, when you do get out the prep & post card I have one write in for you so just holler when you want i t h an dy .
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12712/72 CST 14:46 GET 137:53 MC-537/1
137:53:00|CHALLENGER|We're wrapping up our evening drinking,1j here now Gordy. We'll be ready to go in a minute.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, at 137 hours 55 minutes. The crew of Challenger is 1 hour behind their timeline. This is a hold over from EVA 1. We will continue1j to run this hour behind so unless, we get further behind during the EVA preparations, we would anticipate EVA 2 to begin around 140 hours 10 minutes elapsed time, versus the 139 hours 10 minutes in the flight plan. 140:10 would be a few minutes past 5:00 PM central time. America is still out of range. We expect acquisition in 18 minutes.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, Challenger. Could you ask some body there in the FAO console to, where the hiking kit is stowed.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Will do.
|CAPCOM|Jack, take a look on the righthand side stowage compartment there, forward lower corner under the LEC Kit compartmen t.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, you broke up with the change over or something, say again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. You're right I got caught right in the middle of a site handover. Look on the right hand side stowage compartment forward lower corner, under the LEC Kit compartment.
|CHALLENGER|Fantastic. You picked the one place I'd never look.
|CHALLENGER|Houston. Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|One quick thought about the gravimeter, and I'm sure it's been mentioned, but all I said during the CS-squared, we asked about that bundle of wires that has contact with the Gimbal and when I deployed it that bundle was - is still in contact with the GIMBAL and every body at the CS burn said that was okay. But, you might think about it. I don't know what I could do to help if that is the problem, but that might be causing the problem here, that it wouldn't cause on Earth.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack I'll make sure the experts hear that.

138:07:00|CHALLENGER|Gordie, everything okay at home today?
|CAPCOM|Yes, everything is fine here.
|CHALLENGER|Well, thank you.
|CAPCOM|I'm not sure I copy your question precisely. Haven't talked to your home today at all.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, don't worry about it. I just thought you might have heard.
|CHALLENGER|Well, if you hear Gordie just tell them thei r mis sed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll sure do that.
|CHALLENGER|Gordie, has anybody hear from Tucson recently?
|CAPCOM|Check on that, Jac, just a minute.
|CHALLENGER|And, Gordie, if you have any updates to the EVA 2 checklist give me a yell.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the update I do have. I think the EVA checklist changes we'll just call your real time. But, I do have one for the prep card.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, on the front side there middle column lower half at 138:45 OBS connect half way down it says install purge valve in PGA red to red. Mark that LMP serial number 211 CDR 208. This is to maximize the OBS operation should you have to use it.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, give me the numbers again, please.
|CAPCOM|LMP 211, CDR 2 0 8.
|CHALLENGER|I take it those are serial numbers.
|CAPCOM|That's right, the serial numbers on the purge valve.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger this is Houston would you like to have a little update on the EVA plan?
|CHALLENGER|Do you want me to take notes.
|CAPCOM|No, I don't think there are essentially any notes required. I'll make a few real time callouts to you, but I don't think there is anything you really have to write down.
|PAO|Bob Parker is capcom now.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Bob I realize that things were getting a little hectic yesterday, but if we end up making any changes where I don't need to get a charge in my hands that's an awfully good thing to call because not only does it tire your hands out holding it, but it means you don't get as many pictures or rover samples or anything else.
|CAPCOM|Roger, you guys are just ahead of us today, we were trying to get that up to you. Okay, no I don't think there is anything here that really needs to be written down. I'll go through with you first and we can talk about details and
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 15:00 GET 138:07 538/2
138:07:00|CAPCOM|writing in if you want to on any of them if you want to. But I don't think there is anything that really needs to be written in. The EVA is going to be essentially nominal with two minor exceptions. One is the -your allower about five minutes extra at the LM before leaving for the rover fender fix and John will be talking to you about that in a minute. And the second big change is that we're also allowing five more minutes at the end of the EVA so that we can have extra time for dusting. And I suspect that if the rover fender fix works and we aren't getting as dirty as we'did last night, then we may gain back that five minutes. Your also allowed - what we've done is taken the time here out of some of the tasks at station three and station four. And along with the fact that we think you're a little bit further east than planned and we're allowing four minutes additional gliding time. But again, that's all real time and if we're doing well on time we can reinstitute all those tasks, and get rid of the five minutes that we are allowing here, there or elsewhere. So that's just sort of keeping you thinking. There is a possibility that we'll have some additional overhead at each stop depending on what the rover battery temperatures are when you get out this morning. If the rover - if their high again then we'll have to probably park at least on some of the stops if not all with the upsun heading and dusting the battery covers and then opening them to let them cool. But, again that will depend upon what we find on the rover batteries when we get out this morning. The variations that we found on the surface of the south massif indicating a pos-sility of flarings. I guess you saw those mostly with the binocular. And the observation of boulder tracks and the size of the massif emphasizes the importance of sampling boulders that can be traced to sources if there is elvation on the massif. Now, I guess we should say that hopefully. Then we'll just have to see what happens when we get down to station two on that. But if we see boulders with tracks I'm sure you guys remember that they will obviously have a higher prioritv. Since, we'didn't get to Emory and since we'didn't really get to the rim of Steno itself the question of sampling - of the actual subfloor is still somewhat ambigious; although, there is a large consensus opinion that says that we sampled the subfloor we sampled at intermediate gabbro that we sampled yesterday at both the ALSEP station one. There is possible alternative conclusion which says that the subfloor has not been sampled, but that these blocks that we sampled and the surface are both parts of a later flow. And, in that line we're still looking for specific observations that will help
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 15:00 GET 138:07 538/3
138:07:00|CAPCOM|distinguish between whether or not the dark mantle is a - whether the dark mantle is a separate unit upon the intermediate gabbro that we are seeing or whether it's the - stand by. Okay, whether or not the dark mantle is an entirely separate unit from the intermediate gabbro you were sampling yesterday, or whether it just represents the top of very well churned up layer of a flow that was later than the subfloor - if you see what I'm saying there. All this says is that we're very interested, of course -
|CHALLENGER|Roger, Bob.
|CAPCOM|- all this says is that we're very much more interested in station five, as you might expect than we were before. And I guess for this reason we'll be trying to keep the timeline a little tighter than usual to guarantee that we've got some time leftover at station five. And, we're also interested in perhaps moving of station five at it's present location there in the southwest of Camelot over to the southeast or east or some location we have a feeling that it's got big boulders up on the rim. This is so we can sample, hopefully some of the white material and some of the boulders together. And get a better confirmation that the materials from deep in the subfloor unit is this intermediate gabbro as opposed to just material from the upper part of the subfloor. It's just a matter of keeping to ourselves the number of boulders we sampled yesterday are from deep in the subfloor only if the surface of the subfloor or perhaps as I said the other alternative being that the intermediate gabbro is part of the dark mantle and we're seeing a churned up regolith on top of it sort of being the gaseous upper part of the flow that has been broken down rather rapidly into the dark mantle. Okay, stand by a minute. Okay, to summarize that again reading - I guess I got ahead of myself in the little deal they wrote up. At the present time we have two working hypothesis from the dark mantle and the gabbro relationships to each other. One, the frisment of rocks that we found in the gabbro are an upper unit of the s ub -floor with their dark mantle cover unrelated to them in time. Key observations, that they suggest here is trigger the Camelot station five and other deep craters. Espeically, perhaps a trench and sheltered spots which are unguarded - ungardened as in plowed for an older regolith underneath the dark mantle if such a thing can be found. we'don't think we found that yesterday. Or, you look at the super position relations between dark mantles and boulders. Are the mantles instances of the mantle on the boulders or inversely of small boulders on the mantle.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 15:13 GET 138:20 MC539/1
138:20:00|CAPCOM|The second working hypothesis is that, the dark mantle is regolith derived from a vitreous vesicular flowtop of the crystalline rock both beneath. And, it again goes to say that perhaps that the gabbro that we sampled yesterday was indeed the (garble) flow, and what the regolith was was derived from the vitreous vesicular flowtop, as it were. Again, many of the same observations are called for. In particular, they'd be interested then in looking for the coarser finds they define as from a millimeter to 20 millimeters for some sort of transitional lithologies and textures. In other words, what do the small walnut-size rocks look like, if you can and have specimens? If I can get more specific in terms of the EVA mechanics, let me say that we'll call out in realtime the deletion of the tasks at Stations 3 and 4, if they become necessary, and what we're planning on doing is deleting the trench in the base of the Scarp at Station 3 and also, deleting the radial sample on the -on Shorty at Station 4. That's the provision that we're planning on, and depending on how the time is going, we'll call that ot realtime. We also have -- experiments remain pretty much the same. We'll deploy the charges at the same locations as we're planning in the checklist at the present time. We also don't -we're planning further ahead, we'don't anticipate any significant changes in EVA—3. The charge number 5, which we're going to deploy at Emory, will not -- but didn't, will not be deployed during EVA-2, but we'll deploy it on EVA-3 out at Station 10. And, what we're going to do there, is when you take the 8-pounder and put it between the seats, we'll then have the 3-pounder left over, and we'd like to put that on one of the footpads in the Sun — that's probably either the minus 2 or minus Y footpad. And, we'll leave it there in the Sun until the start of EVA-3, in which case we'll put in the Rover underneath the LMP1s seat. And, thermally that looks okay. There is a probability that we're going to play the "Return to the ALSEP Game", and we're going to do this for a couple of reasons. One, we're going to go back and look at getting some more ALSEP photos. I guess Gordy says you've got that. And, that will probably be at the end of EVA -- in fact, it will certainly be, if it happens, at the end of EVA-3 when you go back to get the neutron flux probe. I might also say with regard to EVA-3 that, obviously, we're more interested in Station 10 than we were before. Another "Return to the ALSEP" goodie that we're looking at, if we have the consumables today when you get back from finishing Station 5, is that the lunar1' surface gravimeter has been unable to level Itself over the night, and they sent some — oh, some thousand commands trying to get it straightened out, and they say it looks as though it's not level. And, so, we'd like Jack to go back with his practiced hand on bubble levels and recheck that at the end of — after Station 5 today, if there's sufficient consumables. And, we've planned for Gene to just let Jack off and let him walk back to the LM after he gets off and looks at that. And, that about — everything we have, as I say, in summary, that the big changes are going to be extra time at the beginning, taking care of the fender extension, and the probability of extra time at the end although we'll have to see how well the fender works and how things go. The probability of extra time at the end to allow for dusting, and the time spent on those particular activities we'll probably end up taking out of the task at Station 3 and Station 4. Over. Commen ts ?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 15:13 GET 138:20 MC539/2
138:20:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Bob. We copy all that. Obviously you're going to have to catch us in realtime on some of the details there on the charges and the task deletion. One question. Did you say we were going to delete the trench at S t ati on 3 ?
|CAPCOM|Roger. The trench at the base of the Scarp, in other words, some of the stuff that you would be doing while Gene was taking the double core.
|CHALLENGER|What do you gain by that?
|CAPCOM|Well. No comment on that, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|If you haven't deleted Gene's tasks, then what am I supposed to do?
|CAPCOM|You're supposed to help Gene, I guess.
|CHALLENGER|Well, but that's not the way we worked it, Bob. Let's play that one in realtime.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's why I said there's no point in marking up the checklist on that, Jack. Let me hit you with one more thing concerning the battery temps. An initial reaction down here is that the battery temps were high on deployment because of particularly unfavorable heat soaking on the way out. And, the Marshall people are hopeful that they'll be back to normal this morning. However, we're obviously anxious, as I'm sure you are to get an early reading on the battery temps. That's number 1. And number 2, just for the off chance that the meter's not working, I think we've pretty much discounted that because of the way the meter worked yesterday. But, on the off chance that the meter's not working, you might just lean over and see if the meter is reading zero before you punch in the circuit breakers, because that would give us at least a partial confirmation in that direction that there's not something wrong with the offset. If they're reading — sitting there reading 30 to 40 degrees, then that probably says something about the offset. And, beyond that —
|CHALLENGER|(Garble)
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|I'll look at that, Bob, but the meter has indicated in terms of a temperature change. I'll look and sec if there's a bias on them at all.
|CAPCOM|Rog. We -- we again also think that that's probably not too likely.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 15:13 GET 138:20 MC539/3
138:20:00|CHALLENGER|Bob, I think, based on what I saw yesterday, that the chances are pretty good that all the big blobs out here in the dark mantle area will be pretty much the gabbros. By the way, I looked at that with a (garble) last night, and I don't know if you got the reports, and I'm back to saying that it's probably closer to 30 -- 40 percent plagioclase. It's probably just a good gabbro, a final pyroxene gabbro, and it apparently has a fair amount of ilmenite in it. There's some bright shiny flakes within the rocks and some dark minerals in the matrix that's probably ilmenite, and one other additional possibility then is that the mantling massif here is the just dark fine glass — darker than usual because of the iron and the titanium in the rock itself. Also, the probability I think still has to be considered that you re dealing with a true mantle that has been gardened enough that it leads us to where we're seeing it now in the first few tenths of centimeters that it is unrecognizable as a mantling unit yet. The relationship to the large boulders is, I think, one right now just ilemine and a small amount of covering because of the local gardening process. We haven't seen any clearly mantling relationships between the dark mantle or the surface materials here and the large boulders.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that. And, we'll be anxious to see what else you find out today, and one last word for your interest; the Marshall people have decided to allow us to go to 140 degrees on this EVA with the batteries if necessary.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, now John would like to talk to you about the fender fix.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Hold on for 30 seconds. _APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 , 15:22 CST, 138:29GET, 540/1
|CERNAN| check my biopad out, we're going left.
|CAPCOM|Okay, fine we'll take a check, Geno. Let me ask you one question here on Jack's water - his PLSS water cell. We're showing about 3 pounds too much water in the LM system and we're wondering if you got the AUX tanks filled up in Jack's PLSS. Two questions. Were you sure to have the AUX valve open and did you see good clear water in the sight gage with no bubbles after the fill. Over.
|CHALLENGER|I guess we'd have to say yes to those ques tions but if you've got a question on it we can go through it again. I'd rather do that than take a chance.
|CAPCOM|Let me make sure we want to do that. While we're making sure I checked with both home front and Nassau Bay and Tuscon are both in good shape. Geno, Tracy upstaged you for about 30 minutes last night on local TV during her own interview there and threw everybody away from watching EVA during that time. She did very well.
|CERNAN| you say Jack's PLSS - did you see the water drop in the LM when we charged mine?
|CAPCOM|It was the profile of the water quantity as you were filling both PLSSes and it was the fill during Jack's fill that looked suspicious like just maybe 3 pounds less than there should have been flow when you were filling Jack's.
|CERNAN| know whether or not you've got it filled. I sure don't want to go out there and have him just have some partial water so let's do the conservative thing.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll verify that. There was some drinking water going out at that time too which levels up the data a little bit so we're not absolutely certain on that.
|CERNAN| filling the PLSS, however.
|CERNAN| on that and I'm ready to copy, John.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, I don't think you need to copy this. Sort of just add lib it. With your four chronopaque maps, tape two maps and allow about 1 inch overlap to a 15 inch by 10-1/2 inch configuration that's estimate and then repeat with two other maps and then tape both the two maps - now four maps - tape them together, and you'll end up with a sheet that's about 15 inches by 19 inches, sheet of chronopque. And then tape both sides of it - the overlapping edges to strengthen it and you can further strengthen it if you tape an X of tape across both sides of it and then on the roll up on the long axis and secure it with a strip of tape and put it in the ETB and on that strip of tape you secure it with be sure and leave a tab on the end of it so you can get if off with your gloves. And then remove clamps from both the utility light units and open the clamp jaws to max. And then tighten the mounting bracket that you've got on it so it will be swinging around and stow the clamps in the ETB. You got that Gene?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 , 15: 22CST, 138:29GET, 540/2
138:29:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and then now you've got everything you need and it's all put together and all ready to be fastened to the rover and then when you get the ETB in the seat you unroll the corner page sheet and you locate the front edge with the long axis fore and aft even with the axle. And you lay the edge of the sheet over the inboard guide rail and you clamp it. You lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard guide rail and clamp it. And as I said the inboard clamp must be directly over the axel to avoid interference while steering. And tighten the clamps securely, both of them. And then while you're driving around out there by yourself, it would be good if Jack could take a look at it and see if you're getting any unusual dynamics and at station 2 you should inspect the fender for any unusual wear that might have been caused by this mass out there on the fender of those clamps bouncing up and down. One thing about it, doing it in the suit Gene, you have to push in with your leg and hold - and it's sort of a two handed job and I'm not sure in l/6g if you could position the fender the pseudo fender on there without Jack say holding on to the long end behind the rover so that won't fall off. It works okay in lg for 1 man but I'm not sure it's not a 2g proposition - the 2 man proposition in 1/6, over.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and you really have to bear down to get those things on the dovetail there.
|CERNAN| We want to put the - take two of those pages and put the 10 inch side together overlapping, right?
|CAPCOM|Yes sir.
|CERNAN| together overlapping right?
|CAPCOM|That's true.
|CERNAN| now and put them end to end so you've got a long fender.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Well, you end up with 4 - you end up with all 4 pieces in a big rectangle. You see what I'm saying, you've got a 15 inch by 19 inch sheet of paper.
|CERNAN| had no overlap I guess you'd have about 16 by 20.
|CAPCOM|That's correct.
|CERNAN| of it gives it more strength - which you need in that situation.
|CAPCOM|You just want to make sure it's not more than an inch or you won't have enough to cover up those dovetails. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 15:22CST, 138:29GET, 540/3

|CERNAN| go to the ALSEP, do you think? Or do youthink we both have to do this fender?
|CAPCOM|No, the ALSEP work we're not going to do until the end of the EVA.

|CAPCOM|And, Jack, if Gene's working there on unstowing SCB whatever it is, 5, yeah, 5 -- maybe when you put the camera down, you might want to shoot off a few 500—millimeter frames of the North and South Massifs, if they look interesting. I can't tell from the TV. That might be an opportune time to grab a couple .
|SCHMITT|If they look interesting. If they look interesting! Now what kind of thing is that to say?

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay let's go. Everytime you pick your seat belt up carry it it's not twisted now.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you all set?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack a reminder we 11 still reading you on intermediate, you probably want to go to min before you get back on ...
|SCHMITT|He's back on now, and we re rolling.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy your moving.
|CERNAN| sir1'
|CAPCOM|Okay, one other thing I might mention to you guys is your driving here, Jack, before you start talking again. Is that as you go by Camelot you might keep an eye out for blocks along the rim there. Because you may be wanting to come back and move station five to an area where there is blocks unless there are blocks at the present nominal station five so you might keep an eye for that and plan for the way back. A second thing a reminder if you do stop for a rover sample that are one thing or another along the way give us a call and keep us informed because we're timing you on the way out and the assumption is, of course, that driving time out equals drive back time, and we're under a 63 minute limit to get you from the LM out to the station 2 because of OPS drive back. So keep us informed so we can keep a good tab.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. Okay, we 11 keep you informed. Bob, I got the thing two blocked and I'm averaging probably 10 to 11 clicks. It's not exactly straight line navigation but I think I can hold most of it.
|CAPCOM|Roger beautiful.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And, Jack a reminder -
|SCHMITT|When Gene decides to turn.
|CAPCOM|Jack, a reminder on photos yesterday you apparently took quite a few on the way back from station one to the sep and we're right nominal on budget now, but considering the fact that we'didn't do much sampling you continue to use them at the rate you did yesterday going back from station 1 at least we understand you'll be pushing us pretty hard in the budget. Should be every fifteen meters or every 100 mete rs.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 18:32 GET 141:39 554/2
141:39:00|SCHMITT|Bob, okay and you want to hear something.
|CAPCOM|Roger, I'll listen now.
|SCHMITT|Okay, the surface is not changing in terms of the detail. The surface texture of the fine grained regolith still there is a raindrop pattern. We're more - the block still look very much like what we sampled yesterday around the LM. Their light colored fairly gabbros with zap pits - zap halos. Occasional craters show lighter colored ejectas both all the way down to say half a meter in size. Other craters that are just as blocky as those with bright halos to have no brightness associated with them. Most of the brighest craters have a little central pit in the bottom which is glass lined. The pit is maybe a fifth of the diameter of the crater itself. It's a very standard thing for most of these fresher craters is that little central pit. Okay, we're just south of the rim of Camelot. There is a light mantle on the other side. Look at that crater. Woo We've got the - oh, and there's Camelot. Oh Manechevitz woo Take a coupleof pictures looking at that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes. Okay, I got them. That is a 600 meter crater.
|CAPCOM|How about a bearing range to help us pick out the (garble). Rog, how about bearing the range and then we'll pick out the (garble).
|SCHMITT|Okay 0831.2 and 1.0.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Now that little crater in the ejecta did not - of Camelot at least the rim of Camelot did not bring up the blocks on the rim. It may have been an old depression. Bob, there is extremely blocky area. This - I think station five was over there where that block area is. The light colored area on the photos are essentially blocky. They're probably 30 percent blocks. All of them or many of them are in the 2 to 3 to 4 meter size range. All of them look light colored look like the gabbro we sampled from a distance. They have.light halo zap pits on them. I see only occasional grayer varieties which I believe are the non-vesicular ones like we also sampled.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Jack very good.
|SCHMITT|the light colored gabbros are dominant.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SCHMITT|Okay, station five would have been rather than in a light colored area was in a very blocky area. Station five is probably still very good for blocks.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 18:32 GET 141:39 554/3
141:39:00|SCHMITT|there is probably as big blocks there as anywhere on the rim that we've seen.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| Horatio and Camelot.
|SCHMITT|No, I'm going to give them a call when we're due south of Camelot and see if they can't get a position on us .
|CERNAN| You can go around that one. You bet you. I suppose it's beat up a little bit.
|SCHMITT|You can unwrinkle your toes now.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, I wouldn't worry, Gene. Watch that block there it's probably more than 14 inches. And got a fairly close look at the rock and it is the vesicular - looks very much like the vesicular line appearance like gabbro.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CERNAN| or the rim is mantle with the same dark gray material and It has the same surface texture - a very fine raindrop pattern. The saturation crater size does not look bigger than a half a meter at that. OkayBob, I'm going to give you 0811.6 and 1.4. We're south of the center of the center of Camelot.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you Gene.
|CERNAN| Horatio here pretty quick.
|SCHMITT|I think it's right up in front of us.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We can definitely see the light mantle as it comes out over the valley here and we're looking at Hole-in-the-Wall although it's still too subtle. We're looking right at Lara as a matter of fact.
|CERNAN| in-the-Wall you can see it.
|SCHMITT|Yes. There's Horatio way over there where those blocks are. See it?
|CERNAN| course sir. There's a little depression we'didn't talk about though between Horatio and Camelot, but It's a depression and not a blocky crater at all. As a matter of fact the total block population has changed out on the - once we get away from the rim of Camelot block frequency is quite a bit smaller. It's down maybe to only less than one percent of the surface.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 18:32 GET 141:39 554/4
141:39:00|SCHMITT|Much easier driving with the rover?
|CERNAN| Very obvious that the rover navigation because of the blocks and because of the smaller (garble) craters and very subtle type craters that are in this area. There are up to 2 meter bright halo blocky craters and that's blocky wall craters that may be instant rock I think it is rather than bedrock in the rim area of Camelot.
|SCHMITT|Horatio has got to be - there's Horatio right there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 1840 CST 141:47 GET MC 555/1
141:47:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's Horatio.
|CERNAN| rim of Horatio.
|SCHMITT|the scarp looks very smooth from here - no obvious outcrops at this time. Don't seem to be penetrating to any bedrock in the area we're traversing now just to the southeast of Horatio. Horatio has a blocky wall, however, the upper several tens of meters probably of rim looks as if its either mantle or composed of the light gray regolith material we've been driving on. The blocks do not come to the rim of Horatio.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Jack.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Horatio has quite a different appearance than Camelot. It is - that's the main one - the blocks do not get to the rim.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I know its not much but it seems like a lot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It looks like - if Horatio is any gage, the rim thickness, maybe, this is a wild guess, Bob, but maybe an average of 20 or 30 meters (garbled) thickness lies above the exposures of the subfloor, exposures being blocks in the wall. And some of those blocks again are several meters, if not 5 to 10 meters in diameter. And they're concentrated on the west rim that I can see.- there are very few blocks on the east - excuse me, the west wall, but very few blocks on the east, north or south walls of Horatio.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, Jack.
|CERNAN| 0 78 2.3 and 2.0.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we're maybe a hundred meters south of the rim. Actually, we're on the rim crest. We're a hundred meters south of the break and slope into the crater.
|CERNAN| traverse terrain in here, Jack. These little craters make it bumpy, but other than that its really smooth sailing.
|SCHMITT|that's right. This is what I sort of expected dark mantle to look like rather than what we landed on. Not more than one percent of the surface and that percentage continues right over the rim crest of Horatio down on the wall until you hit the big blocks.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, we're not to Bronte yet, I don't have any -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, and how about an amp and a mobility - a speed reading.
|SCHMITT|I've been pushing anywhere from 9 to 11 clicks and most of the time its full out and amperes are about to around 100 apiece. APOLLO L7 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 18:40 CST 141:47 GET MC-555/2
|CERNAN| to see.
|SCHMITT|I know they are.
|CERNAN| full bore most of the time and all I can get out of this is 10 clicks and when I decelerate I decelerate in a hurry. What's our next stop here, a sample at 3.9.
|SCHMITT|A - 08 03.9.
|CERNAN| 2.6. I think we've got to add a little bit to that. (garbl)
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by, we'll get a new correction for you guys on that shortly.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. The surface is not changing, we see no craters that seem to penetrate into bedrock out in here - that is with blocky rims and that is quite a contrast to the area we sampled at station 1A yesterday. I see - I cannot see from my field of view any blocky rimmed craters. There are slight craters with fragmental walls and rims but it looks like instant rock rather than the subfloor material.
|CERNAN| turn a little bit - on the dark area of the south massif where you get those impressed radiations - see them going from left to right ?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I see what you mean, right.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, they go obliquely up the slope.
|CERNAN| linear wrinkles.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, craniallations, you might say, in the slope that look something like those I saw from orbit -looking in the shadowed area - at the edge of the shadow. Bob, we see craters as much as 20 meters, maybe 30 meters diameter without blocky rims.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|the rim block population is not much di f - The rim block population is not much different than the average for the terrain in here..
|CERNAN| the change in that albedo when we get under that white mantle I'm going to be surprised.
|SCHMITT|Mark my words. Okay, the light mantle is just what Gene has said, its a - that's it right now -there are some very bright craters in It they stand out, bright haloed craters scattered over it that seem to be quite a bit brighter than anything we have out here on the dark mantle.
|CERNAN| first different colored blocks I've seen, they're sort of grey looking.
|SCHMITT|Where are you looking?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Watch yourself here. Okay, there's a crater with a big mass of block in the bottom. It looks like there might be a secondary fragment from somewhere.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|How's our time for traverse, Bob? Do we have time for an LRV sample?
|CAPCOM|You're doing great, so far. We're looking for our first LRV sample at about 4.2 - that's in the light mantle. If you can do it quickly - but Its - a - we weren't planning on it.

|CERNAN| side of Bronte and it looks like Bronte has penetrated the dark mantle in here, it got the subfloor.
|SCHMITT|there's not an awful lot of blocks around the v1rim, just some small ones, compared with what we saw around — watch it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|With what we've seen around Horatio, the walls of Horatio and around Camelot. Nothing at all like we saw yesterday at station 1. Bob, that characteristic little dimple in the bottom of the craters is still with us and it's invariably glass-lined in the fresh ones.
|CAPCOM|Okay, very good.
|SCHMITT|Now, that's not a complete lining. It just seems to be glass — a group made, if you will — that's holding the fragments in the bottom of the crater together. There's one on the side of an older crater. We're back in about a one percent coverage. I suspect that the reason we are - the block population went up there was because of Bronte.
|CERNAN| glass-lined craters around.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 141:57 CST 1850 MC 556 /2
141:57:00|SCHMITT|Yeah, and you notice, Gene, what I was saying about the little dimple in the bottom.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Watch the fresh ones and they all have that little dimple as if that . . .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, right there. Man, you can predict it.
|CERNAN| is starting right over there. See on your right?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's the first -
|CERNAN| off of the - close to the slopes of the si -
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I hate to say it, but Charlie may be right.
|CERNAN| dinguish it is the bright halo craters are brighter.
|SCHMITT|But I can see it from here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep1,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the block population is unchanged, still appears to be a - well, I can see large enough blocks - appears to be the gabbro, although they're not as much to look at now as during the blocks. The surface characteristics have not changed. There are no craters that we see that are bringing up clear blocky rims. There's a - most of the fresh craters have instant rock around them. The craters are the same size. They are older and more subdued. That instant rock is apparently broken down. I suspect a small vaping break that down fairly quickly.

142:07:00|CERNAN| I wanted to do and that's get that thing really cinched down.
|PAO|We're an hour and 32 minutes into this EVA.
|CERNAN| angle difference on that light mantle when you're looking at the slopes of the Scarp versus what we're on. I hate to use a . familiar term, but my impression right here is there is more of a raindrop influence than back at the LM, we* re in a darker mantle.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|SCHMITT|. Yeah. Might be. I think so. I think the big thing is, though, that each one of these little craters is much light — much more lightly colored. But we're still not -- there's no crater in view that has a blocky rim. There's a fragmental rim based on, almost certainly, instant rock, but no blocky rims.
|CERNAN| look lighter is because of their sun angle. Walls of some of these little craters -- it's the same material we're driving on I bet. Yeah, there is instant rock right there, Jack, you're right.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the fragment population is certainly less than 1 percent in here. Now, when I say fragments, I'm talking about rocks that are -- are greater than a centimeter in screen size.
|CERNAN| seems to be a little bit more difficult to drive down sun in this area.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I think it is brighter Geno. I was thinking that a minute ago, but I started to make a — I think your normal albedo is greater.

|CERNAN| trying to keep calm with them as I'm turning here. And, I've been keeping the thing on. I don't know if they're reading it, but I've been moving it.
|CAPCOM|Reading you loud and clear, guys.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Looking up on the South Massif, we've got real good views of the block-strewn field. There's one that seems to be two dominant colorations of the rock. The light-colored ones, very light tan and too white, and then there are the blue grey rocks. There's one major outcrop of blue grey, about a sixth of the way down the slope, the center of the field of view we have, and it looks very much like similar blue grey rocks right at the crest, the highest point from our vantage point.
|CAPCOM|Okay, give me the range and bearing please.
|CERNAN| mantle here (garble)
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we want (garble). As soon as you get into the dark mantle, and we're estimating it's something like 4.34, 4.5, somewhere in that vicinity.
|SCHMITT|We're there.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We're ready for —
|SCHMITT|We're there. Now, let's — if you can — okay, right over there, and maybe I can get a rock with it. See that batch of rocks there?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Whoa. Yeah. Swing it. Whoa, now swing back over. Little more, little more. Whoa. Little more.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Now, you go forward.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hold it, right there.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| flare ups.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Thank you, Geno.
|SCHMITT|I got it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 19:00 GET 142:07 MC557/3
142:07:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got the rock. I got the rock, and there's some dirt in there. Maybe I'd better get a little bit more dirt.
|CERNAN| dirt.
|SCHMITT|Can you see in there? Is there —
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Much soil?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll get — I'll get this soil. Couple feet froi the hole.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Say again there, 17.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| getting a soil fragment — soil sample with it.
|CAPCOM|Copy.
|CERNAN| North Massif.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, there's no question that there is apparent lineations all over these Massifs in a variety of directions. Hey, look at how that Scarp goes up beside there. There's a distinct change in texture.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|As a matter of fact, lineations are not present on the Scarp that we can see where it crosses the North Massif. There is no sign of those lineations on it.
|CERNAN| about now.
|SCHMITT|Look over by Hanover.
|CERNAN| Massif, doesn't it?
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that. And that's the soil.,
|CERNAN| (garble).
|SCHMITT|Here's another one.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I won't. I'll pull it down.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|And, pray for me, Bob, that I don't lose my camera. Okay. Hanover is very — quite a ways up the slope. I don't think we'd have gotten to it, as we planned that time, but the appearance you have of the Scarp — North Massif contact is one of the Scarp being smoother textured, less cratered, and certainly less radiated. And, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it's, as Gene says, younger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 19:00 GET 142:07 MC557/4
142:07:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. Copy that.
|SCHMITT|But that goes -- it's not just the -- it's not just the slope, it's the materials on the other side of the Scarp, on the west side.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to have to really ease up on pictures now. I forgot to give them a frame count.
|CAPCOM|Yeah. You didn't give a frame count. Want to give them a frame count there, Jack?
|SCHMITT|(Garble) Well, Bob. The problem is everytime I take my hand off my camera loosens up again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. And, our estimate is that if you kind of go between 50 and 100 meters between frames we'll make it.
|SCHMITT|Boy, I tell you. Are those Massifs getting to look big now. Holy Smoley. That frame at the LRV sample was about 115 .
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|I'll tell you. That Scarp looks nice over there, too, doesn't it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, we're back down in our old friend, the dark mantle, and I think the zero face point is not as bright as it was. Passing a small crater, but the block population is still way down there in ab out, woops, watch that one, one per-cen t —
|CAPCOM|And, 17, for your benefit we're showing you real good net mobility rates here, and things looking quite good.
|SCHMITT|thank you. Gene's doing a great job.
|CERNAN| though. You look around, and you're in a hole.
|SCHMITT|Here's another small crater, instant rock, with the same little pits, a spattering of glass holding the pit materials together. None of these — none of the glass linings look very coherent, Bob. They mainly just seem to be a sprinkling of glass that's -- some, halping to, or coating the instant rock.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:09 CST 142:16 GET 558/1  
142:16:00|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that, Jack.
|PAO|We are in contact with America on the1: 2 8th revolution1!
|SCHMITT|We still don't have - the crater's1; at about 10 to 15 meters in diameter seem to have somewhat more ; blocky material in their rims. But they are not clear cut blocky rim craters and here's one that is probably 50 meters across1' that has a fair number of blocks in the bottom. Looks like it might have just about got down to where the gabbro is -, starts to be abuftdant again1;
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy on that one, Jack1
|CERNAN| to work my way up to Hole in the Wall and from there on up1,
|SCHMITT|Right, that's good.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep1j
|CERNAN| very long, very subtle, very gentle slope. We'll just have to get some more words when we get there1
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're anxiously qwaiting them1,'
|CAPCOM|How about a range and bearing while you are at it?1
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, do you know (garbled) 4.91'
|CAPCOM|Copy. 4.9 on the range1.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're losing a litttle bit of low gain, Geno-
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think we need to tilt it up a little1, probably under shooting the earth1-
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, our pitch angle changes all the time1; That's our problem1.
|CERNAN| the whole time1;
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, we're not in light mantle I don't think1;
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I guess we are1;
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Find it in my geology map pocket1.
|CERNAN| the crater are white - whiter than they have been1. So we're back in it1'
|SCHMITT|And phase points brighter too1
|CERNAN| small blocky craters within the dark mantle. They're1. not evident here in the lighter stuff.
|SCHMITT|Yep, yep1;
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:09 CST 142:16 GET 558/2
142:16:00|SCHMITT|Whhhhhhoooooo1.
|SCHMITT|Oh, boy, that really gives me a strange feeling:
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I understand.
|CERNAN| them intentional1.
|CERNAN| closer you get1. ,1'
|CERNAN| though, B ob1.
|SCHMITT|Yeah* I don1 t think that s your main1j problem1;
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Golly. That vent cooling is just about right isn't it1
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah1.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Rog. It looks like it's working to us1:
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob , I'm not — the rock fragments look1 still look like gabbro, the craters tend to have white walls and white rims which they don't have in the dark mantle area. The block population is way down - 1 percent or less. However, . the bigger craters do have more blocks, but no where does that population seem get above about 5 percent and that's on the walls and the rims of the craters, say bigger then 15 meters. There s . one probably 20 meters in diameter that has some blocks on1 lt *191-
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think Nemo is right over there if I m1, not mistaken. It's -.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Nemo will be hard to see. But, yeah,1: it's probably that one right in there1;
|SCHMITT|Or back here. There's one back here1:
|SCHMITT|It's pretty1;
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's close to Scarp. You re probably - probably right off wing there.
|CERNAN| I'm going to make a low turn. We're looking at l,ar;i.
|SCHMITT|Now, Lara I can see blocks In Ihu1, northwest rim of Lara. At least it's rugged terrain and1: looks like blocky terrain. One spot i s all I1h1 like it may be a couple hundred meters in average diameter. -It starts about maybe three-quarters of the way up the wall and goes right up to the rim.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:09 CST 142:16 GET 558/3
142:16:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Look at that - Look at that crater.
|SCHMITT|Right there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that bed, that central bed goes down about half the depth of the crater and the crater is a fresh 3 meter crater. That's - it's almost was a cylindrical pit. Hey,1. Bob, Hole in the Wall is just a step — headed down to the south or southeast on the Scarp. It's a scarp and just about what we all expected it to be. It is very rolling1' and relatively smooth. I don't really see any outcrops exposed anywhere out here to the south.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You see, now there's Station 3 area right up the re .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Looks like maybe that - set - see that bright bigger crater1over there to the right of Lara. That's probably a good place for Station 3.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, way over there1'
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Doesn't look very rocky, Gene.
|CERNAN| CAPCOME1How bearing and range guys1
|CERNAN| as I make my1turn. It's not to far - 100 meters -
|SCHMITT|Are you going to turn over that or go on closer -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|that's more than a hundred meters1-
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|there 1 s the - n ow the craters a re get ting very, very light colored, the rims and walls.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep. Yep. I think we're getting -
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:09 CST 142:16 GET 558/4
142:16:00|CERNAN| we got to watch it because I got to go around a long depression.
|SCHMITT|that's a crater over there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think -
|CERNAN| go down that hole1That one's not going to make it.
|SCHMITT|What's your pitch?
|CERNAN| I'll go over here.
|SCHMITT|What was your pitch then?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think you're right.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bear up to the right.

|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Geno.
|SCHMITT|this is the first turn of the scarp.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|See what's on tophere. You're making about 8, 8 clicks.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| known it's going up1the hill.
|SCHMITT|Looks to me like you may (, i* able to hc;i&lt;l just like you're going.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:09 CST 142:16 GET 558/5
142:16:00|SCHMITT|And get down -
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, whatever makes up the light mantle i s in
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 19:19 GET 142:26 559/1
142:26:00|CERNAN| it leaves the igneous rock it forms is much lighter than anything we see. Those fragments probably are 30 percent lighter than any fragments we see on the darkmantle. And that's a round of fresh craters. But it is not blotchy. Bob are you still reading?
|CAPCOM|Roger, read you loud and clear.
|CERNAN| antenna's working.
|SCHMITT|We're doing a little zig zag navigation. I'm - literally came up a slope at about a heading of 2 40. We couldn't get through the actual turn to the south because there is a big crater right at the foot of it so we're just making our way through some relatively local undulating slopes that get pretty steep, but there seems to be no problem.
|CERNAN| big enough to really make a statement about what the rock is. But it really doesn't look like gabbro anymore.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that and a reminder that eventually you're going to have to turn to the south a little bit to pick up a final thing at the station two.
|SCHMITT|We're not on top of that scarp yet. We're still in the Hole-in-the-Wall rim.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Bob, as far as lineations in the soil or on the surface that are observable at this range. I don't -I don't see any. I think there maybe a finer raindrop pattern on the light mantle then maybe there was out on the dark. But, that's an awfully hard judgement to make.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. How you doing, Geneo?
|CERNAN| about 5 to 8 maybe 5 to 10 clicks most of the time. I'm going to head right up there I think, get around this crater.
|CERNAN| here .
|SCHMITT|Yes, I'm going to head more straight up the hill - once I get up on top I'll be alright. I'm going to head down in this hole and then up that way.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't mind pitch, but I sure don't like rolls.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Now I'm going to head straight up that slope right there. Okay.
|PAO|Ron Evans performing infrared, ultraviolet, laser altimeter experiments.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 19:19 GET 142:26 559/2
142:26:00|SCHMITT|It looks like maybe the large fragments in here are still crystal and they have white zap pits on them. But, they do not yet really resemble a gabbros.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, copy that. Give us a hack when you get up on top of the scarp there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me tell you Bob I've got to go cross slope some of the time because the rover is really to go up hill now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 142:30 CST 1923 MC 560/1
142:30:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| across slope some of the time because the Rover's really working to go uphill now.
|CAPCOM|Alright.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|As I look up at the scarp to the west, there are some big blocks scattered around on our horizon, but again, I would guess that we're not dealing with more than two or three percent total coverage of blocks in here at that.
|CERNAN| most part, we're on top.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we're on top.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| tracks up there?
|SCHMITT|Well, they never really had any good tracks pinned down, I don't think on that - you'll be able to see Nansen soon as you get over this hill.
|CERNAN| going to be quite a sight if we can see into that Sun. We have been coming uphill.
|CERNAN| top and is she working. Come on, baby.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I think you bear -
|CERNAN| of the massif.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Head toward that track area anyway.
|CERNAN| down from the blue-gray rocks, Bob.
|CERNAN| to those tracks at Nansen or we might want to move over to the track and see if we can find the boulder that made them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, if they're in the vicinity, it might be a nice idea -
|CERNAN| come from.
|CAPCOM|And we gather you're slowing down to about 5 clicks now coming up this last rise.
|CERNAN| That's the slowdown is because that's about all it will take.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I have the Impression that there is a dipping zone of blue-gray outcrops or block concentrations up there on the massif that trend from the high point just beneath1 the earth cross slope and probably is at least the apparent depth is, oh, I don't know, 10 or 15 degrees to the east. It looks like those outcrops may match up along that trend.
|CAPCOM|Okay. f I I
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 142:30 CST 19:23 MC 560/2
142:30:00|CERNAN| because I think that'll be the depression we were talking about. :
|SCHMITT|that's Nansen down there1;
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Right below -
|CERNAN| me get over here and I'll head a little bit to the south.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we're a little more west, I think1; than we intended to be1,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, 7 - wait a minute - 7.8 and 6.5. Bob, , I've had an impression and I can't prove it yet, that we're1' dealing with a more heterogeneous rock, possibly there are breccias in here. But it's awfully hard to tell right now. There are very , bright colored rocks, I think even lighter colored than the gabbros;. 
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll soon find out,1&lt;
|SCHMITT|I'm afraid those - I think we can follow those ' tracks - the pictures, maybe1'
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think the ones from the big outcrop of ' blue—gray rock though, are the ones going into Nansen1,
|CERNAN| is that we're coming up on the northern side of Nansen1'
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that, Gene-o. '
|CERNAN| ride1
|CAPCOM|It sure sounds like it1,
|CERNAN| it would do a lot more than we'd let it1
|SCHMITT|that's right. I think that big crater up1; there on the side is the one you can see in the photograph just1. above station 21'
|CERNAN| left turn, you unbuckle your belt, you'll roll right down in to the1; bottom of Nansen1 SCHMITT I'm afraid you're right.
|CAPCOM|Okay, remember we're going to about 068 and1 7.4 station 2. At least, that's our estimate1
|CERNAN| uh, huh.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I think so1-
|CERNAN| Got to be it ,1SCHMITT Yeah, Bob, I think we're into our breccia popu- ( lation now. I think the blocks in the light mantle are largely1, breccia. They're mottled in their characteristics. Their white1 zaps do not seem to be nearly as burned and tend to be chalky1] when they get hit. At least, in the large craters, the walls1 are chalky looking. Oh, yeah, we've got boulders in station 21'
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 142:30 CST 1923 MC 560/3
142:30:00|SCHMITT|Yep, they're there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy, I tell you, if I hang on to this camera until you stop and can tighten it up, it'll be a miracle.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by. We estimate you've got about a kilometer and a half to go - a little over a kilometer, anyway. Stand by, we'll check on the time. You're doing great.
|CERNAN|
|PAO|We're 2 hours into the EVA.
|CERNAN| We're really up on top of this thing.
|CAPCOM|You guys have been driving 64 minutes and that counts the time to stop and deploy the charge and pick up the Rover samples.
|CERNAN| now, into the trough area that — that surrounds the massif, or between the mantle and the massif, but the trough is much greater in extent than just Nansen scale. It's probably a kilometer wide. I never realized that it was so much of a depression in here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, how about a range readout.
|SCHMITT|I'm not sure we're going to be able to see the LM.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We won't be able to see the LM from down here. We'll be too low to see it. Fact is, I don't think I can see that far. The surface patterns are still the same, Bob. Their main difference being that we're getting and there's probably a gradual increase in block population and the blocks seem to be of a different character. They may be breccias.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|And around the crater here, it's maybe 75 meters in diameter. The - there's probably 5 percent blocks -fragments, I should say - greater than a centimeter.
|CERNAN| I hate to think of what it would have been like with that fender gone .
|SCHMITT|there's a good sized rock, sorta blue-gray.
|CERNAN| 500 looking right up that hill, but -
|SCHMITT|Well, you may want to do that way out away, aways.
|CERNAN| buried in the massif material.
|SCHMITT|Some of it just seems to be laying on it.
|CERNAN| long it's been there. You'll tend to get the downslope movements forming uphill fillets and that's what a lot of it looks like.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 142:30 CST 1923 MC 560/4
142:30:00|SCHMITT|Most of it is uphill fillets. Most of it is p re t ty sharp .
|CERNAN| blocks on the massif were much more angular - I think it's a good guess, because that's what they look like to me here. And looking up into our blue-gray outcrop area, I still have even more  the impression that there's a - a plainer orientation that dips off to the southeast - maybe just fractory, but I - pretty clear up there, I think. It may - it may be shadows. The LM is now 50 percent away from the massif - let's see, 50 percent of the massif heigth away from the massif. How's that? I think we will keep that on to - that is a high mountain. Gemine Christmas.
|SCHMITT|Listen, if the Earth goes behind it, we're changing station 2.
|SCHMITT|It'll be nip and tuck, pardon the expression.
|SCHMITT|Okay, as we get closer, actually, we're out of the very - the block area, and in that blocky region, that 5 percent may have been associated with that crater.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 19:33 GET 142:40 MC561/1
142:40:00|SCHMITT|I still see no lineations, although —
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I mean on -- I was talking about the mantle. But, you're right about on the Massif.
|CERNAN| sloping uphill to the west on the eastern half of the Massif are still very evident at this Sun angle.
|CAPCOM|Okay 17, and we're estimating that you should be there within -
|SCHMITT|Come back up.
|CAPCOM|--- about 5 minutes to meet the walkback const rain ts.
|CERNAN| p ark .
|CAPCOM|Okay. Beautiful.
|SCHMITT|Well, I wouldn't have gone so far as to have s ai d th at.
|CERNAN| their five minutes. We'll make it by then.
|SCHMITT|Bob, the boulder tracks are really just chains of small craters, for the most part.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that. That's interesting.
|SCHMITT|I hope that they can tilt that television.
|CERNAN| camera high enough to see the top of the Massif. Jack, we're on the edge here, but I don't know — is that that (garble).
|SCHMITT|No, you're doing great. (Garble)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|See, there's Lancelot to Nansen off to my right now.
|CERNAN| not driving down a hole here, which I am, but — Don't want to drive down Nansen.
|SCHMITT|No, I — you won't. The saddle — the end of Nansen is over there near those blocks. Right over there. Look at those blocks. Unfortunately, the boulder tracks — good boulder tracks are over into Nansen.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think Station — just about anywhere near the big blocks —
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's where I'm going to put it. We could try to — let's see. Yep, that's where we're going to make Station 2, right up there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy, you're looking right into Nansen.

142:40:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We're right where we wanted to be for Station 2. And, it looks like a great place. Big blocks. It looks like quite a bit of variety from here. Different colors, anyway. Grays, and lighter colored tans.
|CERNAN| Rover at 045.
|SCHMITT|those are two good — there's a blue grey rock and a lighter colored tan rock.
|CERNAN|
|PAO|We'll have television shortly after they've parked. Station 2 is right at the face of the South Massif.

|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, reading you loud and clear.
|CERNAN| are 98, 98. Batteries are 90 and 112, and the motor forward left is off scale lower and right is 340. Forward rear is off scale lower and right is 240. I expect we've got a bad meter.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that on the 340, and you want to give me the bearing one more time there, Gene. All I got was the distance at 9.1 and the heading - range.
|CERNAN| Station 2. Look at Nansen.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. When you're at the Station, here's a couple of things —
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|— we'd like for you guys to look at in the overhead and in addition to them we'd like the TV lens to be dusted in addition to the regular dusting. That'll take the lens brush, remember.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|You might check the low gain antenna eleva tion to make sure it's at 45 degrees. We'd like — we think you commented on that, and I think you're right now looking at tightening Jack's camera handle.
|SCHMITT|I'll work on that, Gene. You go ahead with the other —
|CERNAN| me check it. I'll lose the comm on you a second. I've got to turn it towards me.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And, 17, Jack, we'd like you to take the set for us. I suspect we'll have to turn it off and open the mirrors and dust them.
|SCHMITT|Boy, when you get this picture —
|PAO|TV coming in now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 19:33 GET 142:40 MC561/3
142:40:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. Thank you. We got it on the TV.
|CAPCOM|Geno, we'do not get good bearings from you guys.
|SCHMITT|Oh, Manischewitz.
|CAPCOM|We might also check the LMP' s camera.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's fixed.
|SCHMITT|Oh, you mean for pictures?
|CAPCOM|Roger, (garble).
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. Let's turn off the power and the recorder, open1the blankets and dust it.
|SCHMITT|Power's off, blankets are open, and, Gene, you'll have to dust it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, let's see what we've got to do.
|CAPCOM|And, Jack, I presume that you turned off the receiver, didn't you? Not just the DSDA?
|SCHMITT|that's affirm. I turned off both switches.
|CAPCOM|That's what I thought. Thank you.
|SCHMITT|Oh, my scoop. My scoop just came off.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:41CST 142:48GET MC 562/1
142:48:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, and we'd like to get an EMU check on you.
|SCHMITT|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, we'd like to go to India on the magazine for you.
|PAO|Gene Cernan in the foreground.
|SCHMITT|Okay, magazine India. My goodness, we'll never get started.
|CERNAN| came down, Jack.
|PAO|Jack Schmitt in the picture, now.
|CERNAN| to go back up and then down some.
|SCHMITT|Hey, thank you for that fix on the fender by the way, cause I'd hate to see what it would look like without i t.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and John suggests that we might just check it momentarily while you're here to make sure its still holding on good and tight, (garbled) clamps and the tape.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's on my list. If it stayed on through that ride it may never come off. Okay -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah - Well, hold it a minute. I've got to get this step. Do you want me to brush this step, is that what you said?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|they should be open and dusted.
|CERNAN| gree s.
|SCHMITT|105 - or it won't work.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Here is a lint brush if you need it.
|CERNAN| all right to you? Let me get yours, lean over here and I'll get yours. Okay, I'll get mine too.
|CAPCOM|And, Jack, we're suggesting that you're getting a little warm - maybe intermediate might help.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I feel the same way but I want to get this camera fixed.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I mean, the film changed.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:41CST 142:48GET MC562/2
142:48:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Oh, thank you, Geno. It looks much better.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, okay, Houston. The number of blocks plotted on the map are not nearly enough. In the greater than one meter range there are many other blocks on the flank -on the massif flank of Nansen and up around station 2 where we are. There are only 1 or 2 blocks on the light mantle side of Nansen. It looks as if the material in the bottom of Nansen is overlighting the light mantle materials of the north wall. That's just an impression. There's slightly lighter albedo than the north wall of Nansen.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Jack. Looks so fan tastic up there.
|SCHMITT|And I suggest that we - I suggest that we'do our raking - that's right I just told you everything you could see - fairly close to the Rover to get the front of the general population of talus material coming off the massif.
|CERNAN| hammer, gnomon film - Okay. Mark if you have a gravimeter measurement going.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy the mark.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. The blue-grey rocks are breccias. They're multi-lithic, grey matrix - matrix breccias I guess. There are fragments in them, but it doesn't look like more than about 10 or 15 percent fragments. Some of the light - the light colored fragments seem to have fine-grained - very fine grained - dark haloes around them. That bit do not have white haloes so I suspect they are not crystalline. They might be glass - they might be the the mitric or glassy breccias. At least the one big rock we have here.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. SCHMIDt there's a rough, very rough, foliation in them - that - and I'm not sure its shown by the elongated knobs on the surface. It looks like a fracture foliation of some kind.
|CERNAN| come down, don't you think?
|SCHMITT|Oh, no question about it. I -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:41CST 142:48GET MC562/3
142:48:00|CERNAN| same as the blue-grey rocks we see up higher. Here's some more blue-grey ones over here.
|SCHMITT|Let's - let's start taking -
|CERNAN| these light (garbled) ones in here.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, but it still - I don't - it looks like they're dominantly matrix breccias. There - there are light coloured fragments and they may be crystalline -they are - they're very light colored - they look the shattered anorthosites, they have white haloes - I think that's what those fragments are.
|CERNAN| right here.
|SCHMITT|Okay.- biggest one here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|this is the blue gray variety, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy on that.
|SCHMITT|I want to take that little knob off up there.
|CERNAN| that block over - we can get several examples.
|SCHMITT|We ought to sample across that layering actually, that foliation.
|SCHMITT|One comment - when you look down into the bottom of Nassen it looks like - like I guess what sure is obvious - that some of the debris there has rolled off of the South Massif and covered up the original material there which covers the north wall of Nansen. There is a distinct difference - you've got that very regal texture in the north slopes of Nansen and then you've got the South Massif debris in the south slopes of Nansen and the debris of course overlays the north slope and all the rough fragments, all the boulders that have come down are all on the west side of the - of the - correction, on the south side of the slope of Nansen.
|CAPCOM|All right -
|SCHMITT|Okay, Houston, I take back what I said about no haloes. There are light - not very sharply light — but light haloes around that that's in the matrix. The matrix glass is dark and it seems to have a greenish cast but its very dark.
|CERNAN| fragments in there.
|SCHMITT|Let me come and help you there.
|CERNAN| here, Jack, (laughter)
|SCHMITT|Okay, don't wreck the fillet - - There's an overhang we've got to get into.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:41CST 142:48GET MC-562/4
142:48:00|CERNAN| back on the fresh1surface. These look like fragment breccias.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:50 CST 142:57 GET 563/1
142:57:00|SCHMITT|take it back on the fresh surface - these look like fragment breccias. Although the fragment size is very small1There are dark gray fragments and the light fragments we1talked about. The gray ones are very fine grain and dense; although I see flashes that indicate they may be crystalline1The light colored fragments are as I described them earlier, I think.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|514.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, if you could tear yourself away in the middle of that sometime you - to give us an EMU readout, we'd appreaciate it. We haven't gotten that from you yet on the EVA.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm standby, Gene's - got a rock to throw. That's from up higher -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, the first rock was from about a 514 was from1a meter above the base of the rocks - 5 15 from about a1meter and a half.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Can you get some on either side of those two now?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Am I in?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|that one.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, you're facing right into the east end. CE RN AN1Y up , y up .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|How about right where your (garble) is - yoah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's good.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|this it?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Got a bag.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy, that dust, once you get it one you get It on there you might as well forget it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:50 CST 142:57 GET 563/2
142:57:00|SCHMITT|494. 494 is from a half a meter above the base of the rock.
|CAPCOM|Understand 0.5 meters up.
|SCHMITT|And these are samples across the layering. These are samples from across the - Foliation. I missed that Bob .
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that now.
|SCHMITT|What do you think?
|SCHMITT|Can you get that - can you get that one up the re .
|CERNAN| other piece up here. Without busting my butt
|SCHMITT|Well, don't take any chances.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|How about this one?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's a good representative fragment. Canyougetit?
|SCHMITT|I can't reach you without my camera hitting.
|SCHMITT|that's a football size fragment.
|SCHMITT|Okay, this next sample - Can you get a bag out and we'll try to put it around it.
|SCHMITT|Around the end.
|SCHMITT|Bob, it's highly variable. This is a light matrix breccia whereas the other three fragments were dark matrix or dark fragment breccias. The big rock is a light matrix breccia with dark fragments and it's the one that has the halos around the light fragment and that's in 495, barely. It's not even in it. It's just 495 is wrapped aro un d i t .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's not going to stay, is it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's a football size fragmental rock.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Why don't you just dump it. See if you can dump it in there with that - with the bag down -
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it'll - we'll be able to identify it 495 when we get back.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Is the bag on it good.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that Gene, and you guys keeping tracks coming down to these boulders, Can you - do you have any feeling if you can place these that way?
|SCHMITT|Bob, unfortunately no, the main tracks are out in the Nansen and we, I don't think we can get over the re.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's those biggies that we seen on the left, huh?
|SCHMITT|But the visual (garble) - yeah, coming up I was looking and there are no obvious tracks coming down
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 19:50 CST 142:57 GET 563/3 down here.
142:57:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I'll get it. Wait a minute, that gnomon is probably not — well, that's right, you got stereo earlier.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the gnomon was moved a little between the s amples.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SCHMITT|Did you pick a vertical band?
|CERNAN| it off.
|SCHMITT|You getting a flight line? I'll get a flight line this way.
|SCHMITT|Post sample, flight line.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy, 42.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got a flight line on the North south trend, Gene got east-west.
|SCHMITT|You gonna get that sample under there?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|there might be an overhang. Look at that - that rock is fragmented, let's see, but it's east, it's southeast, northwest, there's a split.
|CERNAN| You want to get - hey did you want to get this?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I'll get that.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, and an update on the rake samples when you get around to it, we'd like to get one up on the Massif slope as much as you can. If you can get over to it. And then the second one down near the Rover.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay, Bob, this fillet is up underneath an overhang. I got it from about - -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's about -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, ah, a third of a meter under an overhang. And it's the upper three centimeters of soil.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Now let me get one out away from the overhang a little bit.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, you think that's permanent shadow?
|CERNAN| e as t.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 1950 CST 142:57 GET 563/4
142:57:00|SCHMITT|Okay, and a sample down to a depth of about 5 centimeters, about two thirds of a meter from the boulder, the south side, is in 497.
|CAPCOM|Copy that1.
|SCHMITT|Now let me get a skin sample, Geno.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| that, by the way. Show where they are.
|SCHMITT|I can feed them into my (garble) stereo.
|CERNAN| on those rocks.
|SCHMITT|Okay, about a centimeter deep skim.
|CERNAN| better come out.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Boy, that's hard on your hand even Ln 1/6-g, Okay, and that was -
|CERNAN| good spot for them to watch what's going on, I guess but that was the heading.
|SCHMITT|Ob shoot, they're missing all of it.
|CERNAN| all.
|CAPCOM|Every now and then we get a peek at you guys, but only every now and then.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's the way it happens.
|CAPCOM|(garble) sample bag number please.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I missed that, I didn't give it to you, but I think, the next bag I take out - you can check the num - well, wait a minute, I'll do it for you.
|CAPCOM|No, that's okay, I suspect it's 498.
|SCHMITT|I'm almost positive it was 498.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll put that down.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I did too.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, looking at the rock, directly down Sun, there are - the light gray matrix breccias, seem to be fragments or (garble) anyway within the white matrix b re cci as.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|SCHMITT|And I got a couple pictures down Sun to show that texture.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and one thing we'd like to do would be to sample a variety of blocks in terms of looking at differences in the blocks. From block to block.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 20:00 GET 143:06 564/1
143:06:00|CERNAN| ?— after a gray - I mean a lighter colored block, now. Are you going up there? SHMITT1Yes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and if you're going up the massif why don't we try and get the rake sample up there now when you finish these rocks.
|CERNAN| bring the rake. It's a long trip. No since coming up here twice. I can go get this sample. I'd get the rake if I were you - don't walk back up twice.
|SCHMITT|Well, I'm not sure there is any gain in anything by coming up to the top.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're not going to gain a thing, Bob -
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|- you're still on the talus, you guys.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the rims of the small craters in the talus are softer than the normal terrain. My foot goes in -maybe 10 centimeters where it normally only goes in a centimeter.
|CAPCOM|Okay, as long (garble) we'don't have to get very far up the slope.
|SCHMITT|that's right.
|CAPCOM|And Jack if you're back at the rover how about giving us a grav reading when you - before you leave.
|SCHMITT|Because I'm late sampling that's why, but I'll do it anyway.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Okay 6 70 155 201 670 155 201.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that, Jack. Press on.
|CERNAN| slope here it's - looks quite similar to the one we just sampled except there is a lot of flake fractures on it. Nonuniform, nondirectional, but quite - quite different at least on that other rock in terms of the fracture pattern. The texture looks to be quite similar. Boy, I'm glad I don't have to walk to the top of this thing.
|SCHMITT|Hey, look Gene on these rack samples. There is just no point in carrying a rack all the way up he re .
|CAPCOM|Negative, Jack as long as you're above the break -
|SCHMITT|All we needed was a break in the slope.
|CAPCOM|As long as your above the break in the slope that's right.
|SCHMITT|Well, that's all right It's being done, but let's watch those kind of calls please.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 20:00 GET 143:06 564/2
143:06:00|CERNAN| ____going up this slope, though. We can - we've got to tell them tha t.
|SCHMITT|Well, we'did.
|CAPCOM|Yes, that's what we were saying don't go above just at the base of the break in the slope, Jack. Don't climb all the way up there with it.
|SCHMITT|Oh, relax. Okay, we're all set, Bob no problem. We can.
|CERNAN| because it's probably shedding.
|SCHMITT|Hey, that's a different rock, Gene.
|CERNAN| it's got that flaky fracture pattern all over it. I'm going to get a stereo while I'm at it. Yes. This ought to cover any samples I take off of that thing. I'm going to get myself a zap of cold water.
|SCHMITT|Man, we've got to be a million miles away from the LM1.
|CERNAN| It's got nice white halos around the zap pits. The zap is -the zaps are not dense black black but a dark greenish, very dark greenish grey.
|SCHMITT|Are those halos or fragments?
|CERNAN| fragments, I think, also. But right now it's fairly crystalline but it is heterogenous matter of fact, there's a big fragment of porphyry caught up in this thing I think.
|SCHMITT|Do you have a locator, by chance. I haven't got a thing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we gotta get some of that.
|CERNAN| going right now. And there's a chunk there we can get.
|SCHMITT|that's a big fragment within this crystal line rock.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Inclusion.
|CERNAN| locate 'er I'll get it.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead, I've got it.
|SCHMITT|Got it?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It looks like an after site porphyry that's what it looks like. The border has got the very large crystals in there. They're very - they're very reflective elongated crystals.
|SCHMITT|It's a relatively angular inclusion about, it's about a half a meter in size and it's a square cross section. Well, it's irregular, but generally square a cross section. It's in bag 516 and it looks like a, well it's a high belt bar rock. It may be anorthositic gabbro but it is, it does look like a porphyry.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 20:00 GET 143:06 564/3
143:06:00|CERNAN| can't get it out though, it's buried in a rock, a very, oh half an inch, elongated, I can't see whether they are colorless or not, but they are certainly reflective crystals.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. And in the big rock you've got massive things like this big, this big fragment here that's 5 inches across.
|SCHMITT|Well, that maybe a small point, Gene, that's a lighter a color in general because of a zap or something.
|CERNAN| samples of it.
|SCHMITT|We need to get some of the host rock he re.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, now, you're still sampling the - one we just got.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| of that rock looks very much, looks like it might be finer grain, but it's about the same in 517. That's the contact in the inclusion side of the contact, of the contact.
|SCHMITT|Keep going after the other one, Gene, I'll get this thing there. They're bagged.
|CERNAN| if you look over this way, we're high enough.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we saw it, Geno, quite a sight - quite a goodie.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| There it is. Okay, the host rock for the inclusion which appears also to be crystalline, but may be a re crystaliized rock of some kind -
|SCHMITT|Can't see it to well.
|CERNAN| clase anyway, that's in bag 518 and that was a loose frag, fairly loose but in place, fragments along the fracture zone .
|CAPCOM|Okay, uh -
|SCHMITT|Just a minute, I'm going to try to get the rest of it up there.
|CAPCOM|Gkay, 17, and for your thinking, in a few minutes you might, also the back room raises about taking 10 minutes out station 4 and adding it into this station, giving the wealth of interest that seems to be occurring here. You might think about that. You never have been to station 4 and it's to hard to judge but if you think 10 minutes could be a very profitable spent you might as well do that. . !
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 20:00 GET 143:06 MC 564/4
143:06:00|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, we'll think about it. This is a medium green anorthotitic gabbro and it looks like it has some pastel green aldine crystals in it. Did you get it.
|CAPCOM|We copy that.
|CERNAN| there, I can't reach any more.
|SCHMITT|Qkay, and that small chip of that is 519, it's the same host rock, much like the previous sample.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, and another chunk of the host -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I've got it. ,
|CERNAN| in there. I haven't closed your bag yet, and we've got to one soil sample up for show here.
|SCHMITT|Oh, we'didn't get the rake, we ought to get a soil sample, though, up here, it's -
|CERNAN| here on this slope. Where does this thing go, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Right here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, was that last sample in 518 as W 6 11 
|SCHMITT|there it is. That's it right there.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 143:16 CST 20:10 MC 565/1
143:16:00|SCHMITT|No, we haven't put it in yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Bob, that will go in 499.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|You get it?
|SCHMITT|Okay. Bob this is a very uniform looking rock. It does have some widely spaced fractures across it. Clearly crystalline, it has crystalline inclusions in it.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| Both rocks looks like they might be in the anorthositic class -
|SCHMITT|Your bag is still open part way too.
|CERNAN| appears to be poorer finer grain matrix. Looks like a porphyry in the boulder.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and a reminder as you photograph it, remember that photograph in the southwest quandrant there will be best ones around the corner on two sides there will be the best one to show the structure through the whole rock.
|SCHMITT|Yes sir. On the southwest - south and west.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|. South and west.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Now west's in shade. You mean the -
|CAPCOM|Southwest -
|SCHMITT|South and east.
|CAPCOM|Roger the southwest base or pace is not quite south.
|CERNAN| stereo around here. Hey Jack, you can get way under there - I know you can get soil, I don't know how long it's been shadowed but its been shadowed as long as this rocks been here.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll do that.
|CERNAN| one. I've already got it.
|SCHMITT|Well I'm getting it from this way and they like that. Did we kick any dirt under there?
|CERNAN| down in there. Let me get a couple of after pictures. Now we want to get 2 sides of these rocks and you can see their structure.
|SCHMITT|I've got that, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I took those. I took that stereo.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'd like to remind you guys to get a p an from there before you leave th e hi gh uphill area here. There's no point in climbing up there twice remember.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you got your bag?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 143:16 CST 20:10 MC 565/2
143:16:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we got 12 or 13 minutes left at this station unless you take that extra 10 minutes that we were offering you.
|CERNAN| Let's take it - we'll -
|SCHMITT|Okay. Let me try again.
|CERNAN|
|PAO|That's the Earth in the picture.
|SCHMITT|(Garbled).
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I got in a - I got under a east-west overhang about 20 centimeters — way back — by the way then I — it goes even farther but that's about as far as I can reach back there now.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And 17, if you want to take a minute, you might look up in the sky and notice our camera is taking a beautiful picture of Mother Earth.
|CERNAN| Mass if too?
|CAPCOM|Now we're coming down to look at the Massif. Isn't that a beautiful picture, of the Pacific, Ed finally found it. Now we see the Massif.
|CERNAN| where Jack just got that soil sample under the rock from and I'm on 6 0.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Is that a gnomon?1.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll set it up for the rake.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. You get that pan -
|CAPCOM|I - didn't get that soil bag number, Gene - Jack.
|CERNAN|

|SCHMITT|It's in the (garbled).
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got to get out of my shadow. I can't see what I'm1doing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got to get it first.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, I say we can meet our walk back in space if anyone's interested.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I expect it's all down hill from here.
|SCHMITT|Well, no sir. Not exactly.
|CAPCOM|You guys see the LM or are you down too far to see the LM.
|SCHMITT|(Garbled). Oh, no the LM is over about 3 rises in the scarp1before we can even see it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I thought that might have happened.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. We had a feeling for that. I'm just che ckin g.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Not many small walnut sized fragments in here Bob. Gotten1about 7 or 8.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I copy that.
|SCHMITT|Gene, you got a.bag?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|How you doing? My hands are getting tired.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, there isn't a lot, but that'll fill up a b ag.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll have to look, I think so. I think they all are, aren't they?.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let's see, let me look. They want it -
|CERNAN| but we'did. Okay, my pan's by the way. I got extensive vertical coverage down into Nansen, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene. Thank you.
|CERNAN| drive here.
|SCHMITT|Maybe time's different in space. Adventures in space and time.
|CERNAN| whether that makes us over or not but -
|SCHMITT|Oo ops -
|CERNAN|

|SCHMITT|It's all right. I can't feel it. You might as well -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Coolings fine. My hands are tired.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and guys, if you see any more different rocks that are worth sampling before you get down on to the flats and sample the light mantle.
|SCHMITT|We haven't had a chance to look around any more than you heard.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|We want a rake and a light mantle. You might as well get that down by the Rover later on and -
|SCHMITT|Get it after - get it after, Gene. Gene, get it afte r.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Then you might look around - there were a couple of documented samples there -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|- up close to the slope of the massif before you move down the flatter light mantle areas by the Rover. Just do the other sampling.
|CERNAN| on the rake and I got the after.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 143:26 CST 20:19 MC 566/2
143:26:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we have that.
|CERNAN| a meter or two in diameter, and one is the anorthositic gabbro if I can use the term, and the other is - is that two-cycle breccia.
|SCHMITT|Just don't stub your toe.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey, Gene set up right there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Set up right there. Let's get that - let's get that big clast. There's a fran - a fracture I want to get ne ar.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Big white clast.in the gray matrix fracture.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Man, that's a prize. Let me get this over here so I can -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I can get both sides. I want to get this big - yeah, I think I can get that. I'm going to try. Oh, I can't believe the trouble I have with F stops. Okay. I'm going to try to take this piece off first.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that boulder's going to roll.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|there's the same clast over there. Well, we get that clast is soft.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Yeah, let me get that little piece, anyway, to start with. Got it. There's two more pieces.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Before we cover them up, let's get them.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, there you go. The other one's right the re .
|CERNAN| a s ample -
|SCHMITT|Want to try to hit that one more time - I think we've got another one coming there. There's another little one.
|CERNAN| I don't believe it, though.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think that's it. Got a bag?
|CERNAN| white clast in the gray breccia and it's mixed with soil - we had to pick up a little soil. 503.
|SCHMITT|I guess they're all there, aren't they?
|CERNAN| anyway, or three fragments that we got off - chips. Let me get a piece of the rock it's in and I'm going to take a closeup stereo of that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12J72 GET 143:26 CST 20:19 MC 566/3

|SCHMITT|I tried to catch it.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, still there listening with great de li gh t.

|CERNAN|
|PAO|Heart rate is running in the 90s,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What? The Bag?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No. Just the scoop - just like sugar -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I wore my hand out holding that camera to gether coming up here.
|CERNAN| a far and after I want to get some closeup stereos of that. I want to get some pictures around this block, too.
|SCHMITT|Okay. (garble).
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|take a closeup stereo around it. That oughta do it.
|CERNAN| good example of big bottom crater up there even on this shallow slope. I'll try to take a stereo of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, that sounds great. I guess there's always a problem of getting the in place clast if you think that's appropriate at this point. Word along those lines, though. We'd like your Rover moving in 11 minutes so it's probably not appropriate at this time on that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, there isn't any clast in this - this crate r.
|CAPCOM|(garble)
|SCHMITT|It's just bigger - it's bigger than the average crater and it still has that pit depicting about a third of the diameter of the inner diameter of the crater - third of the - make it a fourth of the rim diameter, that's easier.
|CAPCOM|I'll copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Look at what?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 143:26 CST 2019 MC 566/4
143:26:00|CERNAN| 1in how many minutes, Bob?
|CAPCOM|We'd like to have you moving in 10 minutes which means allow about the usual 3 or 4 or 5 minutes for closeout before that time.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, that white colored inclusion we sampled looks like a strange -
|CAPCOM|Yeah, sure. It's the old boulder rolling tri ck.
|SCHMITT|I was getting a soil sample under there.
|CAPCOM|Don't hit the Rover.
|CERNAN| under that rock.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, okay. Got a bag?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the soil from right underneath the rock down to about 4 centimeters and 505, and I'll try to skim it here a little bit, too. Get the upper parameter.
|CERNAN| sure they're not - they're not so some smaller ones in some of those other big boulders. That's just an intuitive guess.
|SCHMITT|Oh, they are.
|CERNAN| gross as this one. Such as this particular boulder I photographed, I had three of them other than the one we sampled. And that's 505 and 506 in that order.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 20:29 CST 143:36 GET 567/1
143:36:00|CAPCOM|Standby now. Probably the best thing for you guys - -
|SCHMITT|Bob, that rock - -
|CAPCOM|- - to do is to go back to the Rover and pick up the rake samples. Go ahead, Jack.
|SCHMITT|that -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. That clast, white clast, I looked at it, and it has a light pastel green, fairly rounded crystals in a fine grain white, light pinkish-ta.n matrix. And you can figure that one out. Look like olivine and something.
|CAPCOM|Roger on that. Sounds like a rainbow.
|SCHMITT|It might be a - no, the colors aren't that distinct, Bob. I was just giving you shades.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Roger.
|CERNAN| rock that's oh, 30 or 40 meters from us to give you an idea of the kind of upslope filleting you have on some of those boulde rs.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll -
|SCHMITT|It's down to your right.
|CAPCOM|We'll send Ed over there to look atit.</h5>
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I'll help him. I don't think you got enough time.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like you guys to get going on the rake sample we like a handle on the rake there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm gonna have to move out here a w ays, Gen o .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Right there is what I'm looking at.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're gonna check it out, thank you.
|SCHMITT|And there's no sense trying to get 500's up well - -
|SCHMITT|Let's see what happens.
|CAPCOM|Also, we're running out of - there's no time to get 500 meters, unfortunately, we're planning on station 4 which will be a better perspective distance any how.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I was going to say, there's no sense in trying to get them up the Massif, I don't think you'll see any th in g up the re .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Gene, you getting your pan?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, right over there where there's some fragments. And you get the -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, and then I'll get the down.
|SCHMITT|OUay. (garble)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me tell you, you just got to think an order of magnitude bigger than what you normally are accustomed to thinking. Okay, pan's complete, let's get the rake sample so we can move on.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 20:29 CST 143:36 GET 567/2

|CAPCOM|Okay, no, we're definitely not in favor of that, Gene, at this end.

|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Boy I tell you.
|CERNAN| little bit.
|SCHMITT|Well, it's all right, there just aren't any rocks. Should have brought the scoop and used the old shovel trick. There's a couple, keep going.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, do you have any feeling - do you have that hard layer underneath there like you did yesterday when you raked at station 1?
|SCHMITT|there's one under the gnomon you can get.
|CERNAN| to be clods.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's what most of them are is clods. How do you get clods if it's never been wet?

|CERNAN| this stuff there's some light - well I can't see it now, I'm looking in - -
|SCHMITT|I can see there's a light colored fragment I think we break into.
|CERNAN| clods. And when I was walking uphill I really wasn't expecting probably more than an inch or two.
|SCHMITT|Why don't you - can you - want to take this bag off me?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll get one out. We can use this one. Yeah, cause we want to get rolling.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, there's a couple of things here, while your getting undone there. (There's our housekeeping to close out, change those bags we'd also like to get the set turned on and you might read us the temperature when you turn it on. And other than that stowing the TV and low gain antenna and you're on your way. You've taken care of the gravimeter already.

143:45:00|CERNAN| there, they were about the two varieties we saw in the area are it's a long extrapolation I realize but they do resemble in color and I believe in texture the blue gray rocks and the light tan rocks, upon the Massif, so I feel confident that - very confident that we sampled at least the two major units visible from a distance in the South Massif.
|CAPCOM|Excellent, excellent.
|CERNAN| mission work to be done on correlating the angularity and possibly even albedos of the rocks we sampled with those on the Massif. We should have good - good pictures of them - of both from a distance and up close.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'm reminding you that extrapolation is the nature of our art. SC HM ITT1Hahahahahaha, an d Bob, I i not going to - how am I on the film?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by. I'll get that for you, Jack. I can see you fairly well now. And before you guys get too far, a couple of comments we want to do on the way if there is a Rover sample stop in your checklist it used to be at the 073 and 6.3 it s the first thing there, half way out to hole in the wall. And we're now going to have that Rover sample stop at 078 and 7.0. That should be along your tracks going home. So about 078 /.U we'll have the Rover sample stop and the gravimeter people have won today and we're going to stop and get off the Rover and get a gravimeter reading in that location. We re taking out t is ot er stop, I'm not sure quite where. And right now, Jack, you re right on the film says a little note in front' of me.

|SCHMITT|that's beautiful.
|CERNAN| mysterious looking place. They can cut some frames - some parts of those pictures out and make a nice photograph. (Laughter) TV cameras, maps -
|SCHMITT|Okay, looking at the north (garble) the light mantle. No more comments except that by that rake sample and just looking there's certainly - are fewer fragments than we saw on station 2. The main thing that we can tell about the light mantle and when we're on it of course, is the light colored craters. The fresher craters all appear to be light colored and as they get older they seem to the albedo goes down and potentially have been dusted with material from the dark mantle or from other sites. Either that or it's just the lunar patination that we're all familiar with.
|CERNAN| TV coming down here because my heading isn't going to change much at all. The high gain could have been on the whole time.
|SCHMITT|Bob, none of the craters out here in the light mantle appear to show - they've got good bedrock. Almost all of them are instant rock crater.

|CAPCOM|Guys, we're ready for the gravimeter reading. And we'd like a frame count from you, Jack. Would you - (garbled)
|SCHMITT|A chunk of yellow-brown rock that apparently has several spots behind it, probably indicating direction from which it came — oh, no — what is that That's a reflection (laughter) That really fooled me. A reflection off the Mylar (laughter) Baby. Well, what the heck - I'll sample it anyway.
|CERNAN| not quite -(
|SCHMITT|Is it through reading?
|CERNAN| Probably read it better by now, Bob. I've got Stanley mountain and some of the hills way up to the right of Stanley Mountain. I'm at 67 on the 500 and I'll give you the reading on the gravimet er.-
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy. 67 on Stanley Mountain.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy them all.
|CERNAN| 90 degree low gain angle.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we've been reading them on the LM also.
|SCHMITT|(garbled) Easy, here's another small fragment. You1know what I need —
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Geno, and we're ready for you guys to go1on the earliest convenience.
|SCHMITT|Do you want me to load the LRV sampler?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Jack is that you last LRV sample bags?
|SCHMITT|I only had one left but its loaded now.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|

|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and if you've got something - if you don't have one left for that sample at hole in' the wall Jack,1we'd like you to get a new set of sample bags.
|SCHMITT|SE." IV,I U.till. Unde rs t and that 32 Echo was your last sample.

|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Need some help.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Was that me?
|SCHMITT|that was interesting Bob about 2 inches below the surface here you ran into that very t at grey material1down there and it just - its in little cl and it breaks1apart in your hands.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Did you get some of that in your Rover SaoPl
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let's grab a quick Rover sample and we'll take CERSAH1That'S why that was a pretty interesting epiSo
|SCHMITT|Yeah, well you know we haven't been trenching like we should.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 20:55 GET 144:03 MC 570/1
144:03:00|CERNAN| ing like we should or we would have -
|SCHMITT|But, really those trenches, those creaters, are giving us the same information, that there's a light colored material underneath.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, we're ready for you guys to move on and we'd like to eliminate the Rover sample and hole on the wall.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And I understand that these Rover samples, Jack, are in your pockets.
|SCHMITT|No, they're in the bag on the Rover.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|40 Yankee.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|that's light colored soil from a depth of about, it's mixed with a little of the upper surface, but mostly light colored soil from a depth of about 15 centirmeters.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It looks like the light mantle in here is covered with dark to a depth of about 5 or 10 centirmeters.
|CERNAN| your diverter.
|SCHMITT|Right now I'm sort of warm.
|CERNAN| wan t to.
|SCHMITT|I'm going to DET myself with a cold. I can do it on here .
|CERNAN| we we re there .
|SCHMITT|Oh yeah, I didn't take a pan. Why don't you turn right to CRAV.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, mark that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Left. Let me see where we're going, I guess (garble) In a little more and that hole would have been in the way. We left some of our litter.
|CERNAN| location. Okay, L & B frank out 8 0.
|CAPCOM|Copy that 8 0.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Geno, you're heading for a spot that about 0805 point 5 approximately.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yeah, you guys following a track form or not?
|SCHMITT|Do you have an update?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Roger, the hole in the wall should be at about 080 or maybe 5 point 7 and we're not going to stop and get a Rover sample at hole in the wall.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 20:55 GET 144:03 MC 570/2
144:03:00|CERNAN| *just nothing but just lots of rolling terrain.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I - I think we have a good sample of only partially contaminated light mantle in that last Rover sample that Gene accidentally discovered was right under our feet. It's almost certainly the light colored material is the grey that we've been talking about in the walls of the crater and as a matter of fact, that instant rock sample I took was light colored and probably represents the same stuff inderated slightly.
|SCHMITT|Light colored mantle has that bluish tint that you saw in those rocks.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I still don't think there's anything we oughta - we oughta get a core in this light mantle sometime, and probably station 3 is going to be the place. I hope that's still in the agenda.
|CAPCOM|Rog, it's still in the agenda.
|CERNAN| on station 3.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you want mileage to it or do you want the range and bearing added.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're going to say about 0 89 and 6741 for station 3.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Do I get another range and bearing right now?
|CERNAN| only ones out here, Jack. Look on the right - 073 10 point 3 6 point 6.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I have a feeling that what ever darkens the - ooh, there's a beautiful little black line crater, uh, dead bottom crater - whatever darkens the light mantle is not a - a one time only mantling of darker material. It's something that happens over a period of time, continually, because craters of all sizes and apparent degradation are darkened and there are lighter craters that are light to varying degrees, there seems to be a continuing - continuum of albedo change. You know that little crater on the side of the North Massif that we're thinking about going to doesn't look nearly as light colored or haloed as it does in pictures, does it.
|CERNAN| where we are, I don't want to run into that big crater at the foot of the -
|SCHMITT|I think you're almost to the ramp.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 20:55 GET 144:03 MC 570/3
144:03:00|CERNAN| my tracks are over there to the left, I haven't crossed them yet.
|SCHMITT|073 6 point 3.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|L&B frame count is 86.
|CAPCOM|Copy 86.
|SCHMITT|Boy, that's a sight, isn't it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't know why something that's all approximately the same hue should - the lack of color has got to contribute to the inability to judge distance.
|SCHMITT|See the lobes coming up - looks like lobes out from the scarp. The scarp rather being a line in there on the, on the plain, appear to be lobes.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Whereas when it gets up on the Massif it's a fairly contineous curve, although it does appear to be younger at least, at least there's less relief on it for the first 2 killimeters of that bend there.
|CERNAN| the way we came because there's that big crater down at the bottom, I'm afraid.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I think we agree with that suggestion, too.
|SCHMITT|Bob, the scarp, so called scarp, impresses me as less of a scarp than a series of, of lobes which roughly have a north south trend and we've been driving over various hummocks within those lobes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| not trying to learn good TV, my heading hasn't changed much at all here .
|SCHMITT|then we would have a spectacular view.
|CERNAN| now -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 144:11 CST 2105 JC 571/1
144:11:00|CERNAN| down in that valley, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Good Lord, I still don't know where the LM is - I see it, I think. The shadow or blob - that's the only sharp shadow out there right in the - because you sure can't make out the craters from here, can you?
|CERNAN| rail. Man, I tell you, this machine is fantastic1j
|SCHMITT|Yep, Roger1j
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Likes to spin when you turn going down hill.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Watch It, I think you've got something right ahead of you. Here - see the instant rock.
|CERNAN| look nearly as bad from here but it sure is deep when you get up there. We'll just - I'll meander around its over next to the (garble) then I'll head down the next one - the first one we came up - and then along it,
|SCHMITT|Okay, there's Lara, and I think we can see station - Watch it, watch it, watch it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I figured we'd buckle the LCRU with that one.
|CERNAN| rate just dictates the kind of terrain we're going over.
|SCHMITT|Houston, we're navigating and not talking. Sorry. But the light mantle is a fair - is a uniform surface and I think you've heard just about everything we've had to say, so far.
|CAPCOM|Roger, your COMM1s great and you guys are doing good work.
|SCHMITT|the fragment population is not - the frag ment population has not changed, nor has the crater population, as near as I can tell. I hope the LRV photos will give you more details on that. Okay, Gene, do you have the target over there, that set of -
|CERNAN| and I'm going to be off the scarp.
|SCHMITT|We're about three quarters of the way down.
|PAO|Heart rates while on the Rover are in the 80s .
|CERNAN| the only sharp shadow out there. Right under the sun, straight down there,
|SCHMITT|Probably.
|CERNAN| Just hold on.
|SCHMITT|this is what?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, there's Nemo over there to my right.
|CERNAN| Would you believe that?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 144:11 CST 2105 MC 571/2
144:11:00|SCHMITT|Well, I don't know.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the problem is if there is any crater on the side -
|CERNAN| you -
|SCHMITT|I think you're all right.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Keep your speed down because if you have to turn, it doesn't like it on a downhill slope.
|CERNAN| and I don't know what that means. Okay. Right on time.
|SCHMITT|(garble)
|CAPCOM|You guys cut each other out but I take it that means you're at the edge of the scarp.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, you're down the scarp.
|CERNAN| fast as we went up?
|SCHMITT|I'd rather not. Oh, I don't know, I'm impressed.
|CERNAN| And we want to go to dua1 876.1 -
|SCHMITT|Okay, you're - I think you're headed right - right for where we want.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's that bright - see that bright crater? You can just start to see station 3 over there now.
|CERNAN| I should be increasing range. Bob, we're at 07911.5 and 5.7.
|CAPCOM|Okay, beautiful, guys. Really going smooth.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. In fact, we understand it's been going so smooth down here that they haven't even spilled any coffee in the span room yet this mission.
|SCHMITT|It ought to be.
|CERNAN| don't have any sitting on the LCRU.
|SCHMITT|Right over there is station 3, I think.
|CERNAN| there - I'm just trying to see two craters -
|SCHMITT|You know what the problem is?
|CERNAN| planner view of the highgate and I can't see a thing out there.
|SCHMITT|that's right.
|CERNAN| underneath it.
|SCHMITT|Well I - gonna take it broadside.
|CERNAN| I'm out in front. Oh, I guess I can see them both.
|SCHMITT|Here's a nice sharp little hole, look at that. Bob, the texture of the light mantle - surface texture - Is really no different on the scarp on it's flank or out here to the east of the scarp. Fragment population, crater population, everything looking about the same. If there is such a thing as a light mantle, it seems to be uniform across the scarp.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 144:11 CST 2105 MC 571/3
144:11:00|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Hey, your tracks - we crossed somebody's tracks - we sure did - we made a loop.
|CAPCOM|Hope they look like yours1.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy 081 5.7. Do they look like your tracks?
|SCHMITT|Here's another set.
|CERNAN| crater and I came southeast in order to get around it, remember? We saw that hole?
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN| was a quick change of mind when we came over that ridge.
|SCHMITT|Yes sir.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Here - I —
|CERNAN| a hangle on yet is what are the - I think we sampled them -once in a Rover sample, but what are the fragments out here mixed with the light mantle?
|CAPCOM|Okay, 1 copy that.
|SCHMITT|I think I got one in our last - our last gravimeter stop, a small one, aqd I guess there's one other Rover sample, but - station 3, we probably ought to make sure we get a representative suite of those fragments.
|CAPCOM|Roger, agree to that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|How say there agin, Gene? How long have you been out ?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|3 plus 451.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We're at 0835.7, Well, it certainly doesn't look like the geology of Norway, but it certainly is interesting.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| her.
|SCHMITT|that's right. I told them about those earlier. That's the only - no, I think, Gene, you want to bear a little bit - hold on - a little bit to the left. See those two craters, two bright craters, that are just this side of Lara?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're pointed right - almost right at them, now.
|CERNAN| that high gain.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 144:11 CST 2105 MC 571/4
144:11:00|SCHMITT|Okay. .
|CERNAN| now.
|SCHMITT|those are the two I think they wanted us to be at and I think that's a good choice if we can get up there.
|CERNAN| scarp flows up on1top - well, it looks like it flows up on top of the North Massif. Now it may look like the North Massif may drop material1down upon it. Look at that.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| It just doesn't look like as old a surface, but definitely different.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 144:21 CST 2115 MC 572/1
144:21:00|SCHMITT|Wish they had never said anything about pic tures because I've tended to not take enough - to do better.
|CAPCOM|Okay, but Jack, you're doing quite well in the picture department - you're not getting too far behind or ahead* Copy that, Gene?
|SCHMITT|I mean I'm not getting the coverage I've - I'm not sure I'm getting the coverage I should.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'll look at the frame count when you get to station 3.
|SCHMITT|Oops, oops, Oh, there's another big crater with a pit in it.
|CERNAN| hit coming down the scarp, Jack?
|SCHMITT|I don't -
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| and look at that (garble). Is that -
|SCHMITT|Yeah. I don't know where we're going to get a good - Well, let's see. You know, that big block up there might be worth going to.
|CERNAN| we got right here.
|SCHMITT|Well -
|CERNAN| see if we can get at that scarp over there.
|SCHMITT|I surely would have lost track -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|I think we expected you guys to be a little bit further north, we were getting a heading of 080 for the bearing which really kind of says you said you were going a bit further north than this.
|CERNAN| Jack.
|SCHMITT|080?
|CAPCOM|Roger. 080 is where we think -
|SCHMITT|All of a sudden I've lost track.
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|there's nothing wrong with that except that -
|SCHMITT|I think we ought to go back to that big block.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, I just realized that -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I realize that, Gene, my mistake. Somebody's got a wrong thing down here.
|SCHMITT|Gene, I think -
|CAPCOM|That's the Hole-In-The-Wall. My mistake.
|SCHMITT|I think we need to go back there a little bit.
|CERNAN| about right, why don't we stop here?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12772 GET 144:21 CST 21:15 MC 572/2
144:21:00|CAPCOM|Okay 17, that's a great stop. That was my mistake, I was reading the Hole-In-The-Wall coordinate.
|CERNAN| that are in the light mantle.
|CAPCOM|Okay, let me brief you on station 3. It's going to be a very brief station to make up for -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, it will be a brief station to make up for the time we added on at the - first of all remember we want to get the nav update. Let me go into a heading of 270 more or less and give us the nav readout so we can start that here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, this is no good. I wanted to get a high spot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Why. You should have stayed up there. This is good right here.
|CERNAN| gravimeter.
|CAPCOM|Gene, remember, we won't to first - head for the west so we can get the nav update.
|CERNAN| those blocks right up behind us. Okay, you want a nav update here ?
|SCHMITT|You need to get your antenna.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's affirmed.
|CERNAN| the wrong damn - oh, no I'm not. I'll get a nav update. Get off and look around. I'll give them a nav update, Jack, and we'll press on.
|SCHMITT|Yes, sir, you're right, Bob.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I will.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CERNAN| you need.
|SCHMITT|Oh, you're going to move?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| q ui ck .
|SCHMITT|Oh, I'm sorry, I -
|CAPCOM|Okay. And, Jack, straight for you. We're going to want you to do some document sampling on your own. I'll get with you guys on the rest of the station plans shortly. Go ahead, Gene, we're ready.
|CERNAN| Okay, let me find the little fellow and come back towards you.
|SCHMITT|I'll get it. There is none.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, go ahead, make your park.
|CERNAN| God, there sure aren't very many.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 144:21 CST 21:15 MC 572/3
144:21:00|SCHMITT|that's probably pretty good.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|(garble) to see all that level, Jack - Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got your gnomon.
|CERNAN| it over to read it. Pitch is — pitch is zero. Roll is zero. How about one left, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy. And how about that -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And how about headings?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead and park. We'll give you an update when you get done.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's all we need. Go ahead and park on your 045. We'll give you an update when you get done.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Looks like a pretty good location to sample the rim materials of this crater.
|CERNAN| southeast rim of a - oh a 30 meter crater in the light mantle, of course, up on the scarp and maybe 300 - 200 meters from the rim of Lara in the northeast direction.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|CERNAN| a bright crater on your map. There's only about a half a centimeter of gray cover over very white material that forms the rim.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene, give me a call when you get parked and I'll see if we get an update give you an update on what we want to do.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll take the Rover readout first. Okay, we'll take the Rover readout first.
|CERNAN| battery temps 100, 120, The rear motors are off scale low and the fore motors are 0 and 2 40.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. Understand that 240 now instead of a 340. And what was your heading, 045?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. We copy that.
|CERNAN| 340, I think it was erroneous.
|CAPCOM|Okay, roger. And what we'd like you to do, Gene is we'd like you to get the CSBC samples yourself, that will essentially be your sole task at this station, Jack can do the solo sampling and we'd like to get one pan with the gravimeter and then we'll leave this station. We're going to absorb some of the time we spent for the extra gravimeter reading and some of the time we absorbed at station 2 in the longer stay time in sampling at station 3. That's our plan. So it will be CDR for the CSBC for the long cans, excuse me and LMP for solo sampling and then a pan by Jack, I presume and then a gravimeter and then leave. And Jack, you might check your film. We aren't quite sure where you are right now before you get too far from the Rover.

|CERNAN| preference up in this area where you want that logged in?1;
|CAPCOM|Negative. That's something that was so near the scarp that you're parked pretty near the scarp and that something that when we'do it in solo, we only1; did it with the Rover, so you'd have to stay right there1j beside the Rover and do it. No expectations of doing it1' otherwise1.
|CERNAN| think you're in good shape. Yeah, I don't think we have any other choice. Matter of fact, if there is a scarp, and if it is a flat we're right on it because the projection of it would be up hill a little bit.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I'll be right on the side of it. I'm parked on the side of it if it exists.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, what's your frame Comm?
|SCHMITT|Well, 1, uh, 122.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that (garble) Go ahead, Gene.
|SCHMITT|What do you need, Gene?
|CERNAN| side of this crater. I've got downsun pictures of it. There is quite a marbling of light and dark soil or fine grain material. It looks as if there's a uniform about 3 centermeter layer of light material over that marbled light and dark. On the very top surface there's a half centermeter of light grey, when I say dark, I mean a medium grey.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Sounds like a great sample site.
|CERNAN| soils and then I'll get you the fragments.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I presume that we'll at least have the single upper core which we can use to sample that stuff In the soil and we -
|CERNAN| crater rim.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene are you still near the Rove r.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like to get the SEP blankets opened, Gene, and dusted if they're dirty, so they can cool some more.

|CAPCOM|Yeah.
|CERNAN| reading while I'm working on the Rover, so I'll have to time it when I get away from it.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, you got some there in that little pocket in that little pocket. Yeah, and there's so many bags in here, I can't get out. No I mean the pocket on the Rover on the back. Remember?

|CERNAN| could come off the camera. But they can. SERNAN1Yeah. Doggone it.
|SCHMITT|What's your problem?
|CERNAN| this bag - it's going to come off at the bottom if we'don't. It's not going to come off again I don't think. The harness is tight enough now.
|SCHMITT|Want to tighten the harness?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Let me get your harness - I might just as well do it so it's right. If it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing right.
|CERNAN| No, don't bend over, I can't get down there.
|SCHMITT|Okay.

|SCHMITT|they don't stay on my camera anymore.
|CERNAN| why they shouldn't according to this. But there are a lot -

|CERNAN| here all by itself on the light mantle - I got some pictures. It was at 0885.6.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|And it looked like a gray breccia, I'm not sure though, all I could see was the serpent texture, and it had the modular or elongated, modular texture that those breccias had up on the South Massif.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that Jack.
|CERNAN| temperatures are 100 and 130.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, as far as any of the things we talked about trying to see at the surface, dynamics or a variation of the light mantle, I think you've heard it all, there isn't much to say about the dynamics right now. I have a feeling that the surfaces are old enough that all those kind of detailed relationships have been obscured. Solenoid is just about the same all over here, it varies, but there are no systematics that I've seen.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Do we ever see a Rover flag come up when you've got high temperatures there on the battery - have you seen the flag up yet?

|CERNAN| I'm 0905.3 now Bob. We're heading toward your stop.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 0905.3.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I couldn't tell whether that was just it looked like that might have been a crater that it got to bedrock, it may have been a high point or let's say a thin point in the light mantle, and it got down to bedrock, but I can't. It's the most blocky rimmed crater we've seen for a long time.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It was about 15 meters in diameter.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 22:01 GET 145:08 577/3
145:08:00|SCHMITT|Bob, I thought the purpose was to sample the light mantle?
|CAPCOM|I was - talked to them about that, but they -
|SCHMITT|We sampled the light mantle at that last one.
|CAPCOM|I agree, I talked to them about that, but they are so anxious to get to station 4, I guess they don't want to do it.
|SCHMITT|Well, how about it Gene, a little real time -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think we got it.

|CERNAN| down this slope1I don't see Shorty though, do you?
|SCHMITT|Wait a minute, is that it? Is that it out there straight ahead?

|CERNAN| right across here, that's going to be about the right place.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, I forgot to take the pictures again, trying to shade my eyes.
|CERNAN| there by Hanover.
|SCHMITT|Just rolls over the side, doesn't it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't know what else we can say about it though. Okay we're getting a good view of the North Massif,and the cross hatched lineaments which Gene has talked about are over there also, there seems to be a set that plunge about oh 30 degrees to the east and another set that plung the same to the west. Plus the boulder tracks which we see occasionally over there and there are areas of boulder fields up on the Massif itself such as we saw on the South Massif. As a matter of fact, it looks like there's one just above where we may - where Station VI may be; straight ahead of us there Geno.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|About bearing 060 from our present position which is 098 and 4.8.
|CERNAN| on me.
|SCHMITT|I don't see any - anything like layering up there although the upper of those boulder fields on the North Massif, and as a matter of fact on South Massif -
|CERNAN| yeah, that's got to be it.
|SCHMITT|- all tend to have a linear boundary. That's the upper portion of the field; the lower portion is strung out down slope.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. We're at 9 - 099 4.7, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, great, sounds like you're just about th e re .
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I think we got it in front of us.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Bob, looking at the Sculptured Hills, I think Gene's comment the other day about Bear Mountain would apply. There's a small relief - or small amplitude hummocking this to the surface, it's formed by a cross hatch of let's say the slope I'm looking at is sort of a west—facing slope so on the other side of Wessex Cleft it's formed by lineaments going plunging about 10 degrees to the north and about 10 degrees to the south. The combination gives some hummochs that are quite "    distinct.

|CERNAN| on this low saddle here, 045 will give them a good heading.
|SCHMITT|Shorty is a crater the size of which you know. It's obviously darker rimmed although the fragment population for most of the blanket does not seem too different than the light mantle, but inside -

|CAPCOM|Copy that. And did I understand 4.2 on the range, Gene?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Sounds like an interesting crater in any case.

145:17:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Wait until you see the bottom of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Houston, Shorty is clearly a darker rimmed crater. The inner wall is quite blocky over - but except for the western portion of it which is less blocky than the others, the floor is hummocky as we thought it was in the photograph. The central peak if you will, or central mound is very blocky and jagged, and the impression I have of the other mounds in the bottom is that they may - they look like swamp masses that may have come off the side.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that and -
|SCHMITT|- that's just what they look like, I'm not sure that - they have - they have a bench appearance.
|CAPCOM|Okay and the primary priority, number 1 and 2 priorities at this station will be samples from the crater rim and the pan from the crater rim, over.
|SCHMITT|Okay, we've got a large boulder of very in tensely fractured rock, right on the rim, right near the rover. It looks like - it looks like a finely vesicular version of our clinopyroxene gabbro. It's obviously crystalline, and has generally that same appearance. There is in one spot here some inclusions of a darker grey rock also intensely fractured. The fracture systems I think will show up well in the flight line stereo. Bob, do you have TV?
|CAPCOM|Rog, we have TV and you might brush the lens for us before you run away.
|CERNAN| battery covers cleaned.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to take a pan while I'm waiting for you.
|CAPCOM|And we're going to want the sep opened and dusted as well here so we'll be completely turned off.
|SCHMITT|Okay, okay. Oh hey.
|CERNAN| been fooled once.
|SCHMITT|there is orange soil.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's all over, orange.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I stirred it up with my feet.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's orange.
|CERNAN| still orange.
|SCHMITT|Sure is. Crazy. Orange.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that, I guess we'd better work fast.
|SCHMITT|He's not going out of his wits, it really is.

|SCHMITT|(GARBLE) itself is about 100. (GARBLE) about 102. It's almost the same color as the LMP decal on my camera.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy this brush is getting harder to get on and off too, but I sure don't want to lose it. Hey I may start putting that under my feet.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay the stuff has been dusted. I think I gave you 102 or something like that.
|CERNAN| Hey, you can see this in your color television I bet you.
|SCHMITT|I didn't think there would be orange soil on the moon.
|CERNAN| looks just like1a - an oxidized desert soil, that's exactly right.
|PAO|Total stay time here 30 minutes.
|SCHMITT|Well, I'm going to clean their glasses so they don't - so1they know where - can you wait a minute on that pan you're taking?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I mean the television camera, I 11 put you back where I had you.
|CERNAN| finished your pan. You know - that orange - that orange is along a line, Geno, along the rim crest - to follow what -ci rcumferen ti al?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| say it. But if there ever was something that looked like a fumeral eleration this is it. Okay, now let me give you a gra- vi me te r , MARK it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, mark the gravimeter.
|SCHMITT|And C is flashing.
|CERNAN| standby. I've got to get my gonomon1(
|SCHMITT|Hey, I think we hit one of those things we ve got to reconsider on, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, the problem is we're looking at foot constraints right now as luck would have it of course.

|SCHMITT|GARBLE rock up there that's GARBLE.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, let's start sampling that trench. We've got t o get it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Look at where the contact between the gray an d th e -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey, can you get a downsun? I think your color will be best downsun.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Go to Fll. Get a little bit closer, Geno, if you think you're minimum.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Here you go.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by they're debating that right now.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, let's get the short can in some of that and -
|CERNAN| first, then we'll1get it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Go back and get that one.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll go get a new shot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You've got to slow down there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I can't see into this.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Can you get around on the other side.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Cause I can't see the sample.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 22:21CST, 145:28GET, 579/3
145:28:00|SCHMITT|Oh, well, yeah, that's it. Need to get a sample right1across that contact too.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay bag that one.
|CERNAN| about 2 to 3 inches down.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're suggesting intermediate for you, Jack1. ,
|SCHMITT|Okay, the light grey which is on either side we sample the - the - let me get some more - let me have a little more - it's all it is getting mixed with - a little bit with a -about a half a centimeter thick light grey or medium gray covering over the whole area. Bob, the gray material that is adjacent to the red material is at five - how would I say five ten.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| intermediate.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| think - about1a meter. You can't get to the end of it - bottom of it though, can you?
|SCHMITT|I haven't been able to yet. Just to be sure why don't we sample this1side of it too.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay1one.
|CERNAN| did we put the small can?
|SCHMITT|It's in the - it's in bag 7 under my seat.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|511 has the gray from the other side of the orange band and the other side happens to be the crater side.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| 1111 get that can.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to see if this goes on down here as a zone. It looks like it's a ellipsoidal area if my foot print is any indication.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, we'd like to get the double core here instead of the small can - double core, please instead of the small can.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's affirm.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well if the vertical stratigraphy do you want to go sideways a1little with it? Or you just want to get it as deep as you can,1huh?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 22:21CST, 145:28GET, 579/4
145:28:00|CERNAN| we can on the orange please there, Jac,.
|CAPCOM|And the one problem at this station Jack is not that we can find a GARBLE station or other station is the fact that we're running up against the walkback constraints here and in just a very few minutes - about two zero minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 22:30 GET 145:37 MC-580/1
145:37:00|CAPCOM|One problem at this station Jack, is not that -
|SCHMITT|All right.
|CAPCOM|we (garble) station or any other stations The fact that we're running up against the walk-back constraints here and just a very few minutes about 20 minutes.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay, Bob and the bottom will be 44 and the top will be 35.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CAPCOM|And after the core, we'd like for you to go over and sample some of that — some of the big rocks there on the rim, if you could very quickly. That'll be the next order of priority after that.
|SCHMITT|We will, Houston.
|CAPCOM|And I'm not sure whether your pan will look down into the crater or not Jack. But if it didn't we'd like to get another one from there. Hey there's the crater.
|SCHMITT|It did. (garble) Yeah, look into it1, yourself and then I'll also get you a stereo pan before we leave. I can do that.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's some crater.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. I (garble) taken stereo pan with craters, without getting one here.
|CERNAN| So,.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I've used that right there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that right there.
|CERNAN| glass probably.
|SCHMITT|Boy, it sure is.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| about got to the upper edge of this little ellipsoid zone. I think we're going to have to — we've messed up most of it. Let's try right over here. I've got a little piece of glass in my p o ck e t.
|SCHMITT|Bob, the upper portion of the core is going to be a little bit disturbed, because, we've walked around the area so much.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|CERNAN| You may want to get up here -
|SCHMITT|A lot of black glass.
|CERNAN| I'll get a shot.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 22:30 GET 145:37 MC580/2 
145:37:00|SCHMITT|Get your picture.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. And 17, while you're doing that, was the grey mantle over the top of this or was it showing all the way through the surface?
|SCHMITT|No, it was over the top. It was about a half a centimeter over the top.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|He's getting about 3 centimeters of wax.
|CAPCOM|Very good.
|CERNAN| that double core was back there, I guess. Yeah, it's pretty hard. It acts like it's generally cohesive. It breaks up in angular fragments.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| has a crimson view, or red view. Outside of that it s orange. And outside of that it's grey. Pardon me Jack.
|SCHMITT|that's all right, take it easy. I'd offer to hit him, but I don't think I can my hands are so tired.
|CERNAN| or two.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, go ahead.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Have at it, he's still getting a centimeter a whack, poor guy.
|CERNAN| better get a locator. Oh it's in the, no it isn t.
|SCHMITT|the only thing I question is our ability to get it out.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Does it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, do I have core tubes on me now, I mean caps.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes sir.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, we'll give it the old college try.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 22:30 GET 145:37 MC-580/3
145:37:00|SCHMITT|Yeah, we ought to be good at getting cores out by now,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I was just getting this out for you. Let me - I can get this side better.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Ready.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Go.
|CERNAN| it all right. Let1me get a cap.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| '1Okay. Hold it - hold - let me get a cap.
|SCHMITT|All right get the cap.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Now wait a minute - Are you ready?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Even the core tube is red. Look at that, even the core is red. The bottom one's black, black and orange and the1top one grey and orange.
|CERNAN| it's filled with a1black material.
|SCHMITT|Let me see, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that might be a magnitite. I got it.
|CAPCOM|Fantastic, fantastic.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|God, it is black isn't it.
|CERNAN| Very black. Well not very black. It's a good dark grey. Dark bluish grey.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, in contrast.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Which way.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.

145:37:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|. (Laughter)
|CERNAN| this cap to come off. Okay, I'm going to intermediate cooling. Okay, now you don't have any caps so let's take this back to the Rover.
|SCHMITT|Here's the hole.
|CERNAN| hole, while you've got a camera there.
|SCHMITT|Be careful with that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|The caps are in SPB 7 there under the LMP (garble)
|SCHMITT|Well the hole's mostly - the hole's mostly in shadows.
|CAPCOM|And, 17 -
|SCHMITT|I got them Bob.
|CAPCOM|.17 for your spot - we'd like - we have to be leaving here - not like - we have to be leaving here in 14 minutes on the move because of walk back constraints and we'd like to get a quick sample of the Basalt up there on the rim and Gene's stereo pan and then press on. And I emphasize that the walk back constraint that we're up against in 14 minutes - 13 now.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I'll get a sample of dust, I'll sample it by hand. But it'll be documented. Now I'll get it in a bag in a minute since I don't have any.
|CERNAN| that rammer again.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay, well I better come there first I guess .
|CERNAN| but, okay.
|CAPCOM|Why don't you leave the core there Gene and then you can take the stereo pan while Jack's getting that sample and then you can get together and ram the core hole .
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| also dark.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CAPCOM|Sounds a little thin.

|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| to ram them while you're here? What did you do with my extension h andie?
|SCHMITT|Oh, it's here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll get them.
|CERNAN| to the east and towards the south to get this pan.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| you know, on the rim. And I'm up. Oh, that ought to be a beautiful shot, if I could see what my settings are.
|SCHMITT|Okay, the lower core is chucky jam full. I don't think I've budged that thing.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, I copied, aside from 3 trunnion angles, I copied one single rock - one single bag of basalt samples, is that correct?
|SCHMITT|that's right. 512.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| around the (garbled) side of the rim of this crater, the mantle on the inside of the rim, turns from this grey material that we've been sampling the sampling in here to a very dark grey material. And there's a lot of orange stuff that goes down - radially down into the pitted crater.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. How's the panning?
|SCHMITT|Hey, Bob, those cores didn't feel like they - follower went down at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Shouldn't it have gone a little bit?
|CAPCOM|Not necessarily if it's pretty compact stuff. You were having a hard time getting it in.
|SCHMITT|Well, I thought there was a little space up there, but maybe I just didn't feel it.
|CAPCOM|Not very much, ah -
|SCHMITT|I don't think there's much danger of them coming apart.

|CAPCOM|We need you guys rolling in 7 minutes.
|CERNAN| Well, I got them all anyway, Bob, I'm at 162. I'm out^of frlm That stuff and you're looking at me with the camera. That stuff is up toward that boulder, around that - about as far away from that boulder on the other side as we are on this side. ^And we re going to hack at that boulder too. Jack, let's see if we can t get t a boulder, anyway.
|CAPCOM|Ah -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Guys, we'don't have that much time.
|CERNAN| pieces, not a1lot, but enough that I've seen five or six of them. Little pieces1of obsidian-like glass. I got one in my pocket. Unbaeeed. Undocumented._i.

|SCHMITT|I got it, I got it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CAPCOM|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Let's go.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| that I picked1up right near where we'dug the trench.
|CAPCOM|Copy 561.
|CERNAN| with the - I'm going to give you something with the TV I want to show you where that dark material starts.
|SCHMITT|Hold still,.
|CERNAN| as it goes down to the right you see a lot of boulders, a lot o rocks that are protruding out. Where that rock pattern thins out, just beyond that is an orange - a visible orange radial pattern, and then beyond that is a definite change in albedo where you get the grey material, and a definite change in the number of rocks on the slope.
|CAPCOM|Gene, roger.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that1ai
|CERNAN| Let me finish, Bob. That particular rim material there continues around to the due north and then there's a drastic change where you see the - the inner rim completely tainted with this boulder
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene, and you can talk about it when you get home.

|SCHMITT|Did you get the DGE read?
|CERNAN| thing that station but not everything I'd like to give them.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Man, I tell you that LCRU was terrible, wasn't it .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's what I've got to do. I've got to tack into that sun.
|PAO|Station 5 is at the crater Camelot.
|CERNAN| think at that station but that could - I think based on heavy (GARBLE) - If I hadn't seen that alteration and all I'd seen is the is the - fractured block on a rim I might have - which looked like this stuff in the bottom - I might have said it was just another impact. But having all the color changes and everything I think we might have to. consider that it could be a volcanic vent.
|CAPCOM|Roger, it surely was different anyway.
|CERNAN| time to prove it.
|CAPCOM|We noticed. I guess that's the breaks of the game sometime.
|CERNAN| about giving them to me again.

|CERNAN| we get over here?
|SCHMITT|Go left, probably. Along the rim.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|If Charlie is smiling because my hands are tired why did he1let you have me get the charge off? Fine backup crew we've got.

|CERNAN| And the LMP frame count is somewhere around 7 - well 8.5, maybe.
|SCHMITT|that's Victory, look at it go to the left and look at it go to the right. That's Victory we're right on the ridge.
|CAPCOM|Yep. Okay and we're picking GARBLE you guys

|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|tell me where you want that thing and we'll get a pan around it.

|SCHMITT|Yep, it's - looks like a place you could spin a profile on.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And deploy the charge. Tell me where you're going.
|CERNAN|

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay. I guess we're ready to leave here. Huh .
|CERNAN| here, I guess we leave.
|CAPCOM|Roger we're ready for you guys to leave there -
|SCHMITT|there's notling else here now.
|CAPCOM|And we're pressing on towards Station 5.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| look down east - north into Victory?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I can do that, we - I - we've got to go by there any way.
|CERNAN| I can look in there.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, it's a series of three craters. There's some boulders on the Taylor slope of the eastern most -eastern most - of the west - eastern slope of the southern most crater, the one we're closest to.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well it looks like - and see there's the other - I don't know what it looks like. The northwest end of the V has a white blotch - white blotch on it boulders on the other inner wall and right at the rim. And the northeast end of the V looks like it has somewhat darker rocks -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Part of that is shadowed, but I think they are darker. And they look like about the same as down here near the tip of the V on this -
|CERNAN| one sloping a way, one sloping towards us.
|SCHMITT|Yeah I know. I qualified it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:00 GET 146:06 MC-583/3
146:06:00|CERNAN| at 106 and - well yeah we're still 3.1.
|CAPCOM|Yeah. Copy that. Thank you.
|CERNAN| blocky. There a little - there's some increase in fragment size but that seems to be the result of some craters in the rim that have gotten below the debris that's covering it. I'd say that Victory's somewhat like Horatio in that it has has blocky inner walls but, has essentially a normal block population on the rim.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we've got a Rover sample going toward Station 5 at about 103 and 2.5.
|SCHMITT|Okay. 103 and 2.5
|CAPCOM|Roger. And that'll be just a grid s ample.
|SPEAKER|They're - none of them are just grid samples, Bob. (laughter)1.
|SCHMITT|You see you can't tell how deep they are until you get up to them.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that one there I could have gone through.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Station 5 is Camelot. Good old Camelot. (Humming)
|CERNAN| one of those -
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN| righ t. Look it .
|SCHMITT|Some of them have - well that one doesn't have any fragments in the bottom of it -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Looks like someone walked across it.
|CERNAN| in the thickness of the dark mantle in here. Did you - I didn't notice (garble) the stropping in that one terminal light mantle1
|SCHMITT|No, I didn't either. Obviously we'did
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Right at Victory, but It didn't show up.
|CERNAN| any difference anyway.
|SCHMITT|However, I tell you, I certainly get the impres sion there is a mantle. I would say that -
|CERNAN| but the dark mantle exists. There just - the craters -these craters are just too big not to have thrown up blocks. And their either subdued by the mantle or they haven't penetrated it.
|SCHMITT|And in these blocks you probably have both. Excuse me Gene (garble) .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 11:712/72 CST 23:00 GET 146:06 MC-583/4
146:06:00|SCHMITT|I'd say they've been subdued by the mantel. That - that really Imposes an impression on me.
|CERNAN| Horatio,for example on the big ones. But others I think are too young. And they just don't penetrate. Particularly those that are big and have bright halos.
|SCHMITT|But the only ones that look fresh and not enough to penetrate are these little ones with the glass in them.
|CERNAN| We'll look for one.
|SCHMITT|Now there's one with glass in it probably.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And without any blocks on it. That - that may not have penetrated.
|CERNAN| the shock indurated rock. Injured rock.
|SCHMITT|We're coming up to 103 and 2.6 now, so we need a sample up here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. 103 2.5 anywhere.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's affirm.
|CERNAN| go to the right here.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Right out in that little inner crater area right out in there is good. If you let me guide you a little I might get a rock sample. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's quite enough.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Move ahead - Move ahead about no right, no that's good. Straight ahead, straight ahead. Good, good, good, good, whoa. Now we'll give it a try.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|CAPCOM|We're allowed to go to 120 tonight.
|SCHMITT|I don't expect we'll make It. I think we'll get done before that.
|CERNAN| those batteries deserve any temperature they want today. After - going up that-
|SCHMITT|that's the soil.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:10 GET 146:17 584/1
146:17:00|CERNAN| temperature they want today after going up that -
|SCHMITT|that's the soil.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, the soil is at 44 Yankee.
|CAPCOM|Copy, 44 Yankee.
|SCHMITT|that rocks too big, I can't get it - too big.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No. Okay, got mine.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And the 125, the LMP frame.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. And just press on the same heading you've been carrying there, Gene, and that will get you to Camelot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Do you want to go where station 5 is, Bob ?
|CAPCOM|That's my understanding, Jack so press on toward there unless I tell you otherwise.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, but you were talking about changing station 5. I think station 5 is a pretty good spot.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and I think that's where we want to go - I just want to verify that - you can go in that direction though. I'll get with you if it's not.
|SCHMITT|Okay. It's probably the most concentrated boulder field on Camelot.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you know where it is, and we think it's on 092 and 1.6.
|SCHMITT|092 and 1.6 -
|CAPCOM|Roger. But you know where it is so you'll find it when you get there.
|SCHMITT|(garble) It's different.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| minute if it's - it's probably right over that rim on the right, Jack, right off your right hand.
|SCHMITT|Right you are.
|CERNAN| boulders on it.
|SCHMITT|It should be over there.
|CERNAN| You know I see why A1 and Ed had trouble walking up Cone Crater, you could stand right on the edge of the rim of a crater and not know it was there.
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| Moon - it's really orange. Can you see that color on the televis ion ?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:10 GET 146:17 584/2
146:17:00|SCHMITT|No answer.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|No, we couldn't see It, Gene, (garble)
|CERNAN| that second pan to see that stuff go radially down into the center of the crater at that contact.
|SCHMITT|Yes, that's good.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Doesn't make any difference, it's there, comes out or not.
|SCHMITT|Okay, look at that up the cleft up there, you can see definite change in albedo now between the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills, look it, right up this valley. You can't see it - let me -
|SCHMITT|You're right.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| e ffects.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| be darker in the cleft, you know.
|SCHMITT|(garble) LMP back to minimum.
|CAPCOM|Roger, thank you.
|CERNAN| a movie picture of us driving.
|SCHMITT|You're doing the driving, (garble) Classic of the century. You're doing -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, the fragment population - we're at 0992.0 is still about the 1 percent category, and it's hard to tell, going into the Sun, what kind of blocks you're dealing with, but my guess is that most - well, it's more than a guess, most of them look like they're slightly vesicular, and in that regard, resemble the gabbros.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|(garble) there are -there is something - there's a class of boulder that is black topped and very well rounded that is just about completely buried. Only not more than 5 centimeters of it projects above the surface. We've seen those off and on both days, remember Geno?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And they seem to be quite distinct. At least you notice them, now, whether it's just a continuation of the mantling, I don't know, but most other boulders - the big ones seem to be - project above the surface more than just that 5 or 10 centimeters.
|CERNAN| have that wrinkled old face feeling.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:10 GET 146:17 584/3
146:17:00|SCHMITT|Yes. There are blocks over there though, aren't there?
|CERNAN| concentrated outcrop or concentrated masses of blocks up there on the slopes anywhere, like (garble) massif.
|SCHMITT|Possibly due -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think that might be Camelot. .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Nice shot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Now, wait a minute -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, yes.
|CERNAN| wait a minute, doggone it,
|SCHMITT|It's not Horatio is it?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|I think that's Camelot, Horatio didn't have blocks that far up the rim.
|CERNAN| tell you, I remember.
|SCHMITT|Yes. Back down - down at 5 (garble) these blocks -
|CERNAN| we're coming right up to station 5, right at it.
|CAPCOM|Right at it.
|SCHMITT|Only way to fly.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you want to park up on the rim so they can have a good panorama?
|CERNAN| other side of those blocks if I can.
|SCHMITT|Yes, you better, then they can look with the sun on them.
|CERNAN| that other rim over there.
|PAO|We've said goodnight to Ron Evans.
|CERNAN| they can look at these blocks across the way. I got to go around this block field, though.
|SCHMITT|I should hope so. (garble)
|CERNAN| Horatio now, okay.
|SCHMITT|Looks just like it did before.
|CERNAN| to.
|SCHMITT|All the blocks look very much the same in the wall of Horatio.

146:25:00|SCHMITT|the vugs and partially re crystallized vesicles. The textile variations are plainer and they're primarily sub layer in the concentrations of vesicles.

|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Magazine Delta.
|SCHMITT|Watch yourself through here, Gene-o.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy, this is certainly a year of the sub floor. As we mapped it, it's certainly a uniform - uniform rock type, I'll tell you. The only variations are those gray dunes which are - which just seem to be either finer or the absence of vesicles. Boy, I'm nose to nose with a piece of it right now. Say Bob, where can I get a new set of bags?
|CAPCOM|Okay, you want - the new bags they'll be under Jack's seat.
|SCHMITT|there's some under my seat. There's some, Geno.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Here I am, folks in the middle of a boulder field, just minding my own business.
|SCHMITT|I don't know if I mentioned it. The texture - mineral texture is - appears to be sub-othetic to - sort of like - like a good diobase although a little coarser. But it's unquestionably organized and with that variation in vesicle concentration.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that, Gene.
|CERNAN| only got one left and you don't have any, I don't believe.
|SCHMITT|I don't have any.
|SCHMITT|Bob, there - I have the impression that these blocks are buried up here, that the mantle does exist, even on Camelot. There are a few blocks that are
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 23:19 CST 146:25 GET MC585/3
146:25:00|SCHMITT|lying out on the - looks like they're lying more less on the surface but you might - you can attribute those to - to craters that have disrupted the block field.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good observation.
|SCHMITT|the big ones seem to be projecting out of the - the big ones seem to be projecting out of the mantle.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Do you see any such mantle on -
|SCHMITT|Although, I can't see how the mantle in here could -
|CAPCOM|On top of them.
|SCHMITT|It's not as - No, I don't. What's there seems to be what could have been knocked up there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I understand.
|SCHMITT|I see a place where - I see a place where I think we can skim some off the top of a rock, which I think we ought to do.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|But I don't have the impression of draping so much as I have just of burial and I have a feeling that the - this zap pitting process just to clean these boulders off of anything that might have been on top of them. In excess of what's around them right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're talking about -
|SCHMITT|Also, like Horatio the — go ahead.
|CAPCOM|You talking about mantle blocks then mantle and then clean off by zap pits, in other words.
|SCHMITT|that's right.
|SCHMITT|Most of the rocks seem - that seems to be what has happened all over the Moon that we've looked at. But the rocks are always cleaner than the - than the surface, of course. The far rim of Camelot - you can see - fact is everywhere but where we are and on the rim near the LM, the - there seems - the rim seems to be completely covered or at least the blocks don't show through. They show up in the wall but not in the rim. That's much like Horatio but not to the extreme that we thought Horatio. I'd say, at Camelot, the mantle is - oh maybe - at the most - the rim thickness at that mantle is on the order of a half of what we saw at Horatio.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|the pan should let you measure that - we'll we'didn't get a pan at Horatio but we got some rover
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 23:19 CST 146:25 GET MC585/4
146:25:00|SCHMITT|shots of it but you may be able to come quantify that a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I covered, Gene-o.
|CERNAN| I've got everything cleaned up and mark gravimeter.
|CAPCOM|Copy, mark that.
|SCHMITT|Here's a nicely structured rock that we probably ought to work on here. Structured again in the vesicle concentration and then I think we ought to try to get - right over there we can get mantle.
|CERNAN| about some of these rocks. There's a lot of - they may be zap pits - I guess you looked at them closer than I did but there sure is a lot of - lot of lineation in some of that white - white material, Jack.
|SCHMITT|What scale?
|CERNAN| s cale.
|SCHMITT|Well I mean the - Okay.
|CERNAN| see if it's up here.
|SCHMITT|the crystal grains are - seem to be linear but they are more or less random. Is that what you . mean?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| random. There's some rocks here that are - that are highly vesicular and there's others that are not.
|SCHMITT|that's right.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and a reminder 17. You guys have the primary priority of the blocks and then a rake soil of the - of the white sub-floor soil there and you've only got 15 minutes before we want you driving back to the LM. OVER.
|SCHMITT|Gene, if this is what you mean, it's -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Let's sample this.
|CERNAN|

|CAPCOM|Okay, now Jack and get the rake soil and maybe also get the soil off of the top of one of those boulders that you thought you saw1-
|SCHMITT|Yep. Whew. I've got to have Gene with me since my can't carry sample bag on.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|I probably can if I'm careful but I keep dropping them.
|CERNAN| density of the white minerals in them or crystals, than I've ever seen before, Jack. Where did we see these kind before?
|SCHMITT|Well, when I looked at them first, that's what I thought - but I think that the zap pits are making the white standout more. They are fooling you a little bit.
|CERNAN| hand lens it looked like a fairly normal gabbro - like some of those that have crystallized with the mare basalt. Where are you? You ready to take them back over here? What I want is a sample off one of these rocks. Okay, let's get that and now let's get the rake sample.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72, 23:30CST, 146:38GET, 5 86/3
146:38:00|SCHMITT|But it looks to me like the soil has been thrown up there rather than - this rock is about 3 meters in diameter and it - but it's one of the flat surface rocks. It only stands about — at the most — 1/3 of a meter high.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| rock interface and get soil off the rock I think.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Whoops, oh yeah I've got some soil - don't kick up anything new.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| it's about a centimeter deep and a half a meter in. Let's take that chip that's flying on top with the next scoop.
|SCHMITT|In a minute. Let's take the soil on that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I was looking - okay let's take that one th en.
|CERNAN| you pick that one up put that little chip -
|SCHMITT|Well - I don't want to get the chips - I want the soil. Either that or a coherent rock.
|CERNAN| it at that.
|CERNAN| bag it real quick.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| we're taking a piece of the rock itself which looks pretty much like the other one, Bob. It might be a little bit more vesicular. 
|CAPCOM|Okay, and that'll be in 466, right?
|CERNAN| able to grab it with my hand. Put this -
|SCHMITT|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 23:40 CST 146:46 GET MC-587/1
146:46:00|SCHMITT|Okay, the soil came from a half a meter in from the soil boundary. We need to get - let me get over here and try to get one bag of soil that's away from the boulder. I'm going to get my hands along here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, roger. And the present time we drop the rake soil; we'd just like to get the kilogram of soil somewhere between the boulders. I'm hoping that you can.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It will be. (garble) Okay, it is now.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. That'll replace the rake soil sample we were going to get. And we'd like you moving in 3 minutes.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, right there. Let me -
|CERNAN| pair with our soil sample too.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Okay, bag 46 7 is where your kilogram is coming from.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy.
|CERNAN| to you.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's 467.
|SCHMITT|Pinch it down tighter or it'll leak out.
|CERNAN| me try to get a -
|CERNAN| di dn ' t you?
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Let me get an after of it though.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| west of the gnomon that was set up for the top of boulder soil sample. So it's a match pair, really, in that regard.
|SCHMITT|Don't forget your gnomon.
|CERNAN| in a p an ?
|SCHMITT|(garble) I've already started it. Okay, I'll go over near the Rover and get one.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 23:40 CST 146:46 GET MC-587/2
146:46:00|SCHMITT|Okay, I got the gnomon.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|(garble) do you read me?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|(garble) 17, loud and clear. We'd like you to leave immediately, if not sooner.
|SCHMITT|Hipity hopity, hipity hopity, hipity hop over hill and dale. (Singing) Hipity hopiting along.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. Okay, and when you leave here, 17, remember that we want to pick up EP number 8.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're ready.
|SCHMITT|Go.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that. And when we leave we want to take EP number 8 with us, guys. We'd like the SEP turned back on and the blankets closed. Okay, Jack, I guess that's your option, you may -
|SCHMITT|Let me be sure.
|CAPCOM|- stop and take the charge off when you get to the distant. If it's only a short one, you might like carrying it in your lap.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I'll get it. I'll get it.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|CERNAN|
|PAO|Explosive package number 8 is a quarter pound charge.
|SCHMITT|Closed. Closed is - What happened to the Velcro on that other side?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It came off, Gene. It's stuck to the Velcro.
|CERNAN| we'll get EP 8, the camera's going.
|SCHMITT|We made a mistake earlier and it's too late to rectify it in carrying these charges.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Negative, Jack. If you don't have it off, we might want to carry this one.
|SCHMITT|that's right, that's right. I say the mis take was made earlier and is no problem now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 23:40 CST 146:46 GET MC-587/3
146:46:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's on, all squared away.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Just a little - there it is.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And how about a frame callup before you get back on there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|PDR's at 50.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|170.
|CAPCOM|Copy 170.
|SCHMITT|LMP's 170.
|CAPCOM|And Jack,it'd be my opinion, that you've just gone back over the same (garble) that you came up this morning. It's probably not necessary.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll use it until it runs out.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|But when you leave me at -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we'll let Gene take some of the photos near the bomb, on neither charge (garble).
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|there it is, I guess.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Up closer to you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, let's go.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, traverse to LM: 12 minutes, 0851.4. Th a t1 s -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Just about.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|No, we think so. We've been transacting back inside (garble).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 23:40 CST 146:46 GET MC-587/4
146:46:00|SCHMITT|It must be pretty close.
|CERNAN| that's what my checklist said.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, 1 guess my impression, and it's purely - pure interpretation right at this stage -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:49 GET 146:56 MC-588/1
146:56:00|CERNAN| pure interpretation right at this stage that Camelot is mantled by whatever has formed the dark mantle.
|CAPCOM|Copy that-
|CERNAN| degree that Horatio is.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CAPCOM|Then give us a mark when you're going - then give us a mark when you're going
|SCHMITT|I'm sorry Bob -
|CAPCOM|And we'don't have -
|SCHMITT|Wait about - a minute
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. And we'don't have bat tery temperatures here if you could quickly give them to us. And we'don't have battery temperatures here if you could quickly give them to us.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I never did give you that. It's 110 and 136.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, good enough. Thank you.
|SCHMITT|Never did get that for you. But I tell you the inner wall of Camelot is - The inner wall of Camelot to the east is certainly blocky.
|CAPCOM|Well there were a few blocks where you guys were too.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CAPCOM|Well there were a few blocks where you guys were too.
|CERNAN| too. It's- Hey, here's some Rover tracks - Hey somebody's been here before.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and 17, what we're looking for is deploying charge number 082 and charge 0.4 on the range.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay, we're at 083 and 1.1. We're just about abeam the eastern rim of Camelot. And there's Ch allen ge r.
|CERNAN| ALSEP. I think I'll go this way. (Laughter.)
|SCHMITT|Gee, it seems like a short day. (Laughter)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Say, you've heard about this country. Say, looking over there though, there's no - We're about oh, 50 meters from boulders at Camelot. And there appears from this distance is the same that we sampled from 5. I think we have pretty well identified the subfloor, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds like we have and sounds like from the very deepest - even from the bottom of Camelot it looks like it's about the same.
|SCHMITT|It sure does. I can't say I understand it. But that's the way it appears right now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:49 GET 146:56 MC-588/2
146:56:00|CAPCOM|You can't say what, Jack? Okay, understand that.
|SCHMITT|I can't say that I understand -
|CAPCOM|Copy
|SCHMITT|Whatever filled this valley - It certainly was different than the Massif. I think we've proved that. And it presumably - at least everything I see indicates that it was an igneous extrusion of some kind. Either that, or we're - the whole valley's been tilted and we're looking at a some strange cross-section plainer more or less relative to the other mountains of a crystalline body that was formed in depth. But, I don't think that's likely.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's outstanding.
|SCHMITT|Is that what we planned to cover?
|CERNAN| Bob ?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. But, we've been everywhere we've planned to go, so, we must have gone just about as far as we've planned to go.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, but the straight lines. I don't know what the wander factor was, but I'm sure it was pretty h i gh.
|CAPCOM|17.6 they're telling me, so we went a little bit out of our way.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|0.7 and what was the bearing on, 083?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|0.4, guys.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's the range.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|But you want to bear north, don't you, little.
|CERNAN| you Bob?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. That'll be close enough. It's probably right on your track there.
|SCHMITT|Well, I don't make a habit of following myself. I like to cover new ground.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, but watch out for that new ground there looks like - Look at the Italian flag.
|CERNAN| before I saw the flag. No, I didn't I saw the flag first I've got to admit it
|SCHMITT|Come on now.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:49 GET 146:56 MC-588/3
146:56:00|SPEAKER|The boss said you saw the flag first.
|CERNAN| right in towards the LM. Man I want to stay away from ALSEP, I see the big boulders so I'll -
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You'll have to swing right after we deploy, probably.
|CERNAN|
|SPEAKER|Whooh.
|SCHMITT|Didn't we get any glass out of the bottom of those craters?
|CERNAN| that before we leave. There haven't been -
|CAPCOM|Some time you'll have time to do that I guess, guys, I'm not sure when.
|SCHMITT|4.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, 08, well she just went to 1. Okay 0 8 1. 4.
|CERNAN| pression there. See right ahead of us to the right.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Got your pictures.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| sion and I'll put it there. Beautiful. Oh, oh, okay, charge number 8.
|CERNAN| you?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I did. I got several of them.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Nope.
|CERNAN| and safe. Now let me check that, it's dusty. Yeah, it's safe. 10 2 is pulled in safe. 10 3 is pulled and safe.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|I guess as long as it didn't go off.
|CERNAN| what they -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:57 GET 147:04 589/1
147:04:00|SCHMITT|Ob, don't bang it. I don't care, say what they say, that's a charge.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You're right.
|CERNAN| I believe, let me -
|SCHMITT|Go ahead and turn around -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|this way I get a running shot of - right in the middle of it - let me get you - get them both in it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, boy.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Where is it?
|CERNAN| the LM on your camera.
|SCHMITT|I'll take it right at the front looking right at the thing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|About a 5 6 -
|CERNAN| charge and the LM all in the same order here, and I am one more than I just gave you. I can't look at it now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, one more than what you gave me at station 5, understand.
|CERNAN| n ow .
|CAPCOM|Roger. And if you guys will start out, we'll drive you by the ALSEP, Gene - Jack, and if you'll get out at the ALSEP, we'll have you look at the surface gravimeter and Gene can press on home to the LM.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| way, and then I'll drive all the way back around at 1 geophones, okay, shall I -
|SCHMITT|But you're to the north, you could drive in toward the heat flow, towards that big rock, if you can see that.
|CERNAN| thing. Bob, you want me to get some ALSEP pictures?
|CAPCOM|Negative.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, you can stand by for a feed- water dump very shortly. Okay, feedwater, go to OX, please.
|SCHMITT|I just got it.
|CERNAN| hope that thing's working, Bob.
|CAPCOM|A lot of it's working, we've just got to try and see if we can't level this thing tonight. When
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:57 GET 147:04 589/2
147:04:00|CAPCOM|you get off there, Jack, I'll talk to you a bit about procedures for that. And in the meanwhile, it's my understanding that the second UHT is not in the immediate vicinity, where it's accessible, is that right?
|SCHMITT|No, it is, I can get it.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|SCHMITT|Okay, and watch my heatflow over there, don't trip over them.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to take a pair of tongs -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I want your camera.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, you won't need to - we aren't planning on1taking the ALSEP photos right now.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, we're not sure you went to OX on your water yet.
|SCHMITT|I thought I did.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's coming up, now, we see it coming Jack, don't worry.
|SCHMITT|Gene, can you - okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me take this other tong in case I drop something.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got a tone again, Bob. I got a tone again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, what's it say? Probably just to water - it's been building up -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Want me to take-
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm coming over there.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's right, also.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We got our tones yesterday.
|SCHMITT|Can you see anything?
|SCHMITT|No -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You don't have - a brust okay, to brush off -no flags.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey, wait a minute, you got no flags.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:57 GET 147:04 589/3
147:04:00|CAPCOM|You look good down here, Jack. Jack, you look good to us.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene, I think you need to go OX, if you didn't.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yes, it's probably slow coining up.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, you want me to get a UHT, huh?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, I know where it is.
|CAPCOM|If it's quite close, but if it's not, don't bother, I think we can probably drive it by hand.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|018 - 018.
|SCHMITT|You don't want me to kick the lean yet huh?
|CAPCOM|Negative.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I've got a UHT.
|CAPCOM|Okay, when you go back to the LSG, Jack, we first of all would like a reading of where the bubble is in the circle, whether it's in the center, and what we're going to have to have unfortunately, is to have the bubble centered in the inner circle because this is apparently, a requirement, even though we'didn't train to it, apparently it's something that came up, and it's going to have to be within the inner circle of the bubble. The first thing we need to do is when you go up there is to see whether the bubble is in the center of the circle.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, that bubble is centered.
|CAPCOM|Okay, okay, the next thing we want you to do is put the UHT in the socket there, and move the -
|SCHMITT|Hey Bob.
|CAPCOM|LSG from side to side, do not pick it up, okay go ahead, Jack.
|SCHMITT|I did not have to touch it, it is centered. Okay, but now they're worried that it's stuck like your gimbal thing ^w as last night and also, the thing is that maybe something's hung up inside and in moving it we can jostle it free. They do not want it picked up, but they'd like to have UHT put in there and sort of have the instrument rocked from side to side to again see the bubble move, and once that is done, to then press it down into the ground and
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 CST 23:57 GET 147:04 589/4
147:04:00|CAPCOM|Again realign it and put the bubble with in the inner circle. Over.
|CAPCOM|They would also like to see if the gimbal is free.
|SPEAKER|How much do you want me to - How much do you want me to rock it. How far should I let the bubble travel.
|CAPCOM|Basically we just want to see it move if you go up to the outer circle, that's plenty.
|CAPCOM|And again, you can (garble)
|SCHMITT|there's only one circle. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Oh, I mean the outer rim, the rim of it.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I did that, it's still centered and the gimbal is swinging,
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy the gimbal is swinging and we copy you moved the bubble out to the edge of the bubble level and come back in to circle.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, I'm reading 0 89. 20.1, 002 , 92, 88. Boots are 65 and 66 batteries are 114 and 138 (garble) motors are off scale low forward (garble) is off scale-low and (garble) is 210 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, what's the first battery temperature there, Gene?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. They apparently don't believe you when you said you aligned it last night and they're concerned the shade (garble) of plane degrees. Copy 114 on that battery temperature Gene.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, in that case I guess you're free to come home.
|SCHMITT|Well, what is basically the problem with it?
|CAPCOM|They haven't been able to level it for some reason and they were afraid that the thing wasn't level. They were hoping also maybe by moving it that you might jostle it a bit and it would come to level, but I think we'll just have to think about it some more. But, at first presumption, the easiest solution was to have it unleveled, which case we could fix it this way. But I guess tha -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72, 00:07CST, 147:13GET, 590/1
147:13:00|CERNAN| solution was to have it unlevel in which case we could fix it this way but I guess that's not the case. We'll have to see what happens overnight. Give us the chance to follow the tradition and come back to the ALSEP tomorrow.
|CERNAN| it's level a little bit - put it off level a little and see if you can work it.
|CAPCOM|I don't think so Jack, that doesn't sound very good to me. Why don't you just leave it there if it's centered with the level bubble within the inner - within the inner circle there. That's the requirements as far as you can tell and we'll just have to leave it over night again and why don't you come on back to the LM.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene are you at the Rover?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, you gave me my - your readings and when you get done let me know because the first thing we want to do is work on the SEP a little bit.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| SEP?
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, I when you go back to the SEP now - I'm going to do this first and get -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, I want you to go back to the SEP now and let's do this first and get it out of the way and it'll you can probably do this anyway while Jack's coming home. When you open the blankets remember that it's the back of the SEP there was a piece of velcro on the case and a piece of velcro just above - just inside the rear hinge on the covers and this is what you sort of peel back when you go to remove the back end there so you can get the DSEA out. Remember that piece of tape th ere .
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that came off. That came off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, this is on the side away from you when you stand facing it. Right?
|SCHMITT|Oh, no that's the side - go ahead, Gene I'm sorry. Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Gene, if you stand facing It in the back away from you is this - there's a strip of velcro on the case and there's another strip of velcro on the blanket itself and this is the velcro you have to tear off or unhook as it were, but when you come to tear the blankets down to get the DSEA off, remember that piece?
|CERNAN| I'm on the LMP side - that's on the other side.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72, 00:07CST, 147:13GET, 590/2
147:13:00|CAPCOM|Right, that's on the other side of the top and what we're interested in - number 1 is that piece of velcro still mated or when you open the blanket to cool it does that velcro come open, over.
|CERNAN| dust it comes open, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and so what happens —
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, well the feeling is -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, you can't depend -
|CAPCOM|Okay, well feeling is that -
|SCHMITT|Bob, the GARBLE, the cover is in it - will stay open about 150 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Stand by a minute. What you're saying is that the cover actually stands up a little bit in space.
|CERNAN| and normally it should swing 180 degrees parallel with the top of the steps.
|CAPCOM|Okay, but does that velcro in back stay mated?
|CERNAN| it - it holds. Yes, it's b eing mated but it probably holds the covers open 150 degrees.
|CAPCOM|No. That's okay. What we're - talk - what the concern originally was was that when this happened the front light was getting down in the back there and warming up the back of the SEP. That's apparently not the case. Over.
|CERNAN| came off is the velcro that helped the - keep the covers closed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we were concerned about both pieces of velcro since one had come off.
|CERNAN| holds. In the back part of the SEP where the DSEA is is in the shade.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. Okay, while we're talking about this I 11 get back with you. Turn the DSEA and the receiver both to OFF, please. And read me a temperature, please.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that. And I mark them both off, right?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|I was sure you would. What did you do.
|CERNAN| crater. I documented it by shooting the LM across the crater at Infinity and then shooting the crater with stereo. At 11 feet and in that cross1sun there it's 7 and then I sampled it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72, 00:07CST, 147:13GET, 590/3
147:13:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|I guess now gnomon is a LM.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| bagged it - I1don't know whether we can keep it or not.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll hope.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN| pan I guess .
|SCHMITT|Okay, what do I have to do here.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Get that bag off you to start with. Be careful of that sample there.
|CERNAN| existence on a rover right now, I tell you. Oh, you don't believe me - look at that.
|SCHMITT|What?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Excuse me. Move forward just a little.
|SCHMITT|Now get your bag. Here you go.
|CERNAN| No, you're not. I maybe going nuts talking to that moving machine over there.
|SCHMITT|Boy, we'don't need any hooks I'll tell you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Can you stoop just a little bit.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Get your hook back.
|CERNAN| forget that.
|SCHMITT|Velcro is closed. Okay.
|CERNAN| the soil we're walking on and they change colors on you. Greens, and purples, irridescent. Irridescent sparkling.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll come over and I'll unload your stuff.
|CERNAN| got sense - I think. Let's see here - you've got - you're taking care of the SEP.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's all right.
|CERNAN| are open on the SEP rather.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that.
|CERNAN| that glass sample would be better off in the SRC?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 , 00:07CST, 147:13GET, 590/4
147:13:00|CAPCOM|We're still talking about that.
|CERNAN| empty. Up and away it goes. And that's all closed. Check your bag. Okay, now Bob, you've got to tell us which one of these you want in the SCB and which one you want just taken in because we've got our numbers all confused.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead. What we would like to do here on the closeout - guys let me read this to you first of all. In the SRC we'd like the following stops along with - let's see -s t an d by.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 00:17 CST 147:23 GET MC591/1
147:23:00|SCHMITT|Following - stuck - along with - let's see seven. CERNON1Is this 9 or 6.
|CAPCOM|Okay, guys, we're going to follow a. Apollo 16 mode and put stuff in loose. Because I'd like to segregate stuff in the following way. I'd like to put the long can and 4 core tubes in the SRC. I guess it's going to take a long - going to take awhile just carrying things back and forth. But they'd probably like to get this in because it's a volatile stuff. They'd like to get the long can and three core tubes in the SRC number 1. And then we'd like to get all the SCB floor samples in the same SRC. Over.
|SCHMITT|Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| altogether.
|CAPCOM|Right. Put those in the SRC.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|All the samples from SCB 4.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|these are 4. You want to get the core tubes in first, don't you?
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| got two hands. I'll come back by the time you pick them out.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and then - 17, do you guys remember where the trench samples - the 3 trench soil samples -which bag those were put in - from station 4. Over.
|CERNAN| had bags so I imagine I put it in whatever bag jack had, I think.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CAPCOM|Okay, then that'll be SCB 4, so we'd like those In SCB 4. And those are the ones that will go in the rock box and that's in agreement with what we want to do.
|CERNAN| you've got them, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|the long can. Here's a - oh. Got it? (garble).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 00:17 CST 147:23 GET MC591/2
147:23:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|One more core.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep, got them all.
|CAPCOM|And then - roger that - and then SCB 4 - all the samples in SCB14 — We won't bother to try and sort them out and then beyond that we'll fill them up with samples from SCB 5. Over.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Here, hold this. I'll get it.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, you had it on. I don't know but - they should have1that log. I don't remember who had it on .
|CERNAN| You held the bag and I put them in you.
|CERNAN| Sho rty ?
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed. That's why we want SCB 4 put in the - or dumped into the thing. But if it's dirty bags we just want to dump the samples in.
|CAPCOM|Okay?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, it probably would protect the glass a bit better if you put it in the SRC gently with the other rocks there. But lift easy - don't fill the SRC too full. But again, we'll be putting SCB samples in there to more or less flush it out if there's not too many SCB 4 samples.
|SCHMITT|Leave a space for a sample, I guess, Gene.
|CERNAN| not much space. It's going fast.
|SCHMITT|You really - well, can you leave one.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, it's over here.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 00L7 CST 147:23 GET MC591/3
147:23:00|SCHMITT|No, I'll bring it to you. I just -
|SCHMITT|there's some way -
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|there just about full - you got some left in there?
|CERNAN| ones .
|SCHMITT|Don't fill it too full.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey, we got some big rock samples.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|6 - probably nothing. But tell us.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Should have that SCB 8 under your seat with samples in it,
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|At station 3, maybe.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, let's take up SCB 8 and let's take up SCB 6 with along — and why don't you dump out the rover samples into SCB6?
|SCHMITT|Well, one reason not to take 6 is I don't know if I can get1it off.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And let's save SCB 4 because I think You may need that tomorrow.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. How about SCB 5? Is that only partially emptied1or is it totally emptied.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll take that up with us.
|CERNAN| I've done. I've1got SCB 8 full.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger on that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 00:17 CST 147:23 GET MC591/4 
147:23:00|CAPCOM|Okay, 8.
|CERNAN| clear, and I got your 4 cores - 3 cores, plus a long can. I got Jack's glass. I got SCB 4 and a couple of samples out of SCB 5.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. Sounds great.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|CERNAN| yeah. SCB 5, Okay. Now Jack, we've got SCB 5 that's half full. What have you got over there.
|SCHMITT|Bring it over here and I'll put it into 6.
|SCHMITT|6 is half - a little more than half full.
|CERNAN| That ought to make one full bag. Hey, these big rocks -they don't come out easy. Where's that big, big rock we got? That's in one of those bags too. Picked up a big one — here let me see if I can't dump it.
|SCHMITT|How's that for a lunar dump.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Perfect.
|CERNAN| this one over here? - No.
|SCHMITT|Hey, don't lock those -
|CERNAN| and make them and make them work easier.
|SCHMITT|Boy, I'll tell you - I really had to pull. I pulled harder than I like to in a pressure suit.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. SCB 8 and 6 are going up.
|CAPCOM|Okay and I understand 5 will be on the gate.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| You got any way of freeing up these gate hinges that lock the bags on? I'm dusting them but they're not going to lock - any of them. They're frozen., tight. Just about -
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. We'll think about it.
|CERNAN| them locked you may never get them off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll get to work on them over night.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 00:17 CST 147:23 GET MC591/5
147:23:00|CERNAN| I still can't1free them up.
|SCHMITT|Man those are heavy bags.
|CAPCOM|Jack, have you got the proper bag closed?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, what do you need?
|CAPCOM|Okay, John, thought maybe they were still open. He was1worried.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 00:27 GET 147:33 592/1
147:33:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, no John thought maybe you were still open, you weren't.
|CERNAN| before I go up.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we get no SSR's on the UTB We understand, roger.
|SCHMITT|No, I just checked and there's - it's all - they're all in the bags. And the Rover sample bag is empty.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Nothing left.
|CERNAN| going to latch on the back, I dusted them, but they're not going to work, I can't free them up -
|CAPCOM|We'll talk about it tonight, don't worry about it now.
|CERNAN| 1got a little more room then we had. Okay, let me get some thing else done. I wonder if I ought to take a sample bag holder up there to see if I can fix that, to see if it fixes.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, I suggest that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, receivers been dusted and blankets are open, power is off and off. Okay, I'm going to take the TGE off now - dust it and then take it off, and then just leave it there. Hey, congratulate Jose' on that fender cause I think he just saved us an awful lot of problems. He and whoever else worked on it.
|CAPCOM|He mumbled something very humbly about a thousand guys.
|SCHMITT|Well, tell him that's going to be my bring home present to him - a picture of his fender.
|CERNAN| an inventory on - under the LMP's seat.
|SCHMITT|Okay, where am I? I'm bringing the GG over here, but I'm not pushing it yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.

|CAPCOM|How about on the Moon?
|SCHMITT|(singing) Nothings in the big bag is it? I just can't compete with you astronomers.
|CAPCOM|Just keep trying.
|SCHMITT|Nothing's in the bag, is it? Big bag. Nothing's in the bag bag.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And there's one rock that disappeared yesterday, I don't know what happened to it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes, I saw it on the checklist, and I mentioned it to Bob, and he didn't come back with anything.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 00:27 GET 147:33 592/2
147:33:00|CERNAN|

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|One? No, there's 3 or 4 -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Who knows, we may need them at the rate we ' re going.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, while you're unloading there, on the 500 millimeter, you might squeeze off a few shots of the North and South Massif, to see if there are any lineations visible.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll give it a try. Why, are we ahead of time?
|CAPCOM|No, we're working right on time.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| packing the ETB, Jack, I'll do it. Am I behind you now.
|SCHMITT|Yes, I'm going to start inventoring the Rover and pulling the breakers so -

|SCHMITT|Okay. Confirm that your lens cover's off. The scissors are in.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|And the brushes, I hope this is the right setting. Hey, try F56 directly down-sun or up-sun at that Sculptured Hills there in the distance - see where I mean? I'll get it.
|CERNAN| Let's see, 500 mag ON, need mag ON.
|CAPCOM|Yes, I think we've got enough of those now, Gene. You got the map?

|CAPCOM|Don't hurry and smear them.
|SCHMITT|they're not smeared, but I just didn't overlap some of them.
|CERNAN| hurry and smear them.
|CERNAN|

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|there. Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I'm cycling it twice.
|CAPCOM|Do you have the maps there, Jack?
|SCHMITT|Okay, I guess I'll go in and pull some Rover breakers.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and - Roger, copy that. SCMITT1Oh, boy. Pulling breakers is not going to be much fun.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No. Oh, boy, oh boy, mag Romeo.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. You got the maps Jack?
|SCHMITT|No. (laughter) you ask me that one more time partner, and I'm going to get mad at you. Oh, I got -What have you got - you got the scissors?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got 3 or 4 breakers, let me try this one more time. Okay, I got it - with the old fingers.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that all 4 are out, Gene.

|SCHMITT|Hey, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17. Do you read?
|SCHMITT|Still there? We're supposed to be going through the LM see.
|CAPCOM|17, do you read Houston?
|CERNAN| got the switches wrong or something up there. Don't think so, though.
|SCHMITT|No.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me give them a call.
|CAPCOM|17, do you read Houston? Over.
|SCHMITT|Bob, you want to try again, we're on the LCRU. Yeah we read you, but I'm on the LCRU again we're not reading you through the LM.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I don't understand that, stand by. Press on with the rest of the close out.
|SCHMITT|I'11 leave you on the LCRU here. And we're pressing on.

|SCHMITT|Uh huh.
|CERNAN| knocked as hard as I could on my feet several times.
|SCHMITT|What you're going to say is you want me to brush you, huh,

|CERNAN| is gonna distirb it like this.
|SCHMITT|Shouldn't.

|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And don't forget the antenna, guys.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I need the GARBLE.
|CERNAN| of that?
|CAPCOM|Don suggested it.
|CERNAN| are sure because I wouldn't have seen it as I went up. As I took inventory with my book as I'll do here in a minute. Open battery covers taking care of dusting the crew. Mike is open 100 percent. They've been open 100 percent all day.

|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger that.
|CAPCOM|And we're ready to call you all in as you go to that.
|CERNAN| going on up the ladder.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Just about there.
|CERNAN| speed to crew of Apollo 17. I'm going to keep reading that. I like that message. How's Captain America, speaking of Apollo 17.
|CAPCOM|Captain America is sound asleep - just about to come around to AOS. We think he's sound asleep.
|CERNAN| pened yesterday.
|CAPCOM|He got up before noon this morning too.
|CERNAN| here we go - this pen didn't work.
|SCHMITT|Nothing will work when your hands get tired that's the problem. Wasn't a bad day. How long we been out, Bob, of course we're still out.
|CAPCOM|7 plus 27 so far.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|How does that grab you.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72, 00:46CST, 147:53GET, 594/4
147:53:00|CAPCOM|Well we're getting anxious to get you in and get your hatch closed.
|CERNAN| the pallet and as usual when it comes out I'll shove this stuff in and we'll be gone.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 00 :56 CST 148:03 GET MC-595/1
148:03:00|SCHMITT|Just takes a certain amount of time.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, are the three SCB's inside the hatch already?
|CERNAN| side, let's see I've got -
|SCHMITT|No -
|CERNAN| emptied the contents of 4 into the -
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN| one of these other two bags, so we've only got 2 of them here, plus the SRC.
|CAPCOM|Roger that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger that.
|CERNAN| of the rover, and I don't know what's under Jack's seat right now .
|SCHMITT|7 is under my seat.
|CAPCOM|We copy that, don't worry about it. SC"MITT1One more battery, Geno, and it's yours.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You always used to stand and watch me do this , anyway .
|CERNAN| but -
|SCHMITT|there you go.
|CERNAN| there a little further. Careful of that hat. Getting to look like a regular garbage dump down there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, ready?
|SCHMITT|Sorry, babe.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| not careful. Let me see if I've got one more step to go up. No I think that's the last one.
|SCHMITT|I'll just hold it here until you get it. I could shove that in if I push it with the SRC.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, we got big silver box.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob you've got the 2 SR - 2 SCBs , I'll push it in, SRC and there goes the ETB.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. Now how about a CDR?
|CERNAN| that's the only thing left out here.
|SCHMITT|Are you on a checklist?
|CERNAN| yeah I am, it says ingress. Let me knock some more dust off.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me get behind the door.
|CERNAN| with me. Oh.
|SCHMITT|Push, there you go. Keep the button closed, you're good. Beautiful, just float in. Hanging up a

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's my arm I'm getting in the way, there. Let get out of the way-
|SCHMITT|Let me just check that seal before we close that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I think it's okay. Okay, the hatch is partially closed1-
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well we're supposed to close our water first.

|SCHMITT|Well here, why don't I get yours and you get mine .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|If you turn I'll get yours.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Wait a minute.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Don't move yet, don't turn around.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Water's off.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I've got to get into position to do the other good things. You go ahead.
|CERNAN| No, let me down1Now why can't -
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me turn back, get out of your way. Got it?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and remember I think that the overhead valve is OPEN.
|SCHMITT|that's right.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And you ought to verify both, I guess.

|CHALLENGER|Okay, Jack. ECS suit fan 2 closed. Suit fan Delta P closed.
|CHALLENGER|Closed.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, master alarm just came on. Okay, and the heaters MESA open. You can open your MESA heaters. We have a Master alarm, Houston. I don't know why.

|CAPCOM|Roger. We think that what happened
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Well, I never thought I'd wear my EV cover gloves through 2 EVAs.
|CHALLENGER|I forgot all about them
|CHALLENGER|No, I didn't. I thought about taking them off until I started chipping those boulders. And I'm glad I wore them.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
|CHALLENGER|As hard as it is on your hands my - these cover gloves are just ripped to a nub. Glad it's not my gloves.
|CHALLENGER|Might consider taking them off tomor row .
|CAPCOM|Roger. 17, talking about your cover gloves.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, we're still wearing them Bob, and I swore I'd take them off after the drill, but, I used a bit of real-time common sense.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, closure off.
|CHALLENGER|LMPs gloves are off.
|CHALLENGER|Need some help.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.
|CHALLENGER|I can just about -
|CHALLENGER|No you went the other way.
|CHALLENGER|Did I go the wrong way?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I did.
|CHALLENGER|We'll try that one.

|CHALLENGER|I'll get this one.
|CHALLENGER|I'll (garble) (garble) (laughter).
|CHALLENGER|Okay, let me try that one now.
|CHALLENGER|It wants to go.
|CHALLENGER|Let me try then.
|CHALLENGER|(garble) got it.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.
|CHALLENGER|It's usually easier when you do it yourself the angles1wrong.
|CHALLENGER|Oh Boy. It's trying to get a little stiff. Oh they came off now they came off, ooh ho, ho, ho, okay doff helmets with visors. Now I'll get yours for you. They're in ray way.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.
|CHALLENGER|I know how you feel.
|CHALLENGER|I don't know why they're so wet. I don't know whether it's - they're just soaking wet.
|CHALLENGER|Everything is just twice as hard.
|CHALLENGER|Now comes the old hayfever again. That went up and that went down. There went BRA, let's get mine also.
|CHALLENGER|It feels good, now that these things are off.
|CHALLENGER|Oh man, does that smell. Sure can pick that up.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you got yours?
|CHALLENGER|I've got mine.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Bob. Now, helmets and gloves are off.
|CHALLENGER|Pressure looks good still.
|CHALLENGER|Hello, Houston. Do you read?
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17. Read you loud and clear, Ch alien ger.
|CHALLENGER|Very good Robert. The helmets and gloves are off.
|CAPCOM|Absolutely outstanding, (garble)
|CHALLENGER|Why don't you go home and get some sleep, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Absolutely outstanding. I can't say anything more than that. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. From the bottom of my soul or something

|CAPCOM|And the back up crew says you are even better than outstanding.
|CHALLENGER|(Laughter) Well, thank you, we enjoyed it .
|CAPCOM|Hey, I'll turn you over to Little Joe here, while I go1talk to some people. We've got 9-1/2 hour EVA scheduled for you tomorrow. We're planning to spend 2-1/2 hours extra over there at station 4.
|CHALLENGER|(Laughter). I hope those gloves that he's got packed in the back have got something in them. (Laughter). Ah,1let's read the checklist. See If we can go to bed on1time tonight.
|CHALLENGER|OH, man
|CAPCOM|That might be a change.
|CHALLENGER|I feel better than I did last night.
|CAPCOM|I'm going to turn you over to Joe.
|CHALLENGER|That didn't do very much good.
|CAPCOM|See you guys tomorrow.
|CHALLENGER|(garble) Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Verify safety on dump valve.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Bob. Get some sleep. Huh.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I verified them both.
|CHALLENGER|Sorry, to be touchy, Ocasionally.
|CHALLENGER|Descent water valve, open. Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Water valve's open.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, then you can take your purge valve off.
|CHALLENGER|Probably got a little dust in that tonight. Little stiffer1(garble) again.
|CHALLENGER|(garble) purge valves (garble) disconnect OPS hoses.
|CHALLENGER|Ah, man, that is dusty.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, let's - let me disconnect yours, you disconnect mine. It's easier to do it - I think I can get -
|CHALLENGER|Would you get the OPS hoses.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah. Okay, whatever it says.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.
|CHALLENGER|Disconnect OPS hose.
|CHALLENGER|Is that what it says?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.

|CHALLENGER|I got a little water - water hose here.
|CHALLENGER|That (garble) is complex, there.
|CAPCOM|That's perfectly fine.
|CHALLENGER|That was easier this time.
|CHALLENGER|It had to be.
|CHALLENGER|Smells like someone's been firing a carbine in here.
|CHALLENGER|I'm just standing here pushing that -
|CHALLENGER|Hot breaker.
|CHALLENGER|When you get it.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, little Joe. Are you there?
|CAPCOM|17, this is Houston. And -
|CHALLENGER|Little Joe, are you there?
|CAPCOM|Roger. How do you read Houston? Over.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we're reading you loud and clear. We're - the left hand column and we're both going PLSS mode to 0 and we'll be off the air for a scoosh.

|CHALLENGER|(garble) that is.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, the whole thing.
|PAO|Astronaut Joe Allen has come on to relieve Astronaut, Bob Parker, at CAPCOM. We're in the midst of a shift handover here in Mission Control. Flight director, Gene Kranz and his team relieving the Pete Frank team. We anticipate the change of shift press briefing will begin at about one thirty A. M. in the MSC News Center briefing room. CHALLENGE'R1Okay, Joe, LMP' s PLSS is getting 02.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 31 minutes. The participants have left for the news center. And we anticipate the change of shift press briefing will begin in the next 5 or 10 minutes in Building 1. At the present time the CSM with Ron Evans aboard sleeping is passing over the landing site. That second EVA ended at 148 hours 12 minutes 10 seconds with a total duration of 7 hours 37 minutes 22 seconds. And at present time the LM crew is in the process of getting the - getting out of their suits. They'll begin doing that shortly and then getting the LM cabin reconfigured and ready for their sleep period. And in the control center, tonight, while the crew is asleep, we'll be making plans for the third 7 hour EVA scheduled for tomorrow.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 01:26 CST 148:33 GET MC-598/1
148:33:00|CHALLENGER|Hey - hey Joe, this is Gene.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Challenger's been holding at about 5.5 every since we got in here. You all happy with that?
|CAPCOM|Looks good to us, Geno. We've been watching it and everyone's happy down here.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, well this morning when we were getting ready we started at 5.5 and prior to that it s been at^5.0 all the time. Just so we're not venting anything that's all.
|CAPCOM|Geno, we here you on that and we'll be watching it t
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we're about 2 minutes into the CDR s 02 charge.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, LMP has 96 percent on his guage.
|CAPCOM|Thank you, Jack, we copy that.
|CAPCOM|Geno with regard to your observation made to us a few moments ago, I guess we will ask for the cabin return to the AUTO position and your suit diverter valve to CABIN please. We are about 2/10ths of a psi from cabin release, over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're getting that now.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, CDR's reading 94 percent on the 02 1charge.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 41 minutes. The Change of Shift Press Conference is ready to begin at this time, we'll take down the live air-to-ground release lines, record any conversation with the crew for play back following the press conference.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 02:03CST 149:11GET 599/1
149:11:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 149 hours 11 minutes. During the change of shift press briefing the major activity aboard Challenger on the lunar surface and here in mission control has been to get the spacecraft in the proper configuration for the crew to begin their eight hour sleep period. The crew reported and we confirmed through telemetry here on the ground that the spacecraft cabin pressure had come up just a little bit above what we would normally expect — normally runs around 5 pounds per square inch. And we're seeing a pressure of about 3/4 of a pound higher than that about 5.73 pounds per square inch. This is not particularly unusual. we'did see a pressure rise following rep ressurization after the first EVA where the cabin pressure came up somewhat above normal. The pressure relief valve in the cabin would operate at about 5.83 pounds per square inch. In the taped conversations with the crew that we obtained during the change of shift briefing, you'll hear some conversation about the cabin pressure and some instructions to the crew to have them looking for any sources in the cabin that might be putting extra oxygen into the cabin such as the PLSS fill valves that might not have been closed fully or something like that. At this point the cabin pressure has stabilized it looks like and we've found nothing amiss. We'll replay the tape conversation for you and then standby live.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, LMP1s OPS pressure is 6300.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Commander's OPS pressure is 6100.
|CAPCOM|Copy 6100.
|CHALLENGER|Say Joe our cabin pressure is riding even higher now about 57. '
|CAPCOM|We copy that.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, Joe we had the commander's hoses stowed at his suit flow - that might have done it. Is that right?
|CAPCOM|Sounds very possible, Jack. We'll look at it a little more here.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, this is Houston requesting you move your demand regs A and B to egress please.
|CHALLENGER|They're egressed.
|CAPCOM|Okay. 17, Houston. We noted down here that your suit diverters went to egress and we want the demand regs to the egress position, please.
|CHALLENGER|That's right but the suit gas converter extends when you go to -
|CAPCOM|You're right again.
|CHALLENGER|Houston do you figure where we're leading?
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'don't think so. It looks like you're pretty steady between 55 and 56 and we're watching it very closely however.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you know when we had that problem this morning I hope the backflow did not hurt something when I had the LMP hoses stowed in the iso valve in suit flow.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 02:03CST 149:11GET 599/2
149:11:00|CAPCOM|Jack, just for your information we saw about the same thing last night. The only difference was the pressure didn't climb quite so high so we think whatever it is it really doesn't involve problems - the small problem you had this morning,
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe we've got the commander's PLSS back in the recharge station. We got a new battery in it. Odd numbers -and a new canister in it and we're working on Jack's right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, sounds good.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead, Joe.
|CAPCOM|We're still watching your cabin pressure down here. Could you check for us, please, if the PLSS fill valve is securely closed.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, it was closed.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Joe you want me to check out the regulator?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CHALLENGER|And Houston, Challenger, you want me to check this? Okay, ED vats are 37.2.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CHALLENGER|PCM is going high. Let me know when you're ready for the battery management.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. Standby on the battery management for a few minutes please and in the meantime could you check the low pressure PLSS fill valve closed, please. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, I checked that. It's closed.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, does your telemetry and R gage come off the same telemetry on that - same transistor?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. It does. And Challenger, we've got a communications problem at one of the sites and we're going to ask you to go to panel twelve and turn the power amplifier to primary, please.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, it's primary.
|CAPCOM|And Challenger, we're ready for battery management at your convenience.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, stand by.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Joe.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, this is Geno, I just dug a rock out of my pocket - no one back there probably remembers but when we were at Shorty, fumbling around trying to get everything done I said there was a piece of very shiny flat glass like looking material that reminded me of obsidian well it's not - it looks like a very fine gray rock but it's a fractured piece and it looks like its - I picked up a fractures of about 3 or 4 vesicle faces on it - the vesicle faces are very shiny. That's what reflections caught my eye. I think the unique part about it is - Jack may want to say something else about it. The unique part about it is I picked it up at Shorty. I documented halfway between the rover and where we were sampling that orange stuff and it will be in bag 12 Echo,
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 02:03CST 149:11GET 599/3
149:11:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, copy 12 Echo and I was assured by the folks here when I came in -
|CHALLENGER|That'll go in it.
|CAPCOM|that you did indeed have a shiny sample of some kind in your pocket and would probably find it later on. So they called that one. Could you turn off the power amplifier for us, p lease.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'll put it in SCB A.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, it's off and we'll put that rock in that sample bag and put in SCBA. Joe, this rock looks very much like 12008 - 12008. It's a fine grained - coarsely - very coarsely vesicular gray rock, probably basaltic.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, real fine. We want low bit rate power amplifier OFF in low bit rate and we can maybe label that one 17008. How's that sound?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 02:13 GET 149:21 MC-600/1
149:21:00|CAPCOM|31 08, how does that sound?
|CHALLENGER|No, you've got to lable that, Gene, rock. 11was going to tell you those other things but I thought I'd let Jack.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|The vesicles, if I may project the size of them probably were up to 4 or 5 centimeters in diameter. They're irregular shape but they're clearly vesicles that look like they're lined with either glass or very fine grained crystal. They're very shiny.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|And for our next act -
|CAPCOM|Jack, we're going to ask for your next act, that you check for us both PLSS valves OFF and both OPS valves OFF.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, they're both verified off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We understand that all 4 valves are verified off.
|CHALLENGER|That's affirm, Joe.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you. I'm sure you realize that we're still showing that pressure increasing very, very slowly and are pretty well convinced that nothing's leaking in from the outside so we're looking around on the inside here .
|CHALLENGER|Joe, is our oxygen consumption abnormal at this point.
|CAPCOM|No, not at all, Geno. Everything looks pretty normal except this slow creep in the cabin pressure.
|CHALLENGER|I guess the possibility is a creeping REG or a transducer, is that right?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, either that or it may be we're just watching some of the affects of the thermal shock that your tanks took when - from the repress itself. We're not worried about it at all, but we're still watching it.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we might make a note that my 21add BP area samples went into bag 8 also.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. That's noted.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, I've got some numbers if you'd like them.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|SRC is 41.5, BAG 6 is 24, BAG 8 is 35.
|CAPCOM|Copy 41.5 and 24 In Bag 6, 35 for BAG 8.
|CHALLENGER|That's it. Joe how many samples did we get today?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CHALLENGER|Don't start a big investigation, I was just curious.
|CAPCOM|Let me ask around, Gene. Well see in a minute1.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 02:13 GET 149:21 MC-600/2
149:21:00|CAPCOM|17, we think you have 54 samples from this EVA plus some coarse.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you Joe, just curious.
|CAPCOM|That's not half bad.
|CAPCOM|And -
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe. We're on 5-5 and I'm going to start doffing.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, copy 5-5 and before you get started there, would you put both the DEMAND REGS to close please, as we continue to watch this pressure.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe. DEMAND REG A going closed. The DEMAND REG B going closed.
|CAPCOM|Thank you. And we verify them both closed.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, that completes our tape playback. We're standing by live now. And the LM Cabin pressure reading at this time 5.77 pounds per square inch. There's no particular concern over the higher than normal cabin pressure. However, it is something we'don't understand at the present time. Now, there are a number of limited sources of oxygen that can be getting into the cabin to raise the pressure. And, as Joe Allen mentioned to the crew, there's not much chance that anything is leaking in from the outside. We've been systematically checking 1 by 1 the potential sources of the oxygen flow into the cabin. And at some point, if all of the potential sources are eliminated, we begin to reach the conclusion that perhaps the sensor is at fault. However, at this point, it's not possible to say what the - what the cause of the slightly higher than normal LM cabin and pressure i s .
|CAPCOM|17, this is Houston. We'd like the suit diverter back to cabin, please.
|CHALLENGER|Cabin.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 02:23 CST 149:31 GET MC-601/1
149:31:00|CAPCOM|Cabin press is dropping down very slowly now so we think we've got a time leak in one of the cabin regulators, one of the demand regulators and we'll run a check after you get squared away there a little better.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, we'll be at your beck and call.
|CAPCOM|I'll always smile at that.
|PAO|The demand regulators which Joe Allen was describing to the crew and suggesting that they might be the source of the small oxygen leak into the cabin are used to control the flow of oxygen from the storage tanks in the lunar module to the cabin. The procedure that we're going to follow here is to let the cabin pressure continue to drop. 1It's come down from 5. - from a high of 5.81 pounds per square inch to 5.73 and we're going to let it get down a little closer to 5 pounds and then run some checks to determine which of the two regulators is leaking. The procedure after this was determined - after this is determined would be to simply use the good regulator and turn off the regulator which has the small leak.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we're going to air out the suits, we're going to go to suit flow on the commanders' ISO valve now.
|CAPCOM|All righty.
|CHALLENGER|Say again.
|CAPCOM|That sounds good.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The crew aboard Challenger, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt running about 2 hours behind in their presleep preparations at this time. And, we'do expect to give them a full 8 hour rest period, which would mean that we will have a slip In the start of EVA 3, probably somewhere an hour and 2 hours. We won't be able to pin that exact start time down until sometime after the crew has gotten to sleep, and we see how their sleep period is working out, but again 1 to 2 hours delay in the start of EVA 3 looks likely at this time.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 02:49 GET 149:56 MC-602/1
149:56:00|SCHMITT|Joe, I guess you guys are tired of looking at my heart beat so I goning to tury the biomed off as I get out of my suit.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|CERNAN| me ?
|CAPCOM|Geno, you're five by.
|CERNAN| his suit. I'll be monitor.
|CAPCOM|Roger. From the way the 2 of you worked today I'd think you could just about turn him upside down and pour him out.
|CERNAN| hole at the end of his wrist.
|SCHMITT|Joe, the day they can pour me out of any thing they'll call me slim. Talk to you later.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Among other things.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|The clean room will never be the same again.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Challenger, this is Houston.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Geno, we're going to start to investigate which of your demand regulators is leaking and we're going to ask you to put DEMAND REG ALPHA to cabin now and as we watch it please do not make any urine dumps. Over.
|CERNAN| and we'll go to cabin now. Okay, ALPHA'S in cabin and we'll be ready for your debriefing here in about 5 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, and it's going to be a short one.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 20 minutes. We're looking at a LM cabin pressure now of between 5 point 61 and 5 point 65 and you heard CAPCOM, Joe Allen,1. instruct the crew to turn back on one of the cabin oxygen regulators which supplies 02 to the cabin from the storage tanks. REG A is the one that's on line right now. we'll watch the cabin pressure and see if it begins to rise again, and if so we would conclude that Regulator A has a small leak. However, if nothing happens we'll then turn Regulator A off and turn REG, Regulator B, on and watch it to see if the cabin pressure begin to go up with that regulator. The LM Environmental Systems Officer made one point to Flight Director, Gene Kranz, and that is that very very small amounts of additional gas in the cabin will show up in our tele me try readings. N ow, we're talking ab out tenths to hundreths of a pound per square inch of pressure and there are a number of possible things at the end of an EVA that could contribute to this kind of a pressure rise, such things as moisture in the suits when the suits are
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 02:49 GET 149:56 MC-602/2
149:56:00|PAO|removed, evaporating carbon dixoide or the temperature rise, small temperature rises, in the cabin due to the heat stored in the rocks brought in. All of these things could have contributed to causing the pressure rise that we saw and it may well turn out that neither of the regulators has any problem. In the event that there is a small leak in one of the two regulators the Lunar Module functions perfectly well, the cabin atmosphere would be maintained perfectly well with one regulator and the procedure would be to simply shut down the regulator that was leaking. It, of course, could be brought back on line if needed and would perform it's function. And it still appears that we are approximately 2 hours behind in getting the crew ready for their sleep period. We have a clock in the control center counting down to our best estimate at this time as to when the sleep period will begin and it now shows 2 hours 36 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 150:25 CST 3:18 MC 603/1
150:25:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston, we're going down voice backup.
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we are ready for your EVA-2 debriefing.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17. To begin with, we want you to delete that step going to down voice backup, and I've got a surface block data to read up to you. A few minor changes in your lunar surface checklist. And a couple of very quick questions for the debriefing when you're ready. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead in the stated order.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Moving right along now to the surface block data lift off time, T- 33, 152 plus 30 plus 01; T-34, 154 plus 28 plus 33; T-35 , 156 plus 27 plus 05; T- 36, 15 8 plus 25 plus 37; T-37, 160 plus 24 plus 09, Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe. Starting with 33. 152 3001 154 2833 156 2705 158 2537 160 2409, and what's our present REV?
|CAPCOM|REV 32, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Joe, for sanity purposes what day is this?
|CAPCOM|We've checked around the room here and the concensus is it's Wednesday morning. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, okay. I really wanted to know whether it was (garble) ham or frankfurter morning and I guess we can work that out.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. Aparently the surgeon is happy with either of those days and we want you to turn to - right now to 5-7 in the checklist and perform that - one particular step at 150 hours which will prevent the computer clock from overflowing and that's proceed VERB 37 enter 06 enter proceed SEP. We'll stand by for that. Give us a mark as you start it. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're starting PRO. Proceed. VERB 37 enter. VERB 30 - Okay, Joe, you don't want me to go on the VERB -you' re not going to give us an update, huh?
|CAPCOM|No update required. That was just to prevent an overflow. And then I'm ready for the quick changes in the lunar surface checklist when you are.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Begin by putting the demand REG Bravo to cabin position and leave the demand REG Alfa in the cabin position where it now is. And I'll continue on with the changes in the checklist here, page 5-6, left hand side, where it reads configure ETB, the - the 4th line down that's starts out 4 B and W mag, they should read, Hotel India, Juliet and Romeo in LCG compartment. Then going up to the right hand side under stow in ETB, change the line 1 B&W mag Romeo to read 1 B&W mag Kelo Ove r.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, I changed the mags in the empty from 0 to Romeo and the mag in stow from Romeo to Kelo.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 150:25 CST 3:18 MC 603/2
150:25:00|CAPCOM|Okay, that sounds like the thing to do and a note on your demand regulators, we're showing that the demand regulator Alfa is - has good integrity and we're now in the process of checking the demand regulator Bravo. I've got a couple of fairly quick questions here when you're ready for those.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe go ahead with your questions and integrity is certainly what we need around here, right?
|CAPCOM|Okay. Jack, a question for you to begin with. Is your gold visor sticking half way down aparently that's based on a discussion earlier, Over.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah. Aparently his visor is sticking.
|CHALLENGER|Which one? The gold visor?
|CHALLENGER|No, he said his sunshade is sticking half way down but the gold visor's not.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that answers the question. We couldn't tell from the TV whether it was the visor or the sunshade. That's fine. We also heard some discussion about -possible wear in the seats of the suits when you were dusting each other off. We want to know if you could see the - any hint of the aluminum layers showing through in the suits. Over.
|CHALLENGER|No, Joe. Not to worry. Just a few scars on the PLSS thermal blanket in back where you probably rub the seat when you get in. Nothing on the suits.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geneo. Now 2 real quick geology ques tions, that will help us do the plans for your EVA tomorrow. The first one has to do with station 4 and you called out some material on the Rim there - the crater at station 4 which looked like bedded spatter, and we're wondering if that resembled things that you'd seen in Hawaii. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Joe, I think they misheard. I think I may have said shattered and you might of said - thought spattered. No, I didn't - neither one of us intended to leave that impression. The rock - the big rock we sampled was - looked like shattered intensely shattered gabbro such as we've had around the LM. The rocks probably more sugnificantly that Gene - one of which Gene picked up with the fine grain vesicular basalts - partially vesicular basalts. And we'didn't have enough time to really examine the interrelationships of those rock types there but those were the two fragment types we saw.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. That's quite clear to us now. Also a question about station 4 -
|CHALLENGER|Joe, -
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|The bottom of that crater now had material that was extremely disorganized and it's aspect -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 150:38 CST 0331 MC 604/1
150:38:00|SCHMITT|the bottom of that crater, now, had material that was extremely disorganized in its aspect and, really, we'didn't have time to examine it in detail in order to decide why it was disorganized. It did not necessarily look like the boulder that we sampled at the rim.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, understand that. A question about the boulder you sampled at the rim. Would you compare the basalt in this boulder to - which you may have called a gabbro - I'm not sure in any case the basalt - to samples which you collected at Camelot and at ALSEP. Over.
|SCHMITT|Well, my impression was that they were the same rock type.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's our impression, too. Thank you. That's it for us on the questions and for information, we're showing your cabin pressure is holding fairly steady even with both those demand RE Gs on.
|CERNAN| and let us know. I expect one of them is probably leaking p re t ty siow.
|CAPCOM|You have no worry about that Gene. We're looking at it real close.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|It is just as clean as a whistle.
|CERNAN| from the looks of us. That's good to hear, though, it's a good bird. So'is this one.
|SCHMITT|Joe, is there any - do you have any more debriefing questions?
|CAPCOM|Negative, Jack, and we're interested that you move right along so we can get you - get you turned in there and get some rest.
|SCHMITT|We're moving. We're eating now. We're feeling the same way, I think.
|CAPCOM|Troops, enjoy your meal there, and at your convenience you can go ahead with the feedwater recharge. We want you to hold off on the oxygen recharge until we watch these regs for about another 10 minutes. And give us a mark if you do start the water recharge, please. Over.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And, if there are any ways we can cut corners on the time here, it'll be helping us because we're still looking at it as being down a couple of hours nearly.
|CERNAN| can. Best place in the world to make it up is tomorrow night.
|CAPCOM|Right, Gene-o, and actually, we're going to pick up a good one shortly because we're coming up to a pad in the timeline. So, as long as we'don't waste too much time, we're doing pretty well.
|CERNAN| amount of housekeeping we have to do but, very seriously, day after tomorrow is a very short day and I think we ought to look at making up any time. I'm a hold-faster on sleep periods but tomorrow is the one which I think is selectable.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 150:38 CST 0331 MC 604/2
150:38:00|CAPCOM|Roger, we hear you.
|SCHMITT|Hey, Joe, this is Jack. We're eating here. Won't be too long at it, but if you've got any significant news or anything, why don't you give it to us?
|CAPCOM|Jack, I don't know if it's significant news but at least I know you will be interested. Both your demand rates look good now. We show no evidence of a leak there and it may have been that just recycling them reseated them, and solved whatever problem we had. You can go ahead with the 02 recharge on the PLSS and the water recharge at your convenience, and let me poll the room here for other news items. Over.
|CERNAN| the CDR's PLSS, 10 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 03:44CST 150:51GET MC605/1
150:51:00|CAPCOM|Challenger, this is Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead, Joe.
|CAPCOM|Roger, this is a news report to eat by. I'll combine an orbital science report with a sports report, an unusual combination here. I'll start out with a sports report on Monday night football, which you may not have heard yet; Joe Namath tried mightily to lead the New York Jets into the American Football League playoffs but the Oakland Raiders grounded the Jets in a 4th quarter 24 to 16 blitz. Namath passed for more than 400 yards but in spite of it, New York scored only 1 touchdown. Moving along to the successes of Captain America I'll rundown different items in the SIMBAY here. Beginning with the UV spectrometer, in general the data has been excellent. We're getting indications that the hydrogen atmosphere of the Moon is much less than expected - in fact, I don't think we're detecting any but rather setting a limit on the amount of hydrogen around the Moon. There was an Aerobee launch - or an attempt at an Aerobee launch - from White Sands on Monday to calibrate solar UV radiation but this launch failed because an instrument viewing port in the rocket failed to open. A second launch - let's see - was scheduled, I think, for today and I don't know whether that was successful or not. I guess it will be launched later today. The infrared scanning radiometer is performing beautifully. Indications are that subsolar point surface temperatures are higher than we've detected from our Earth based observations before. We're seeing many thermal anomalies, particularly in Procellarum and in the Procellarum area west of Copernicus. And, we're seeing also a few unusual cold spots which apparently are indicating areas of very fine soil with a few or no blocks in and on the soil. The Lunar Sounder Data is beautiful and the power monitor signals we find correlate with the surface features. And, the HF data indicates to us that we are detecting a variety of layers in the Mare area.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, this is Jack. Do you know where specifically they're seeing the hot spots west of Copernicus?
|CAPCOM|Jack, I don't have it on the page in front of me here. We're going to check into it and I'll get back to you in a second,
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston. With regard to your questions on the hot spot, apparently they've not yet indexed the - these warmer sources that they're detecting to the CSM (garbled) and so they don't know exactly what they correspond to as far as the surface features themselves go. So, I can't help you on that right now.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe. Just curious.
|CAPCOM|And, Jack, (garbled) handed me some numbers which I think you will be interested in. From the EVA 2 EMU summary the elapsed EVA time was 7 hours plus 37 minutes plus 22 seconds for a new outdoor record under
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12 /13/72 03:44 CST 150:51 GET MC605 /2
150:51:00|CAPCOM|(continued) international rules. The rest of the sheet looks free from pproblems in a comforting way. Let's see, average metabolic rates, for you, Geno, 855 and Jack, you're running at around 9 20 . That, relative to premission averages of around 850 - and you have a grand total EVA time now of 14 hours 49 minutes and 35 seconds. CHALLENGER - Very interesting numbers, Joe. Do you have any idea how the metabolic rate compared to yesterday?
|CAPCOM| Good question, let me ask on that one. Yesterday you were running at 1045 and 1090 so you're down considerably from your work rates of yesterday, which is good news. Maybe you're learning how to do it more easily or something like that.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, but we spent a lot of time riding today and a lot of time working yesterday.
|CAPCOM|That's true. But, I guess that's not taken into the consideration of the average here. Certainly true - we can ask for the metabolic rate of the Rover. I'll bet that is pretty impressive for today.
|CHALLENGER|Well, don't get me wrong, driving that Rover is fine, but I'll tell you, it keeps your attention.
|CAPCOM|I'm sure it does.
|CHALLENGER|It keeps your passenger's attention, too.
|CAPCOM|I'm sure it does. We noted from comments when you were rolling along today - reading between the lines from time to time.
|CHALLENGER|Actually, Joe, for good long periods on at the run up to station 2, except when we had to pick our way up the hole in the wall, I was running at full bore at anywhere from, I guess, what did I say, 10 to 12 to 15 clicks - I didn't hit 15 going up very much. Coming down I did, but its really a standby for turn and watch where you're going type of run, because the small craters, of course, are the ones that can really jolt you. But the troubl is, you can't - you can never see what's just over the next ridge and the next ridge may be 20 meters away and you just can't see it until you're there and you don't know whether its a dish crater or pit crater.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. We copy that.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, that-
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|That description - that description fits the geology up in there because we weren't seeing blocky rim craters and otherwise you would have been able to tell more easily about the old versus new craters which would be the ones you could either go through or not go through respectively.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|That's a super machine to drive though, Joe, I'll tell you. If you had enough time you could really learn to take it all the way but you don't really do that just the second time around.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12 /13/72 03:44 CST 150:51 GET MC605 /3
150:51:00|CAPCOM|Geno, was it spraying dirt at you today? Did you notice that you still missed the real fender and that the patch fender wasn't quite doing what maybe it could?
|CHALLENGER|No sir, I don't think we missed it at all. Fact is, we're recommending a design change, Joe.
|CAPCOM|That will be for next year's model. CAHLLENGER1That's right.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 04:02 CST 151:09 GET MC-606/1
151:09:00|CHALLENGER|Hey, Joe is it all right to use the waste management system?
|CAPCOM|Rog, we're happy with those demand regs now, and you can proceed on with that and including all the PLSS recharges that you need to do as well.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, we're filling my PLSS with water now, you might check on the water quantity.
|CAPCOM|Roger, thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, that should take care of my PLSS for tonight.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, thank you. Out of curiosity, have you packed - or are you packing the ETB now?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, Jack's doing it right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got a last minute change. We show that your mag Bravo is at about 77 frames and we would like for you to just leave it in the ETB, it's already in the ETB and take it out with you tomorrow. We can shoot up the remaining frames if we run out of film otherwise.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, fine. That goes along with our thinking.
|CAPCOM|You know apparently you made some comment earlier in the day about being bothered by comm noise during your egress from Challenger, did that go away right away or did it just cease to bother you or what - what was the story on that?
|CHALLENGER|I don't remember, so it must have gone away because the comm was great.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's what we kind of assumed.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're charging Jack's PLSS with oxygen.
|CAPCOM|Sounds good.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger, the 02 is complete on the - 02 fill is complete on the LMPs PLSS and we're working on the water.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, for information, we're coming up on a comm handover in about 1 minute and a half.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 4:36 GET 151:43 607/1
151:43:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 151 hours 46 minutes. Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan appear to be completing the last few items on the checklist before getting to sleep. We hope to get them to bed within an hour or maybe even a bit less, which would put them about an hour behind the nominal flight plan. Ron Evans aboard America is now in his 33 revolution of the Moon. That spacecraft currently in an orbit 69.3 by 53.6 nautical miles. Evans began an 8 hour sleep period at 146 hours 40 minutes ground elapsed time, which is right on the flight plan. And he's scheduled to end that sleep period at 154 hours 40 minutes. The pan camera - mapping camera, and laser altimeter in the CSM scientific instrument module bay, have been turned off. The infrared scanning radiometer - the ulraviolet spectrometer are both in the operating mode during the sleep period. And data indicates nominal performance for both.
|CHALLENGER|LMP's PLSS is charged.
|CAPCOM|We copy it.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, how has the weather gotten down there? Any better?
|CAPCOM|Geno, the weather is better. We were really socked in yesterday, as the fronts moved on through the Houston area. And it's cold and clear tonight, I suspect. ,1It's been a while since we've been out, but they're calling for it to go down right near freezing.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, thank you.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 152:15 CST 5:09 MC 608/1
152:15:00|CHALLENGER|Hey, Joe, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, succeeded leveling the gravimeter yet?
|CAPCOM|Jack, we'll check it. Update our information on that. My understanding at the moment is that they've not, but they're thinking that the unit's just too cold and during the process of warming it up by dumping heat into it by running some of the equipment around it in it, and they by no means given up - given up hope for that unit.
|CHALLENGER|I figure that means that my fooling around with it didn't help them.
|CAPCOM|Apparently it didn't do too much for them, but what it did do was convince them that probably somehow locked up because it's temperature's not right yet. But they're not worring about whether it's level or not level now. They're confident that it's been set up okay. And now they're just biding their time to bring that temperature up. We'll get some more words to you sometime tomorrow on it as you make your traditional visit to the site again - ALSEP site again probably. How are you coming along with your sleep prep?
|CHALLENGER|Ah, just about there, Joe. We picked up some time somewhere in here. Couldn't be much more than an hour behind.
|CAPCOM|No, that's just about right. You're looking pretty good on that. You get to sleep in the next 5 minutes, you're 1 hour behind.
|CHALLENGER|Yes sir, I'm putting my hammock up now as a matter of fact. What are you doing up so late?
|CAPCOM|Well, somebody's got to sit up and keep you guys honest. I think we're getting more sleep down here than you are.
|CHALLENGER|Ah me.
|CAPCOM|I might add that not only do we have to stay up late, we have to get up mighty early to keep you honest too.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you going to let us sleep 8 hours or what?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, Jack, we're looking good on the time and we're not only - will you get - we hope 8 hours of good sleep but you'll have a full EVA tomorrow. So it's not costing us anything there.
|CHALLENGER|Sounds great, Joe. I fully expect it won't be much longer now,
|CAPCOM|And Gene, just for rough planning purposes, we'll start to figure your sleep period starting around 152:30. And we'll be looking at your getting up around 8 hours from that t i me .
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Joe, I'11 buy that.
|CAPCOM|Might add also that there are a lot of us
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 152:15 CST 5:09 MC 608/2
152:15:00|CAPCOM|looking forward to that third EVA tomorrow. It' s going to be the last one on the lunar surface for some time.
|CHALLENGER|I tell you if it's anywhere near what the first two were like, we're looking forward to it also.
|CAPCOM|Gene and Jack, we're still marveling at the beautiful television pictures that we're getting from your TV camera there. It's fun in fact, to watch the tracks that you're leaving behind in the lunar soil - both footprints and Rover tracks. And some of us are down here now reflecting on what sort of mark or track will someday disturb the tracks that you leave behind there tomorrow.
|CHALLENGER|That's an interesting thought, Joe, but I think we all know that somewhere, someday someone will be here to disturb those tracks.
|CAPCOM|No doubt about it, Gene.
|CHALLENGER|Don't be too pesimistic, Joe. I think it's going to happen.
|CAPCOM|Oh, there's no doubt about that. But it's fun to think about of what sort of - of devise that will ultimately disturb your tracks.
|CHALLENGER|Well, that devise may look something like your little boy.
|CAPCOM|Why, he'd make short work of them.
|CHALLENGER|Joe, I'll tell you it's also a pretty philosophical thought to think that you're riding around out here on what is really undisturbed - undisturbed everything, you know. If there was someone here, way back when sometime they didn't leave much - much sign of their whereabouts but, that's an interesting thought too. As you drive you cause your own Rover tracks and figure out those are the only ones that have - that maybe have ever been here.
|CAPCOM|Very true.
|CHALLENGER|And with that I'm rolling out my hammock. Okay, Joe, I'm waving goodnight to you, I'm rolling up my overhead window cover.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene and Jack, we'll say goodnight to you from down here, unless there's someother way we can help you.
|CHALLENGER|No sir. If there is we'll give you a call, t hough.
|CAPCOM|Just want to end by saying what a terrific job you did today and really looking forward to tomorrow. Have a good 8 hours rest.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you Joe. Tomorrow we answer all the unanswered questions. Right?
|CAPCOM|If not more.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 26 minutes. The goodnights with the crew aboard Challenger were exchanged at 152 hours 25 minutes, and we plan to give them a full 8 hour sleep period which puts wakeup at 160 hours 25 minutes. That presumably
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 152:15 CST 5:09 MC 608/3
152:15:00|PAO|would move the start time for the EVA 3 back 1 hour. We'll be getting conformation on that shortly. And both the CSM and the lunar module continuing to perform almost perfectly as planned. Based on the telemetry that we're getting here on the ground and at this moment our large scribing plotter display in front of mission control, shows the command module America to be passing almost directly over Challenger on the lunar surface in the Valley of Taurus Mountains. America now on its 33 revolution of the Moon. And Ron Evans well into his scheduled 8 hour sleep period. Evans is right on the planned time for sleep. Sleeping right on the - on the flight plan times. During the sleep period we'll have the air-to-ground lines down. Normally that circuit gets rather noisy after the crew's gone to sleep - configured the lunar module to sleep. The power amplifier is turned off, the transmitter output power of the lunar module decreased from about 18 watts down to about 1 watt and that accounts for the noise that we frequently have on that circuit during sleep periods. For that reason, we will have the circuit down configured to record any conversations with the crew for subsequent playback. At 152 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 153:27 CST 0620 MC 609/1
153:27:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 153 hours 27 minutes. We have heard nothing from the crew aboard Challenger on the lunar surface, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt, for the past hour since we said goodnight to them. And we now have a little less than 7 hours until their scheduled wakeup time. We plan to wake them up at a GET time of 160 hours 25 minutes which would be 8 hours after we said goodnight to them. Ron Evans aboard the command module, America, is about to begin his 34th revolution of the Moon, and on this revolution we'll be sending Ron a wakeup call. Wakeup for him is 154:40, 154 hours 40 minutes. It'll be about 35 minutes before we regain radio contact with the CSM as it comes back around the eastern rim of the Moon on its 34th revolution. Both vehicles continuing in very good shape. One minor problem appeared to crop up with the lunar module following the repressurization after the 2nd EVA. The cabin pressure went up to about 5.8 pounds per square inch. This is about 8 tenths of a pound above what we think of as the normal LM cabin pressure. However, it is not unusual to see the cabin pressure spike up a bit on repress urization and then drop back down. However, this rise was getting fairly close to the pressure of which the cabin relief valves would open and relieve the pressure. One consideration when the pressure goes up in this manner is that perhaps one of the several sources of oxygen in the LM cabin might be leaking,1. such things as the portable life support system fill valves or the portable life support system itself, or one of the oxygen purge systems, or even the the main regulator valves that control the flow of oxygen from the LM supply tanks in the cabin. After isolating these possible sources one at a time, and still watching the pressure rise gradually, we elected to shut down both of the oxygen regulator valves and see what happened to the pressure, keeping a flow of oxygen through the cabin to remove carbon dioxide buildup, and on shutting down both regulators, the pressure did, in fact, begin to drop. The assumption at that time was that possibly one of the regulators was leaking slightly, allowing a small amount of oxygen above the needs of the crew and for replenishment, to flow into the cabin. And as the pressure dropped back down, we brought one regulator at a time on line. However, the pressure continued to fall back to its normal level of about 5 pounds per square inch even with both regulators on. So, at this point, the assumption is that nothing is the matter. There are a couple of possible explanations for the rise in cabin pressure. One is - one explanation is that one of the regulators was, in fact, leaking, and when they were recycled and reseated, the seal held properly and the regulators are now performing properly. The other possibility is that moisture from the suit circuits - the temperature rise caused by bringing things from outside the LM into the lunar cabin - rocks and other equipment that had been exposed to the Sun on the lunar surface - causing an increase in water vapor, carbon dioxide, and the slight rise in the cabin temperature, which would, in turn, bump the pressure up. Those are probably the most likely possibilities. In any event, the situation as it now stands is that the LM cabin's pressure is at 4.9 pounds per square inch which is within the normal range and there's no indication of any leakage either through the regulators or through the other sources of oxygen. It appears that everything is functioning normally. During this shift in Mission Control, flight director Gene Kranz has his flight control team reviewing the situation for liftoff. This team of flight controllers will be in charge of the lunar liftoff and they are considering such things as the ideal time to conduct the plane change maneuver with the command module, to put it in the proper orbit for subsequent rendezvous with the lunar module; also, looking at LM veights and performance characteristics, assuring that all that data is in proper form before the liftoff which we expect will occur at the flight plan time. EVA 3 will be, it looks like now, delayed 1 hour from the published flight plan time. This reflects the late sleep time for the crew, the fact that they began to translate to a one hour late start for EVA 3, and the EVA's plan for a full 7 hours duration. At 15 3 hours 33 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.

|CAPCOM|Glad to hear it Ron, good morning.
|AMERICA|Good morning.
|AMERICA|I slept with my light weight ^adset last night so I didn't have to have that cap on, is the fidelity of this thing any good at all?
|CAPCOM|Pretty, good, Ron, pretty good. And, as you start your morning's activities, you can be aware hat we were watching the spacecraft through the night and as fligh puts it everything is swinging.
|AMERICA|Outstanding, that s what we like.

|CAPCOM|We start work early around here.
|AMERICA|Well, I guess.
|AMERICA|Hey, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|AMERICA|Joe, just to be kind of curious, how - how the old heart rate compares compares to those sleep tests that we'did preflight - or say is it about the same -when I'm soundly asleep or is it more, or what, you know.
|CAPCOM|Stand by Ron, and 1*11 ask the men on the LM,,
|AMERICA|Okay, maybe they'll have that information.
|CAPCOM|Rog. They think maybe 5 minutes. We'll be back to you.
|AMERICA|Okay. No problem. Curiosity, more than anything.
|AMERICA|I didn't get quite as much sleep last night. I took a bath, changed my underwear, and all those good deal things, huh. Oh, I probably got -oh, maybe 7 hours at the most. Probably closer to 6 1/2 good sleep.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|And I'll give you the rest of that in just a jiffy when I get her all squared away.
|CAPCOM|Okay.

154:54:00|CAPCOM|Hello, America, this is Houston.
|AMERICA|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. Apparently, in your preflight data base, they show you with a rate of - in the low 60's or high 50's. That's a sleeping rate, and we're showing you now, during your sleep periods of - heart rates of about 10 beats lower per minute, and with heart rates that show less variation than the preflight data shows.
|AMERICA|Ahah, okay, thank you much. The heart does slow down a little bit up here then.
|CAPCOM|Apparently so, they assured me, however, that it would not be approaching zero so you can relax there.
|AMERICA|(laughter) Okay.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, in the meantime, Gordo's arrived here, and I'll turn the console over to him. Be talking to you later, perhaps.
|AMERICA|Okay, Joe. Thank you much. Appreciate. it. .
|CAPCOM|Enjoyed it, have a good day. We'll all be watching you close.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, America. Here is my medi cal log.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Good morning.
|AMERICA|I just noticed I'm a day off. (laughter) Okay, Gordo, glad to have you aboard with us. Okay, PRD 15041 and the sleep I mentioned, probably 6-1/2 or 7 good hours. I took a seconal last night, and I had 4 cans of fluid.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, here's the old chow for day 6.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, cinnamon toast with bread cubes, orange juice, cocoa with potassium, and a vitamin pill. Okay, a lobster bisque, all the peanut butter, all the jelly, 3 pieces of bread, citrus beverage, and tea, a chocolate bar, and a package of pecans. And I had a beef steak, butterscotch pudding, and an orange drink.
|CAPCOM|Okay, got that.
|AMERICA|I think that was it. Let's see, today I've got sausage, grits, fruit cocktail, orange beverage and coffee.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|And I hope you have one of those preflight - not preflight, but what do you call it - geology summaries of EVA 2 like you had yesterday. I thought that was great.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, I just picked it up. Let me read it over and then I'll give you a summary.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay, sure no problem.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 07:58 CST 155:05 GET MC-613/1
155:05:00|CAPCOM|Hello, Ron, I'll give you a little summary here of the EVA. It's going to be a little rambling, we haven't had time to organize it, but it was a very interesting night last night on the second EVA.
|AMERICA|Sure, no problem, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Traverse lay over terrain of extPAOrdinary geologic diversity and yielded a far greater variety of information than every obtained on any other lunar traverse. Systemic descriptions and samples of 4 of the 6 main units of, the area, massifs, sub-floor, the light mantle and the darlc mantle, were obtained. In addition, detailed descriptions!were given of a variety of craters, including exciting discoveries at the crater Shorty, and descriptions.of the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and lineaments in the hilly terrain. The South Massif is composed of two main varieties of breccia: Blue-grey and tan-grey blocks of both varieties were abundant at Station 2 up by Nansen. I won't go into the geologic details on those breccias, but they then found samples of the sub-floor unit exposed as blocks in the ejecta around larger craters that have been partly buried by the dark mantle. Stand by. Okay, they're gonna take the antenna away from us, Ron. I'll have to finish this next time around. Spacecraft's looking good, talk to you in about 45 minutes or so.
|AMERICA|Okay, mighty fine, Gordo, thank you.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 155 hours 11 min utes ground elapsed time. Even though there are some 4 mirutes and 25 seconds remaining to actual disappearance of the spacecraft America behind the Moon, the network has taken down the uplink to the spacecraft so, for all practical purposes, we have had loss of signal to Ron Evans aboard spacecraft America. We'll see him again in about 48 minutes. Meanwhile the crew of lunar module Challenger is still asleep at Taurus-Littrow, To reiterate the new wake-up time for the Challenger crew it's ground elapsed time of 160 hours 25 minutes with the start of EVA 3 coming at 163:40, which is approximately 1 hour later than the Flight Plan. Current orbit measurements of spacecraft America: 69.6 by 53.5 nautical miles. As the spacecraft disappeared behind the Moon, the velocity in orbit was 5372 feet per second. The Gold Team of Flight Directors or Flight Controllers settling in for a fairly short day shift ending at 2:00 p.m., just after the surface crew has been wakened. Gerry Griffin In charge of the LM (lunar module) flight controllers and the CSM group headed up by Neil Hutchinson. At 155:13 ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 08:53 CST 156:00 GET MC614/1
156:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 156 hours ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Coming up on acquisition of signal in about 50 seconds the command module, America, coming around on her 35th lunar orbit. Command module pilot, Ron Evans, awake at this time, should be completing his breakfast and ready for a days work in lunar orbital science. Meanwhile the crew of Challenger on the lunar surface still asleep. About 4 1/2 hours until they're awakened for the third and final EVA of this mission and of the Apollo program. Waiting for confirmation in about 5 seconds or perhaps a few more seconds that network has indeed locked onto the signal from spacecraft, America. we'do have acquisition. Let's join the air-ground 2 circuit for any conversation during this 35th front-side pass.
|AMERICA|Houston, this is America. I see you tried to come in there.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Ron, you're loud and clear.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm just finishing up my fruit cocktail,
|CAPCOM|Okay, while you're munching there, let me give you a few status reports here. First of all your RCS is clicking right along there 4 percent above the flight plan line, however we have some plans for that 4 percent, which I'll go over with you later. On the oxygen - you've gained a little on it - since I was last on, anyway. 02 tank 1 is a little low but it's balanced by tank 3 being a little high and tank 2 is right on the red line so I think they all balance out to be about on the red line - on the flight plan line and they all three balance out to be right on the flight plan line, as close as I can tell. Hydrogen - You're probably up about 4 percent in- tank 1 and the other 2 are right on the line so you're in good shape there, still.
|AMERICA|Very good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, while you're - I've got some words on - on your orbit here which won't require anything - writing down anything. But for some reason you're missing the vascons or something and you're orbit is not degrading like we expected it to. It's not degrading down into circular orbit. It's - I think it's staying just about the way it was. And so we're looking ahead to plane change and we're thinking about an extra maneuver prior to plane change - about one hour prior to plane change on the back side. There was some discussion here about what to call that maneuver. Somebody wanted to call it a HAM, a height ajust maneuver, but someone else said, "Well, that one's already used in the rendezvous sequence. Maybe we ought to make it BACON." And even LOX was suggested
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 08:53 CST 156:00 GET MC614/2
156:00:00|CAPCOM|considering the FIDO's of - objected to BACON because of his religion. So LOX was eliminated because we've already used that for the S-IVP.
|AMERICA|How about Vascon Adjust.
|CAPCOM|Anyway, what the maneuver is going to be - whatever we call it, , is about about a 11 foot per second RCS burn one hour prior to plane change. So that will be on the back side. And that will just about use up your RCS overage and put you back on the flight plan line. That will adjust the height when you get around to the plane change and then the plane change will be a little bigger than originally planned. It's showing about 365 feet per second SPS of course. And looking at the consumables, that will put you down right on the rescue red line on SPS, so we're still in good shape that - consumable wise.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 09:00CST 156:07GET 615/1
156:07:00|CAPCOM|Further tracking will resign this, of course, so we'll have updates on the plan. Any questions on that. Over.
|AMERICA|No, it sounds like ya'll thought it up and I appreciate letting me know about that. Is the timeline worked out good enough in there - working a P41. I guess it does an hour before.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, well, we'll make it. I haven't looked at it myself but we - SAO has and I have a good idea of what needs to be changed if anything. Okay. On the SIM bay basically there's nothing new to report and all the people down here appreciate your timely operation of the SIM bay and it's responsible for really maximizing the data return. In general we're pretty happy. The problems that we're having with it are ones that have already been mentioned to you. On the HF antenna retrack problem - that we have - if we haven't - here is the plan. Well, first of all, the consensus on that is that we really think the antennas are retracting okay -that it's a malfunction in the limit switch that drives the talk back - that's really the problem. But we have devised an alternate method - utilizing timing and stall current and actually the signature of the motor stall current down here in the data to determine proper retraction and at just prior to 168 hours in the flight plan, you're supposed to re track those antennas and we're going to check the data at that time and say yes or no they are retracting or they aren't. If they don't, then the ultimate plan we'll swing into at that time is to reschedule the HF targets that are now scheduled on REV 55. Reschedule them and do them on REV 42. After which, we'll try one more time to retract the antennas and if it still looks like they indeed are not retracting I guess it's just the one that's in question. That we'll go ahead and jettison on the - at that time and we'll still have gotten most of the -at least priority HF targets with that alternate plan. Over. MAERICA1Hey, that sounds like a good plan to me.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got one request from EECOM here. Can you turn the H2 tank 2 fans off, please.
|AMERICA|H2 tank 2 fans are off now.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And when you get between courses of breakfast there, I have some pencil work for you in the way of the flight plan updates - not too much really. MAERICA1Okay, contrary to the way I eat breakfast on the ground. I always end up leaving my orange juice 'till last. I guess that's the case - I'm going to have to eat the hot meal first.
|CAPCOM|fir, g.
|AMERICA|Well I'll tell you the only thing I've got left to eat is orange juice and I'm ready to copy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 156 22 which is coming up here. I'd like to at that time verify all command module VHF's OFF. You're now 11 after - you have to terminate the jett on monitor and get the sounder operating I can break this off at anytime if you think we're pressing that. Just interrupt me. At 156 50 lunar sounder pad G start is 156:51:05, and G stop is 156 56 09. Over.

156:07:00|AMERICA|Okay, G start 156 51 05, 156 56 09.
|CAPCOM|That's good. Flip the page - flip two pages and copy the next sounder pad which is for 158 40. G start is 158 49 35, and stop time is 158 -

|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, I've got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, G start
|AMERICA|Go ahead now butterfly.
|CAPCOM|158 49 35 and stop is 158 54 38.
|AMERICA|Okay, start 158 49 35, 158 54 38.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's correct. Now on that same page, 158 13, after pan camera on, add a line that says V over H override, high altitude.
|AMERICA|Okay, 158 13, V over H override to high altitude.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and at 158 -
|AMERICA|I think it's still in high altitude from yesterday, yeah it is.
|CAPCOM|Okay. 158 21 is another verify all command command VHF off.
|AMERICA|Okay, at 158 21 verify all VHF off and I know what that means.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the next two are easy. Next page, at 159 01, just draw a line through mapping camera retract and at 159 05 -
|AMERICA|Okay, I've got it1.
|CAPCOM|Draw a line through mapping camera laser altimeter cover closed.
|AMERICA|Okay, got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I think we're caught up. We're ready for high gain auto.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'll bo back and see where we are on the old flight plan.
|AMERICA|Okay, you have auto.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, I don't think this light weight headset is quite as good as the other one and I'm going to change as soon as I get a chance here.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, VHF A is OFF, B is OFF and C GARBLE. P data is OFF, beacon is OFF, ranging is OFF. That's all. (Laughter).
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|I was looking at Akin when it came around that side. Akin is almost right in the terminators right now. So when you come up on terminator photos there - the only thing is that even though it was down in the shadows down at the bottom of the crater, I could still see the bottom of the craters - when they come around there for the near - terminators photography. I'm going to open the camera up and take a picture down in the shadow itself and see if that works.

|AMERICA|Cause there was quite a bit of backlight *- quite a bit of backlight reflection from the northeastern side of it and1, also the eastern side of it I guess. It's pointing down in the eastern ; rim -1;
|CAPCOM|Say Ron, if you'll give us ACCEPT we'll give you a vector while you got it.
|AMERICA|The only way I can describe it — okay, vou have ACCEPT1'
|CAPCOM|Roger1;
|AMERICA|And additional clear.
|AMERICA|With the shadow effect on the eastern - I guess the east and southeastern into your rim of the crater it reminds me a lot of some eroded -'
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 09:10 GET 156:17 MC-616/1
156:17:00|AMERICA|eroded hills. Like if you've got a valley that maybe has a 20 foot - it's bigger than that - but, say I've got a 20-foot drop on the thing where it's been just rain erosion down the side and it kind of washes little - little valleys down it here and there and leaves mounds and humps inbetween that haven't erroded away yet. And that's the side of that crater looks. Now, the other side of it, the northeastern rim of it and the interior rim looks just like one a - one of the massif units. That is, it's a very fine texture, no real erosion processes, just a smooth gentle slope.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. It's your computer go back to Block.
|AMERICA|Okay, we're at Block.
|AMERICA|You know that Skylab drink pack has really been a pretty good deal. Because you can use the nipple that's on the end of that thing, and use it for all of the beverage packages. And that way you don't have to cut open the end of it and let it drip out all over the place.
|CAPCOM|Hey, on that (garble) Skylab (garble).
|AMERICA|(garble) nipple in it.
|AMERICA|I'm not sure if they have any of our beverage packs or not. I think they're all packaged in these expandable little things we're using for water cans.
|CAPCOM|I see.
|AMERICA|Say, Gordo, what day is this?
|CAPCOM|Had to think there myself. It's Wednesday. It's about 9:15 in the morning, Wednesday.
|AMERICA|Ah, ha. Thank you. I guess I could have figured it up but -
|CAPCOM|That's why we're here, to answer important questions.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) that's right. Hey, getting ready for (garble) to standby. That's verifying.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|The recorder is - Radar is on, recorder is off, not heaters. Let's see, the old mode is still VHF. Ah, ha, get to control the spacecraft again. (garble). It takes about 5 minimum impulse blips to get a lOtli of a degree per second.

156:28:00|AMERICA|Well, the dark canyon around - around Serenitatis as you look north the dark variation there and kind of looking back - looking a little bit backwards now isn't that dark, as though continuity which is (garble) all, goes right down the middle of the ridges. As you look directly east of Littrow - east - I mean directly west of Littrow, the (garble) is there, and then there's comes out at you and you have the light tan - tannish - tannish dark I guess you'd call it dark tanish grey and then you get out to the light tan of the mare Serenitatis itself.
|CAPCOM|Okay Ron.
|AMERICA|I was looking almost directly into the Sun and you can still see a topographic expression - topographic high around the rilles in the Tacquet area and also the greyness has disappeared out of that - out of that dark material and it just in looking into the Sun it looks more of tan, a darker tan than the Serenitatis area and you can also see the topographic rise to it. Now I'm looking quite a ways away from it and looking down on it.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|AMERICA|You know that kind of funny. Now looking back Sulpicius Gallus and just to the north of that there's a crater that's about well it's right at the end of those rilles that go north from Sulpicius Gallus and you can really see the ejecta blanket. The ejecta blanket looks very dark around it. Now in this Sun you look out across the Mare Serenitatis now and you get toward sunset looking back into the Sun and the color is disappearing all except from that one spot. Now that must be either a fresh ejecta as you lose the brightness of it or something either that or its dark, it's sure a dark a dark ejecta blanket around it. The blanket itself goes out maybe 2-3 crater diameters and it looks like it has kind of a ray-type pattern to it. Oh, about that crater, I don't even know if it's got a name or not, but I'll mark it on my map .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Now that I've got the day, it must be time to do something.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, it's time to turn the recorder on.
|AMERICA|Recorder on - recorder's on.
|CAPCOM|Okay.

So, we've got to you at - ah - there's kind of a little bit of a mare area down there. Okay, I think it is. And, you can see lava tongues sticking out through there and lava flow fronts with the high side on the east side, because you've got a shadow all the way along the front. And they're about ah -In that one area you might consider a scalloped area, an ejecta scallop, but coming out of that one area, you can see a crazy lava flow coming out from it.
|CAPCOM|Roger on that.
|AMERICA|The reason the flow -
|AMERICA|These are Apennines I'm just going over, aren't they?
|CAPCOM|That's right. That's what they ought to be. We need the IR - » .;,
|AMERICA|You look back across the - Okay.
|CAPCOM|I need the IR cover closed, please.
|AMERICA|Say, again, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|We want the IR cover closed, right away.
|AMERICA|Okay, it's going closed. Okay, it's closed. How about the EV? IR cover is closed.
|AMERICA|I was just going to say, looking back across Mare Serenitatis into the sun, now, there must be Bessel. There's an ejecta pattern out there - When you -look at the ejecta patterns into the sun, they all look black with respect to the Mare. I think it must be a shadow affect or something that you get off of the raised ejecta that comes up across it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Ron, that frantic call there was because the sun is starting to get into the IR and we'didn't, hadn't really thought that would happen, but, started to see it get in there, but you caught it in time. The tover saved it.
|AMERICA|Okay. Real good. I figured that's probably what it was.
|CAPCOM|Now, you can go ahead with the rest of the steps in there with the UV off after sunset.
|AMERICA|Okay. Mapping camera going OFF, covers closed to the IR so then we'll cut it off. Pan camera's off test, OFF. And let's see, I don't see the see the sun shining on the light out there, must be sunset. Yep. It sure enough is, though. Okay UV's going off. You want the IR covers back open just to keep things straight here?
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that. i
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 09:30 GET 156:37 MC-618/2
156:37:00|AMERICA|(garble) - Next time we use the IR let's1 just remember to open the cover.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just open it up the next time we use it, which is in about 15 minutes. We'll remind you on1I that if you forget.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay. - That's right - Okay. That's1j right these are just short science passes now, aren't they?
|CAPCOM|That's right.
|CAPCOM|Ron, I can finish up my description of the last night's EVA if you like, since there's nothing to look at now. I'm watching the clock on the Sounder start for you1!
|AMERICA|Okay. Yeah, appreciate it1j
|CAPCOM|Okay, I think I left off or was cut off there without mentioning 2 varieties of breccia in the South Massif. They found blue-grey and tan-grey, and without going into the geological details, those are the two types they found up there at Nansen. The subfloor unit was exposed as blocks and ejecta around larger craters has been partly buried by dark mantle. And craters have apparently penetrated within parts of the light mantle. Especially good samples :1were obtained from the rim of Camelot where the same textural characteristics which are banding caused by variations in vesicle concentration. Coarse grain-size and mineralogic features as reported in EVA 1 were found so, - END FO TAPE
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 09:40 CST 156:47 GET MC619/1
156:47:00|CAPCOM|As reported in EVA 1 were found so apparently this uni - unit is quite uniform over the distances that they've covered so far in the traverses. The prominent East facing scarp crossing the valley floor from north to south, about 5 kilometers west of the LM was traversed twice near the crater Lara near Hole-in the-Wall, although Hole—in—the—Wall appeared to be pretty subtle. No change in the surface characteristics or lithology of the mantle was discernalle where the astronauts traversed the scarp. Outcrops of boulders were observed farther to the north. Where the northward extension of the scarp crosses the face of the North Massif it forms a notably smooth and relatively young appearing surface. Elsewhere the surface of the North Massif is violently furrowed in textured. And the crew described it as a cross hatch pattern on the surface that they could see. One set of lineaments dipping eastward and the other westward at about 30 degrees. Some of the most interesting observations made during the EVA were - were related to craters. Many small craters within the dark mantle have glass coated central pits. Jack called them dimples. Some of the pits are nearly cylindrical and maybe half again as deep as the crater itself. Other small craters occuring on both the dark and light mantle have bright halos but these halos appear to be noticeably brighter on the light colored material. This bright material is not blocky or fragmental ejecta derived from a sub floor layer but rather, appears to consist of instant rock or soil breccia, which is then partly consolidated by the impact shock itself. The most interesting eureka during the EVA was at station 4, Shorty crater, where jack found some bright red or orange, he described it, orange dirt within the gray to dark gray rim materials. The colored banding is circumferential to the crater and resemble alteration halos which occur around many terrestrial volcanic vents. So you can see why the geologists are excited on that one. The morphology of Shorty, however, is similar in some respects -
|AMERICA|Yes sir you betch ya.
|CAPCOM|Impact craters, hence the size interpretation of it's origin may depend on sample analysis. And I've got about a minute and a half to start the sounder. You might be close to 2:30 there. If you aren't - They took a total of about 850 pictures. They've taken a total of 1270, would you believe, pictures so far on the lunar surface, including about 5 - 150 with the 500 millimeter camera. Mostly of the North, South, East Massifs and Family Mountain. They got
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 09:40 CST 156:47 GET MC619/2
156:47:00|CAPCOM|56 samples, 2 double cores, probably about 36 kilograms worth, and they traveled a total distance of 20 kilometers. Over.
|AMERICA|Hey, sounds like a good summary. They're finding all kinds of things up there. Which is the reason you're an explorer, I guess, to find - to see what you can find .
|CAPCOM|Yeah, they - they were really in their element last night. About 30 seconds to G start time. I'll let you call it yourself, though.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'll get it. Data systems are off. (garble) 05.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Hope this takes in that linear gabbro. Then you can find some sort of a photographic expression. To that light colored material around there. It looks to me like there is - right around the Reiner gamma itself.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Maybe the lunar sounder will collaborate by Moonlight investigations here or Earthlight investigations - I'm sorry. (laughter). While we're waiting here - I decided to sleep last night without being tied down or anything. So I selpt in the - what do you call them in the Navy? -
|CAPCOM|Hammocks, I think.
|AMERICA|Well. Anyhow, sleeping strings, we call them up here. Yeah, sleeping bags - some kind of sack. And the last 2 or 3 nights what I'd do is put the lap belt on loosely. And you know, it just kind of keeps you from rolling all over the cockpit. Then last night I didn't put it on at all and stayed in the sack. And I really didn't go too far anyhow. One time I woke up and I was crossways in the couch up here and then when I woke up this morning my feet were up in the tunnel. And my head was kind of still in the center couch, more or less. So you really don't roam around too much that way anyhow. Even if you aren't tied down. And you can get the "hug your pillow" effect by being inside that sack and laying your head on the outside of the sack. It just about fits me, except that if I stretch my feet out -then I get a little bit of a pull. Little bit of a pull -on it and it feels like you hug your pillow that way.
|CAPCOM|Kind of a security blanket effect, hull?
|AMERICA|(laughter) Yeah, right. That was the biggest problem the first 2 or 3 days here - What do you do with your head when you go to sleep. I'm used to sleeping
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 09:40 CST 156:47 GET MC619/3
156:47:00|AMERICA|with a pillow. And I'm used to sleeping on my side. And it's amazing the psychological effect that you can get from - for me it hard to go to sleep just laying on my back. So you can turn on your side and go right'to sleep. (laughter). What's your side - what's your back -I don't know but anyhow it works.
|CAPCOM|That's got to be psychological.
|AMERICA|(laughter). It sure is.
|AMERICA|5 6 7 8 mark it. Lunar sounder is standby.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 9:50 GET 156:56 620/1
156:56:00|AMERICA|Okay, recorder is going OFF.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Data systems coming ON.
|AMERICA|Okay, select power is ON.
|AMERICA|Again, we need to open the old door. IR OFF, barberpole, gray bar. I get the (garble) in here.
|CAPCOM|Forget some of that, Ron. Sounds like the mike might have slipped away from your mouth.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's a go od point - let me change my headsets here. Maybe I run right through the flight plan with all that stuff.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and -
|AMERICA|Also got the IR cover open.
|CAPCOM|Okay, great memory the re.
|CAPCOM|Ron, if you like, while you're getting ready for the 52, I can summarize the news real rapidly. There wasn't a whole lot.
|AMERICA|Okay, sure go ahead, I've got different headsets now, is that okay?
|CAPCOM|Yes, you're loud and clear. Former President Truman is still hanging in there. His heartbeat and breathing became unstable yesterday, but then improved again. Of course, the big headlines were about the discovery of the orange dirt at Shorty Crater. And there was a picture of Jan, John and Jamie in the paper watching the EVA on TV. The only thing new on the peace talks is that Kissinger will1. probably be coming back to the United States today and there's a rumor — the French Press said that the compromise is in the work on the withdrawal of the North Vietnamese troops from the south. The Rockets lost - the Aeros, the Hockey Team, won last night. They beat the Alberta Oilers. The Rockets lost to Buffalo. And the weather finally cleared out. The cold front cleared out the wet stuff and last night I think was the first time since you guys launched that we've had a look at the Moon so we had a direct look at you last night. It was just nice and sunny here this morning when I came to work. Ove r.
|AMERICA|Thanks for the news and I guess those 3 guys that went up to the Moon - you know, they probably cleared that weather up there in Houston.
|CAPCOM|It sure took you awhile though.
|AMERICA|(laughter) Right.
|AMERICA|Okay, 14 - this compass again, the same ones I had last night I think. That's Canopus. Canopus looks about as bright as Sirius, but not quite.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|My sextant is good in everything like that but you just can't quite get the radical in focus.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 9:50 GET 156:56 620/2
156:56:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|It's kind of the way they said it was going to be.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We copy those. Clear to torque them1
|AMERICA|Okay, let's see, we'll torque at - oh make it 0630.
|CAPCOM|Alrighty.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 10:00CST 157:06GET 621/1
157:06:00|CAPCOM|Ron, we've still got about 5 or 6 minutes until LOS but in case we'drop off on your maneuver in there - just want to tell you that everything's looking good. I think the IR is pumping out good data so with that fantastic team work we saved it back there and we'll see you next time around.
|AMERICA|Well, okay. Sounds good there's old Al- debaran in there. The center must still be out of the - there it goes - this is - Okay, wind the old GDCers.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of control from the spacecraft America, going behind the Moon, nearing the end of the 35th lunar orbit. That orbit measuring at this time 69.5 nautical miles by 53.6. There is a plan under consideration now for a small trim maneuver just prior to plane change maneuver. Some 12 feet per second with the RCS thrusters too tune up the orbit a little bit. This currently appears to be around 181 hours 33 minutes, with the plane change approximately an hour later. Command Module Pilot, Ron Evans continuing to operate the scientific instrument module experiments in the service module of his spacecraft. All systems apparently operating nominally. Three hours 13 minutes remaining until crew of Challenger is awakened at Taurus-Littrow landing site. And at 157:16 ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control1.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 10:53 CST 158:00 GET MC-622/1
158:00:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've acquired the command module, America coming around on the 36th rev. He's on a bad omni antenna at the moment, just barely readable, but we'll stand by here until the communications improve and Gordo Fullerton can continue the two-way communication.
|CAPCOM|Hello there, America, we hear your scratchy sounding omni.
|AMERICA|(laughter) Probably so.
|CAPCOM|You're readable but noisy.
|AMERICA|You're cutting in and out on the omni - I thought i couldn't get you.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Looks like we'll get the high gain here pretty quick (garble).
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Okay Houston, America, we probably have pretty good comm now huh?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Ron, we're getting you now and sound good.
|AMERICA|Okay, I don't have any observations to report from the backside. About time for blue bag number 4, somebody has got to develop a better mouse trap.
|CAPCOM|Roger on that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 11:03 CST 158:10 GET MC-623/1
158:10:00|AMERICA|Okay, pan camera's In stand by.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|AMERICA|(garble) Power's coming - power's coming on and V over H is in the high altitude.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay Ron, we're ready for self-test.
|AMERICA|Okay, going to self-test now. Barber pole.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Okay, by the way, Mag Lima Lima is empty, 165 frames showing there. Started Mag Mike Mike with frame number 95 finished the orbital science at 142. Took the crazy camera at 5.6/125th when I got ready to change to 5.6/250th I looked at the crazy thing and it was setting at F-ll. Maybe those first frames in there, maybe they can develop them a little different or something and still bring - get them to c ome out.
|CAPCOM|Okay Ron, we got that.
|AMERICA|I think what happens is I must have been holding the thing by the lens or something or I bumped the -the F stop - -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 11:10CST 158:17GET 624/1
|AMERICA|The f-stop thing somehow.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we're ready for pan camera to OFF and did you go to heaters after you set the sump test switch to sump test when we started this.
|AMERICA|No, I just went back to OFF, was I supposed to go to heaters?
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like it in heaters now.
|AMERICA|Okay, it's going to heaters and now it's spring-loaded to off and I just left it there. Okay going to heaters and now it's going to power is OFF.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, let's see are we ready for lunar sounder? It is blocked down here by panel 230 (laugh), not really I can look back and see the GARBLE. Okay, it's about time. Okay, lunar sounders verified and stand by. The recorder is going ON. Radar is going ON. And recorder OFF, not the heaters. If antenna 1 verify extend - no barberpole docked off - number 2 extend -no barberpole back to OFF. Okay, mode is going to HF and let me take a look at Alfa is OFF, Bravo is OFF. B data Is off, Beacon is OFF, ranging is OFF. Okay, let's see. 250 lens. Okay -5.6 - Infinity GARBLE. A - I can go the temporary storage bag, QQ goes off PLSS - 4 frames - that's going to be window 3. Okay, had his nose up against window 3 here - got to wipe it off. Boy these windows have really been great though. They haven't - don't have any coatings or anything like that on them.
|CAPCOM|Roger, on that.
|AMERICA|(GARBLE) there's little micro meteorite hit window 3 right in the middle of it - it looks like two of them out there - it's about - much smaller than a 32nd - 64th - a 64th in diameter probably. It's a little round. Doesn't seem to have any - it's just a pit, you know.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you said that was window 3.
|AMERICA|Window 3, yeah.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Ah, it scared me for a minute there. I was configuring for terminator photos and I looked on the near side terminator and I didn't see any unfortunately.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Stu and I were looking at the same thing. We're just about a 30 second minute I guess.
|AMERICA|Okay. One's of Aitkin on the far side, okay. Hitkin (?) and Iban - Hi-Ann or something like that, Debber Ibn Diann, yeah- You know you can come across the attack A area again and
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 11:20 CST 158:27 GET MC-625/1
158:27:00|AMERICA|There doesn't seem to be any — did you get this, a bright crater - a recent crater in the annulus - in that dark annulus the southern part of Serenitatis. It shows up again as that kind of a blue-grey brightness, as opposed to the tannish - tannish brightness of the - of the bright craters in Serenitatis. There's still is no Fair and Wrinkled Ridge - there's no color tone or differentiation in the Wrinkled Ridge area in this part of it. The only differentiation and it looks like south of Tacquet you get the same color tone variation occurs on over into Tranquillit atis. When you get to the Tacquet area, from Tacquet up to Milorisen. I wish I could remember the name of that crazy crater.
|CAPCOM|How about Manilius1.
|AMERICA|Manilius, that's it. Yeah. From Tacquet on up to Manilius now, the - that's got to be a buildup of material and it's more on the tan side than it is on the -more of a dark tan than it is to the tannish grey. So it's a different type of material than - than on the annulus down below the crater Tacquet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, you're saying this is sort of a angular plateau, then, that stretches across between Tacquet and Manilius?
|AMERICA|Yes, it is. It's an angular plateau in there and the plateau is got to have been coming from those rilles that are down in there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, do those - maybe you've already said this * do those wrinkle ridges cross the color boundaries?
|AMERICA|No, I can't find the Wrinkled Ridge that crosses the color boundary. The Wrinkled Ridges are at Serenitatis itself, and there is no color boundary on the western edge of Serenitatis. It's all the same.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Those sound like super good observation, Ron .
|AMERICA|And this side - I'm just passing over Sulpicius Gallus now. And just beyond Sulpicius Gallus -Sulpicius Gallus is out in the Mare Tranquillitatis itself, and it looks like you — it's either a talus slope, you know, you got a gentle slope of the - of the massif coming down and then it changes slope a little bit, and it looks like you have finer grained material. And that might be what we at one time or another called the high water mark, but I kind of believe that's just a talus change in the slope. As you go on down there in the fine grained material, somehow developing down the re in the bottom. But as soon as you cross that area — we're going west now from Sulpicius Gallus — again we've got the kind of the same tannish - a dark tan material that essentially covers the highland near this highland—type of an area here. It's a hummocky type material. There are a few rilles just north of Sulpicius Gallus; those rilles, again, have - have the dark tan _ material on it. About the same as the — same color tones that
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 11:20 CST 158:27 GET MC-625/2
158:27:00|AMERICA|you pick up from Tacquet to Manilius.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds great. Keep talking, we'll cue you as the flight plan events come up.
|AMERICA|Okay. De Caldera is sure fascinating. I'll try and take a quick look with the binocular on that one. Gosh I can't find it - there it is. I hope the pictures will kind of confirm a little bit of a topographic rise around the. DeCaldera, just a slight one and it's about half the width as you look at the "D", it's a half a width of the "D", not the height , but the width. And it seems to be raised, kind of a raised, flat rim around it. The color of the raised bumps down in the DeCaldera are the same as the surrounding material, around there. The bumps that are raised up are smooth looking and the depression for it has to be a Caldera I guess, or at least a part of the depression anyhow is a light bluish grey; I'll call it that way, very light bluish grey.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Ron I'm not suggesting you do, because it's probably trouble to find, have you tried the color wheel, comparing it on any of this stuff?
|AMERICA|(Laughter) No, I haven't. Let me try, that's a good idea though. I'll try that and see what I can come up with on that thing.
|CAPCOM|Well, don't go to a lot of trouble, I never got around to it, but you might peg down some of these colors a little better. It ticked me, when you were talking last night on the back side -
|AMERICA|That's a good point.
|CAPCOM|- on one of those passes about the green.
|AMERICA|Yeah.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're about 7 seconds away from where we're wanting the recorder on, Ron. Any time near here is fine.
|AMERICA|Okay, recorder - let's see, is on. Verified radar is on, remove HF, okay. You know to me, the Moon's got a lot more color than I've been led to believe. I kind of had the impression that everything was the same color. That's far from being true.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|I guess maybe we could say, perhaps color is in the eye of the beholder.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 11:30CST 158:37GET 626/1
158:37:00|CAPCOM|Say, perhaps color is in the eye of the b eholder1.
|AMERICA|I think there is a considerable amount of truth to that. Whistling.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron we'll take the mapping camera off, now.
|AMERICA|Okay, the old mapper is going off.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you're clear to go to standby on the mapping camera.
|AMERICA|Okay, mapper's going to standby. Motion up, barberpole. Camera1is OFF, pan camera soft test OFF. Okay, got the old slack power OFF1again. Consummer slack away feet power is OFF.

|AMERICA|Okay, cue-B center.
|AMERICA|OFF T Bravo
|AMERICA|Off, okay, data systems -
|CAPCOM|Okay, 30 seconds to T-start.
|AMERICA|Right, okay at 40 - okay, I got the high gain OFF. Got my.finger on the data systems, okay, data systems are going OFF, operate at 4935. Operate. 438. Give me a call Gordo. I'm going to look out the window here for a bit.
|CAPCOM|Sure will, Ron.
|AMERICA|A minute before that or so.
|AMERICA|The lights up, it might not be light adapt.
|AMERICA|I was trying to think if there was any thing I could add to the Re iner-Gamma observation there, I was right over that - the light albedo of that type of material that goes perpendicular between Reiner and Reiner-Gamma. It's kind of a crooked type - you know it goes for a little ways and then it breaks off into a dark albedo type stuff and then breaks off in another direction a little bit. So it doesn't look like a straight ray at all.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|You know, you can see crater holes and this type of thing. You look right down on Reiner now, and you've sure got that dark annulus - the lighter albedo type stuff is essentially in the middle of it and the annulus is - let's see maybe 30 kilometers wide by twice as long — it's a relative size, anyhow - by twice as long, and that's the dark area. And then around that - the light albedo stuff is about half of the width, and it's lighter on the outside than it is on the inside. The inside is not quite as light as the - I'd call it the rim, I guess. It's very hard to see any -
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Great, great, great topographic expression - the reason I say that is because it kind of blends in with everything whereas if you look at a crater out here in the middle of the Mare or a hill - you get a brighter - part of it's brighter than the surrounding territory, you can actually see the demarcation. So that's the way you get your depth perception out of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, about 30 seconds now until T-stop.
|AMERICA|Okay, T-stop is 5438 and we're going to stand by at that time. Base switch - 34567 stand by.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll give you a call in a minute.
|AMERICA|Okay.

|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Do, do, do, doodle do do.
|AMERICA|Houston, America. You might tell the medics not to pay any attention to those sample numbers ori those buses, pay attention to GET time, because when you take them out of the buses storage bag, the right one never comes out, so it makes any difference just pay attention to the GET time.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. I'll pass that along.
|AMERICA|Dun, dun, du dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,.
|AMERICA|Okay, guys, on Challenger, are they going to go out the regular time or are they getting a little extra sleep-period here or something.
|CAPCOM|I think we're letting them sleep in again, today. They're getting up 1 hour later than the flight plan shows, however, there's enough pad downstream that we're planning on ASCENT at the scheduled time.

|CAPCOM|You'll have to reconfigure the comm. And I suggest you wait on the dumps, as per the flight plan till after the photos. We estimate the waste water dump will take 10 minutes. Over,
|AMERICA|About 10 minutes on the waste water. Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, must be over low bit rate, okay low bit rate with data systems no DSE voice, I'll write everything down .
|AMERICA|Okay, we'll clip all the hoses and stuff hooked up down here.
|CAPCOM|Just about LOS, Ron, see you later.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordo, thank you much.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 159 hours 13 minutes ground elapsed time. We've had loss of signal, as Ron'Evans, flying the spacecraft America, passed behind the Moon nearing the end of revolution number 36. An hour and 16 minutes until Cernan and Schmitt, aboard Challenger are awakened for the third - for preparations for the third Moon Walk. America, now in an orbit measuring 69.1 by 53.7 nautical miles. We'll come back up at the next frontside pass by the spacecraft America in about 48 minutes, and switch over to the wakeup call to the Challenger partway through that 37th revolution. At 159:14 ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.

Less than 1 minute away now as the command module America, Ron Evans doing his orbital science tasks and orbital photography. As he comes around on revolution number 37; less than a half hour until the wake up call is made to the crew of Challenger on the lunar surface. At that time, we'll switch over to the air/ground 1 circuit and eavesdrop on the conversation between Ce rn an / S chmi 11 Cernan and Schmitt and the CAPCOM here in mission control. We should have acquisition of signal from command module America. We'll come up with that line now.
|AMERICA|(mumbling) Hey, guess my heaters off.
|CAPCOM|Hello, America, are you there ?
|AMERICA|Okay, we got REACQ (garble) now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're loud and clear.
|CAPCOM|Ron when it's convenient -
|AMERICA|Okay(garble) mag -
|AMERICA|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, on your present page there, the UV solar atmosphere PAD at 160:38.
|AMERICA|Ah ha, I have it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's T-start of 160:41:22. T-stop is 161:26:47, and a remark that goes with that, you don't need to write this down but, the T—start time is bias 10 seconds prior to when we really think sunset will occur. If you, visually, — okay, my mistake it's — the time is 10 seconds after sunset, but if see sunset visually, you can go ahead and proceed with the UV cover open as soon as you see it. But we'd like you to close the UV cover exactly on the T-stop time, as written, over.
|AMERICA|Okay, let's see, I'm with you. We'll make sure it gets closed at 61:26:47 but we can open it as soon as sunset comes, okay?
|CAPCOM|Ri ght.
|AMERICA|Even though we haven't started pitching yet.
|CAPCOM|That's correct and do you want to read back the s t art time ?
|AMERICA|Start time is 160:41:22, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's correct, 41:22.
|AMERICA|Okay.

159:57:00|AMERICA|Goodyj I got zodiacal ligbt coming up there sometime. One filter and all that. Oh, I started to say, when I was coming across Akin, of course Akin itself was down in the shadow and the Sun was really shining on window 3, I took the first one at 56 at a 15, second one 56, 5.6 I mean at a 30th and the third one at a l/60th and the fourth one at a l/25th and the fifth and sixth ones I took off to the north, looking off to the north out of window 4.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|And they were 5.6 at a 125th. I kind of doubt - it might work, but there was sure a lot of glare on the window. If it could get through that glare, well then we got it made.

|CHALLENGER|I don't know who took my water jug b ut it's gone.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Onboard (garble) been purged enough. I guess we'll turn that off.
|CHALLENGER|The big filler on here. I always leave the hose and everything disconnected. Stick it back behind this rock bag. Afraid I'll kick it. Break it off.
|CHALLENGER|You know, speaking of those rock bags.
|CHALLENGER|I had unzip those and Blow the air out of them every night. Wake up the next morning and they're full of air again justlike two big balloons down there.
|CAPCOM|How about that.
|CHALLENGER|(laughter) I'll honor it.
|CAPCOM|You can use one for the pillow you've been mis sing.
|CHALLENGER|(laughter) That's a thought. You could do that.

And, that's another spot where the dark material breaks down into the rim and also out on the outer outside of the rim. And, then you have that same type of impression at about 11 o'clock you've got a black streak going down inside the rim and it widens out going out toward a little crater out there on the outside of th e rim.

(Texas Aggies Fight Song)
|SCHMITT|I want you to say it first.
|CAPCOM|Hello, there, Challenger. The Gold Team Flight Director picked out the morning selection, and he says that if you can find some marroon dirt today instead of orange, you'll probably get a lot more cooperation out of h im.
|SCHMITT|I figured the Gold Team might do that. You know I've woke up to a lot of pleasant thoughts, but never to an Aggie before.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/.13/72 13:20 CST 160: 2 7 GET MC-6 33/1
00060::00|CHALLENGER|(garble) but never to an aggie before. Hey Gordo, don't forget I'm a gold - I' ma boiler maker.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|I feel like one right now. Tell the Gold Team Flight Director we'll find - just about anything he wants today.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll do that. The Challenger looks as good as ever, no problems at all through the night.
|CHALLENGER|That's outstanding, how's America?
|CAPCOM|It's in the same shape, just clicking along. Ron s been up for a few hours now and really gathering up the data.
|CHALLENGER|Outstanding, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, the name of the game,today is to stay with EVA prep timeline. We're not going to talk much to you, we'd like — except to bug you a little, stay on your back to keep with the timeline if at all possible, we'd like to get out on time, over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo, that's been our motive all along and we will stay with it. As of right now we're now 1 hour behind, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, although if you stay on the normal timeline, that's fine with us. we'don't need to gain any but we just don't want to lose any from where we're starting now.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, understand, understand.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, how are you this morning?
|PAO|Thisis Apollo Control. The reference to Aggie has to do with the fact that the Flight Director, Gold Team Flight Director, Gerry Griffin is an alumnus of Texas A & M University. The wake-up music this morning was the Aggie war hymn, E- P lurib us Gig-Um, and Gerry proceeded to gig the crew with his * own brand of music.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Challenger.
|CHALLENGER|Okay Gordy, crew status is good, in case you hadn't noticed, and again I'm not going to - we haven't kept an itemized accounting of the food, there weren't enough blanks on the paper to do that, but we have ate - have eaten, pardon me, we have eaten just about everything in the various meals. I guess the shrimp was the only thing we'didn't really eat, and we've been drinking a^lot of water and all the juices and tea and stuff, so I think we're in pretty good shape there. The commander had a seconal last night and he slept 3 good, 3 intermittent hours. LMP had no medication and had 6 good hours of sleep. If you've got some lift-off time data, well I'll copy it.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. Okay start with - for rev 38 time is 162:22:52. Rev 39 is 164:21:24. 166:19:55; 168:18:27; 170.16.59; 172:15:31; that should have been rev 43 and readback starting with rev 38.
|CHALLENGER|Okay rev —
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72, 13:40CST, 160:37GET, 634/1
160:37:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, REV 38,1162 22 52, 164 21 24, 166 19 55, 168 18 27, 170 16 59, 172 15 311And what is our present REV?
|CAPCOM|That's a good1question. Let's see here. We're working on Rev 37. Ron just went by about 30 minutes ago on REV 37.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, we're pressing on but if you've got any good word - like news and what have you where we are we'd ap p re ci a te it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, there hasn't been a lot of news but I'll read you what we've got. President - former President Truman is still holding on. His heartbeat, breathing and temperature all became unstable yesterday, but then he improved again. A Methodist minister in Kansas City said he's a rugged guy who's hanging in there and he's going to make it. The headlines were full of reports of the finding of orange dirt and the rest of your adventures yesterday. Internationally the U.S. and North Vietnam held intensified secret peace talks and Henry Kissinger prepared to return to Washington probably this afternoon, I understand, after a final session with Le Due Tho. French press had a compromise within the works on the withdrawal of North Vietnamese Troops from the South. The Houston Rockets lost to Buffalo up in Buffalo last night. But the hockey team the Arrows took a 6 to 4 win over the Alberta Oilers. In - really that's about it on the news except inaybe from the weather which finally broke. The cold front cleared out the drizzly rain last night and for the first time since you've launched - that I can remember any way - we've been able to look up and see the Moon directly. It's a pretty site as always. That's not much of a report but that's about all we have. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, thank you. What's the date today?
|CAPCOM|It's Wednesday the 13th of December.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Right now it's about 1:35 in the afternoon.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, just take a quick peek up there - I can't really see too much of North American Continent - South American Continent looks pretty good and it might be my eyeballs rather than the clouds up there but it looks like most of the clouds are up into the north central part of the southwestern or southeastern United States.
|CAPCOM|I have a satellite picture here and that's about the way it looks.
|CHALLENGER|Well, it's sunny and pleasant on the Valley of Taurus Littrow. And, Gordo, what is our Sun angle going out t oday ?
|CAPCOM|I'll get you an answer on that. Couple of questions. First of all, the surgeon would like a Biomed rake and they were wondering how your hands feel this morning?
|CHALLENGER|Hands are in good shape, Gordo. No problem.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 160:37 CST 13:40 MC634/2
160:37:00|CAPCOM|Okay, that sounds good. Sun is getting up there about 33 degrees now.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'll go a mild midleft and both PLSS's have been topped off.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, the LMP isn't hooked up right now. He will be shortly. So stand by on the Biomed.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Okay, I have a few words on the Command Module trajectory that might be of interest, although it doesn't affect your procedures any.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 13:40 CST 160:47 GET MC-635/1
160:47:00|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the command module orbit somehow is missing all the mascons and not degrading into circular like we thought it would, it's just staying where it was about 70 by 50, and so what we're planning on is an extra little maneuver about 1 hour prior to the normal plane change which will lower the command module altitude and the plane change mode to 60. This will be about 11 feet per second RCS burn, and then Ron will do the plane change at the normal time but it'll be little bigger than that we had planned, I think the last half was about 365 feet per second, for plane change and we checked the consumables that puts the RCS right on preflight line, he's been running about 4 or 5 percent above it. That will use up that pad there put him back to nor - nominal on RCS and on the FDS puts you right down on the CSM rescue redline. So, really no problem, in good shape, consumable-wise. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Sounds like a good rendezvous posture,

161:14:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston have you got any updates to the EVA cuff check list?
|CAPCOM|No, I don't think there is, Jack, although I do have a write in for the lunar surface checklist. And one that you really don't need to write in on the prep card. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, page 5-10 on the lunar surface checklist. Reason for this change is to prevent cabin pressure from increasing. It got up to 5.7 yesterday. And it will also prevent water sep spindown like happened yesterday, if you happen to have the return hose blocked against the wall outlet there. The change is to write in in the upper left corner 5-10, just prior to suit iso actuator override, suit disconnect. Write in pressure REGS A and B to egress. And then down 5 lines where it says cabin gas return egress change it to cabin gas return auto. Verify. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy, at the top of the page, REGS A and B to EGRESS and then 5 lines down cabin gas return auto verify.
|CAPCOM|That's right and the only other change I have is - has to do with matching - just like yesterday matching the purge valve to the OPS's and maximize the OPS capability and we can just call you when you get to that point - it's - or if you want to write it down - you need 211 and Geno needs 208.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we've got that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's all.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy I guess we play the cuff checklist just as planned, with the exception of the bag numbers which have changed, the collection bag numbers. I have more or less repaired the sample bag holder on my camera. It's taped on there pretty well with good tape, believe it or -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 14:17 CST 161:24 GET 638/1
161:24:00|SCHMITT|(garbled) off the (garbled) bag. I don't know that we have any other outstanding hardware problem. I think in terms of sampling Gene and I will try to shift the emphasis in the mantle area to fragments that are different from the gabbros that we've sampled fairly well I think up to now that presumably subfloor materials. You might pass that word on and see if they agree with it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we copy that. And Jack, if you are at a convenient place, sit and listen while you're doing some of your stuff. Let me read up some of the planning for EVA 3 and the summary of what we think we have so far.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I'll read here from this thing just verbatim. Says: EVA 3 continues to follow essentially the nominal premission plan. Main objective continues to be the North Massif, Station 6, 7, Sculptured Hills and Van Serg Crater. Due to extensive observations of the dark mantle and plain subfloor unit on EVA 1 and 2 particularly at report Station 5. The relatively, the relative part at Station 10 is reduced, so Station 10 becomes a flexible station as time allotment is a reserve, possible providing more time at the early station if desired. However, mantle and block sampling at Station 10 are important objectives. Luch, pack, and strength are not nearly as tight as they were yesterday guys, and so we can be more flexible and reshuffle station time as we need. It probably won't be coming up again spots and want (garbled) like we'did at Station 4. Close-out time at the LM has been increased by 20 minutes to make the closeout less rushed and to allow for potential ALSEP trouble shooting. It is currently planned to take this time from Station 67. But if 67 requires more time when we get there we can borrow from one of the other stations. I guess the particular Station 10 probably. As the initial activity we going to take explosive package 5 with us and stick it under the LMP seat and I'll remind you in real time when we get down on the ground on that one. And No. 5 precount over the deploy at Station 10 and again I'll remind you about that in real time so don't start to bother to right it in on your checklist. Plan traverse to proceed as normal. We're expecting to spend about an hour and 20 minutes at Station 6 and 7 and the suggestion is that we may end up wanting to spend that totally at the split boulder division 6, but of course the option still exists to visit more than one place and sample of the boulders if it seems feasible and attractive and desirable. They are suggesting additional 500 mm photographs e xpe ci ally if it seems we can use those as document tracks and sources of documenting the sample boulder. Perferably Station 6 and 7. We are continuing to hold the nominal 47 minutes at Station 8, there's 8A and we still that's as good as place as any to sample the Sculptured Hills. Station 9 still nominal 30 minutes, but in view of the similarities therein to Station 4 we are anticipating a possible desireable to remove time from Station 10 to enlarge Station 9, but that will have to be a real time decision based on what we find at Station 9. Station 47 - Station 10 continues nominal. We're still interested in sampling the blocks and also interested in trenching the (garbled) so that we can say something about the dark mantle, light area relationship. And perhaps the nominal coring. We are going to employ EP5 there and other than that they're basically the same. If we have the time during that close-out and you'll know we have enlarged the close-out somewhat of the LM based on our experience the last two nights, particularly for dusting, but also, if time permits in that time we might try and get the - use up the extra double core, if there is one, in a dark mound near (garbled) trenching near the LM. But that's only if time permits at the very end before the consumables run out. They want to call attention to two particular things here. One; since you guys really haven't gotten any very big rocks so far, they are recommending they say here and I quote: "The value of large individual samples have been demonstrating. We recommend that several football size samples of a uniform igneous rock be collected at Station 9 or 10. I'll pass that on as that and another point of interest is the one — wanted 20 mm size section of the regolith, the dark mantle, the pathology than any observations or collections you can make pertinent to that. It will be of interest in trying to determine the relationship of the dark mantle, the subfloor you see gabbro underneath. Two short questions which I'll ask which I hope you can answer in just a very few words. One of them is a yes and no answer. 1 One, we - they can't find the geophone photos, they're going to be called out in the transcript. There is probably a little bit of garble at that point and the back room will be very happy if you could say once and for all, Jack, that yes you did get the geophone photos. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 14:17 CST 161:24 GET 638/2
161:24:00|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And the second one concerns the quarter pound charges deployed on the way in last night. Two questions on that* It appears to us from your voice transcript that we weren't fast enough on it at the time that that may be deployed closer to the ALSEP than the one you deployed on the way out and we'd like your impression on that and No. 2, you mentioned that you placed it in the depressions, you had some feeling about the depression in terms of how much of a danger that bomb - charge might place to the ALSEP when it goes off. If the depression is any sort they're probably pretty well protecting the ALSEP. Any comment on those two questions. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 14:17 CST 161:24 GET 638/3
161:24:00|SCHMITT|Well, the second one is not in a major depression. But it is a, maybe a - little ditch, maybe a third of a meter deep. I imagine it will help a little bit. That's why we picked it. Just a second.
|CERNAN| q uestion.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we have a feeling that when you
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger, but there's again some confusion on that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yeah, and those mileages also seem to indicate that we had the call out, remember you drove back by and said you say the flag and then you said you actually saw the charge itself first. And itwas some time after that you think you deployed the charge. We have the opinion from both that and the mileage you probably deployed the second charge closer to the ALSEP than the first one. Do you have any further feel for that?
|CERNAN| when I did a big 360 and Jack was out of film and I just lined up to take that picture with him up in the background. And when I said hey, I saw the charge first. I was really don't take that comment to strong.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| I - we're looking for 'em out there now. As a matter of fact we can't see 'em from here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll let it go at that. And that's all the questions and comments we have on todays traverse. We'll have a few real time things on the surface which I won't bother you with. A possible fix to the thrust electrical properties and a possible trip back to the surface perimeter which is still having it's problems. But I'll talk with you guys in real time on those when you get on the surface rather than bothering you with them now.
|CERNAN| charge be from the ALSEP?
|CAPCOM|They want it about 3 00 to 40 0 meters.
|CAPCOM|And Gene, you got 0.2 for range.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Coming back to the LM. And I guess the question would be: Did you every go through zero on the way back to the LM? If you are at 0.2, we think 092 was the bearing, then the LM is right where we thought it was and we were just a little confused by our distances. They don't quite hold together.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 14:17 CST 161:24 GET 638/4
161:24:00|SCHMITT|Naw, I don't think I ever went through zero because I initiated that myself.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|We copy that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll work on that.
|CERNAN| to think about. It's not that far out there. You know if there is any question about that damaging the ALSEP it -
|SCHMITT|It's just hard for us to recall how close they were. And we sort of thought you had them pin pointed for us. But if you want it 3 to 400 meters, you might think about a late -
|CAPCOM|No. We thought about that. we'don't want to do that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|No, we'don't want to do that so we'll take care of it. Don't worry about it now. That's all we have. Press on with the (garbled)
|SCHMITT|Bob, I can -
|SCHMITT|Hey, Bob, this is Jack, I can see the charge with the binocular. It's out almost behind a rock between us and the LM, but 1 can see it. I mean a rock between it and the LM. I can't give you any idea though how far it is.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Know it's the one off the left.
|CERNAN| Hey, Bob, let me say again. I think we ought to emphasis the exotic looking fragments on the dark mantle and we ought to try to make sure that we look at a variety of rocks from the North Massif. I think we saw the major rock types on the South Massif yesterday, but we really didn't spend a lot of time ranging along the front there to verify that completely. The other comment on the 1 to 20 mm size fracture - there isn't an awful lot of that in the dark mantle. That's one of the striking tec---

161:35:00|CHALLENGER|We're going to spend a lot time ranging along the front there to verify that completely. The other comment on the 1 to 20 millimeter size fraction, there isn't an awful lot of that in the Dark Mantle. That's one of the striking things about it. It's, in that size range, there just isn't very much, except chips of what appear to be comparable albedo anyway of the subfloor gabbro. We'll keep our eyes on it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that. And we'll talk, I'll talk with the back room about stations 6 and 7. We'll get with you on that when you get there. And press on.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger. I was Biomed right there for about 10 minutes, in case you're curious.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and it looked good.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Bob, I've got them both, and the last one we'deployed which I think was the eastern one, the eastern most one, is definitely farther out than the first one we'deployed. And this distance is awful hard by looking at Jack's geophones. I got to give you at least 300 meters, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. Bob's in the back room. I'm sure they're listening and we got that.
|CHALLENGER|Yes. I've got both of them with the binoculars now and the second one, the last one we'deployed is quite a bit farther out than the first one.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I think that's what they want to hear.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, I guess it's half again or maybe even twice as far away as the, as the first we'deployed. So, we're going to forget it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. That sounds good.
|CHALLENGER|And, Gordo, I'm going off the air also here for about 10 minutes. It'll speed things up a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Fine.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 161 hours 44 minutes. We're i hour behind the Challenger timeline in the Flight Plan. Barring further delays, we would anticipate the start of EVA at 163 hours 40 minutes or 4:33 PM, Central Standard Time. I

|CHALLENGER|Okay. LMP's water is open. You got yours.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I got mine. Excuse me.
|CHALLENGER|Well, let's see.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you got it open so I need to turn around. See if I can back1in and out of the way of the door.
|CHALLENGER|Say, Bob, what do you see in REG A?
|CAPCOM|Standby Gene, we're seeing high suit pressures, s tand by.
|CHALLENGER|How's suit p re s s ure .
|CAPCOM|Okay, and about your -
|CAPCOM|Gene, you're go to go out and once you get out maybe Jack can turn around and work on those a bit better. We're seeing I guess the suit looks a little high in pressure. *
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'm looking at - at about 47 on the suit loop right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|There you go.
|CHALLENGER|(garbled) Okay, turn.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control the reference is to the suit loop in the Lunar Module - not to the pressure suits themselves .

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|they need to go to your left a little to clear the pruse. And your harness. There we go.
|CERNAN| cards -
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I saw that Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|GARBLE. Can you come forward just a little. That clip got away. Come towards me, in the cabin - there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Wait a minute. Okay. I got it.
|SCHMITT|Hey you're in good shape.
|CERNAN| Okay, I'm on the porch, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, what do you want? What can I do for you, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Standby Jack we'll get a word to you in one minute.
|CERNAN| Get my LE C ready for you.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm in the most normal OMNI right now.
|SCHMITT|Going to pressure down a little bit.
|CERNAN| I can't get to.
|SCHMITT|I'll give you the JETT bag any way, Geno, while they're thinking. I guess that's part of RD. Oh, yes, the JETTbag, Santa Clauses bag again. Yeah, exactly -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack we'd like to have you stand just a minute or so longer we're trying to keep track here of the suit circuit pressure and see if it is stabilizes or starts to drop. The One REG is just been intermittently leaking - we still haven't isolated it and we think we've got it shut off - but we're still watching it - so bear with us just a minute or so.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I thought you isolated it last night.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| a TGE.
|SCHMITT|Okay, got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack and how about taking the suit circuit release valve cycle adjust to open and then back to aut o.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, stand by. Suit circuit release going open in auto. That's done.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll watch it here for a minute and let you know.

|CERNAN| could be better to leave it up. Beautiful out here today, Bob, we can look to the east for a change a little bit, anyway.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that Gene.
|CERNAN| the crew battery changee out.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and as you walk by there, if you walk by in the right spot the rover how about giving us a set temperature read out, please.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy, 103.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| little baby now. Supposed to be simple. Bob, we have no use for the old battery, right?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|CERNAN| closed. Oh, don't that step into that.
|SCHMITT|Are you talking to me or you?
|CERNAN| familiar and looks familiar. The old plain. And there lays Taurus Littrow.
|SCHMITT|You want to get your antenna?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll come over there.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll draw it out - I'll step it out for you. You can measure it.
|CERNAN| gloves off? I mean my cover gloves.
|CERNAN| see where we're going. See what the boulder field looks like up the re.
|SCHMITT|Well, I know what it's going to look like . C E RN AN1N o you d on 1 t .
|SCHMITT|the point is my hands will be much better off without them.
|CERNAN| are closed in tight. High gain is already oriented. Oh, they ve even got TV I guess.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|CAPCOM|But, Geneo when you push the Rover circuit breakers in how about giving us a battery temperature reading on the rover bat.
|CERNAN| if I can16
|SCHMITT|Well, let me see if I can do something else while I m waiting.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll get the old set receiver.
|CERNAN| and battery two is reading zero. So, we got a gauge failure. No, it s not reading zero it's off scale low.
|CAPCOM|Okay, read that - copy that. That's a real cool then isn't it? Okay, Jack if your going to worry about the sep stand by and don't do the sep until after you worry with the ETB and we'll get to you on that. When you get the ETB to the seat -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| can keep it1on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, a couple of things on that Geneo. You might try tapping the thing to see if that loosens the dust. There's also the hook business on the inside of the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/73 CST 16:35 GET 163:43 652/3
163:43:00|CAPCOM|pallet that you could hook it on. Caution, if you open the pallet be careful not to knock the clamps off the fender. But, you can also reach over the pallet to put the big bag on.
|CERNAN| yesterday. I'm not sure we're going to have much luck with them .
|CAPCOM|Say again there, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. You might want to put the big bag on the inside of the pallet if you can't operate them.
|CERNAN| Is that corre ct?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I've got Mary and Frannie and Nancy and Donna and Bobby -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And Karen.
|CERNAN| front end. We'll find a place for that in there. It's too hard to get off the front end. Okay, let's see big bag to gate dust brush too. Let me get that big bag on the insdie of the gate if I can. Inside the gate or the pallet, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Inside the pallet, my fault there.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 16:45 CST 163:52 GET 653/1
163:52:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Inside of the pallet. My (garbled)
|SCHMITT|that - that's the pallet, the pallet -
|CAPCOM|And if you open the pallet, be careful of the clamp. It probably is feasible we suggest you reach across in front of the pallet. Reach across the pallet to do it. Instead of to open it because of the clamp on the f en de r .
|SCHMITT|It is not feasible. It's not feasible to do that. I got to open it plus our hook is over center Let me get something to work on that with.
|CERNAN| hook can be out of the little C-shaped release in there? It is.
|CAPCOM|Oh, Boy.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Jack, when you get done with the ETB then you might save the gray tape out and use a little bit of that on the set. When you get done.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|We'll turn the -
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|We'll turn both switches ON when you're out at the set transmitter.
|SCHMITT|Well, the tape is in the CDR' s seat and it'll still be there.
|CAPCOM|No, we'd like to take the tape from the CDR's seat and use it on the staff right now.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|You want me to do it or Gene to do it?
|SCHMITT|Why don't you do it since the tape is the re.
|CAPCOM|No, let's let Gene do it. Doesn't really matter. Whoever wants to.
|SCHMITT|Okay, we'll get it.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, the big bag is on the inside of the - of the pallet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SCHMITT|I want it closed.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And I know why.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Get rid of this thing. we'don't need it anyway.
|SCHMITT|Okay, opening and closing of the pallets didn't interfer at all with those fenders.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 16:45 CST 163:52 GET 653/2
163:52:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Now the tape - The big bag is on the inside th o ugh.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got it.
|CERNAN| Don't close it.
|SCHMITT|Did I get it out of the way?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You dragged over that locking device.
|CERNAN| h e re .
|SCHMITT|Okay. Big bag. Dust brush. SCB to gate mount 20 bag dispenser on the Commander's camera, 20 bag dispenser to the LMP, core cap dispensor to the gate.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And Jack, are you going up to take the pan now?
|SCHMITT|Well, as soon as I finish up here.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I'll do that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and after you take the pan, we'd like you to change the cosmic ray experiment. They're expecting a little solar storm and before the rain gets on the cosmic ray experment, they'd like to retrieve it. We'll leave it in the ETB during the traverse.
|SCHMITT|Okay, after the pan. Alright.
|CAPCOM|Roger. It will just be a nominal retrieval and we'll put it in the ETB. Copy the gate.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|OkaySCB. (garbled)
|CERNAN| back. Short can under the LMP seat.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| some of these bags on your camera while I'm here.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene, if you got time there with the camera why don't we — when you get done with the camera, how about getting some gray tape and we'll put you to work on SEP for a minute.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, did you get Jack's camera fixed last night? I didn't hear?
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 16:45 CST 163:52 GET 653/3
163:52:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Do that one there/
|CERNAN| commander s camera, Will do it when I get back. 20 bag dispenser on the LMP1 s camera core cap to gate one there, there's one under the seat short cans under the LMP ' s seat. Okay I got to put that cap dispenser on him, I got to get my rammer hammer,
|SCHMITT|Hey, Bob, what bag do you want on the LMP ?
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Standby. I think 8 went in either 4 or 6. No excuse me either 5 or 4.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| back. What do you want? Or let me give you CB readings and get that out of. the way and then I'll work on your SEP.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| 6 70 02 7 001.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that, Gene. Thank you.
|SCHMITT|fender wrinkled up in the Sun a little b it last night.
|CERNAN| ated.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|And Bob, I took two 5 foot stereo pairs of the configuration.
|CAPCOM|Co py .
|SCHMITT|And we'll stick it in the ETB and just le ave it th e re.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| you don't confuse it with the rock. It is in bag 106.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, take some gray tape over to the receiver, Gene. And with reference to the fact that there is some Velcro missing on the front there which hold the covers down, we'd like to tape the two covers together - in the middle there - you know where the two sides overlap in the middle of the box. Tape those two together. A short piece about an inch long should do it if they are clean.
|CERNAN| because of the dust, but I might be able to go over it with one piece to clean it and another piece to yape it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And the question beyond that, Is there velcro to hold one of those flaps down or not?
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 16:55 GET 164:02 MC654/1
164:02:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, both pieces of Velcro missing from both flaps, I take it.
|CERNAN| tape that held the lower Velcro on there apparently came loose, and it stuck to the upper Velcro.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I understand that. In that case, we'd like to take a piece of tape and tape the cover down to keep it closed when it's not — when it's supposed to be closed. The feeling is that if the cover flaps partly open you may get specular reflection off the inside of the Mylar down on to the mirrors causing it to heat up during the drive when it's supposed to be closed.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CAPCOM|And, Jack, if you're done, you might go rescue EP number 5 from the footpad, and we'll put it under the LMP ' s seat.
|SCHMITT|Well, be a lot of other things under there. Okay. I'11 rescue it, and we'll see where the best place to put it is.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Hey, I got — I got bags on you. I got bags on your camera, Geno.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| on the rear there, on our PLSS's?
|CAPCOM|One of them will go —
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|— those two on — or one on the LMP seat will go on the CDR, the one with aLl the stuff in it.
|CERNAN| Jack. We'll put either one of those —
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|So, I can't put the charge under my seat.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, I think, Jack, once you1j get SCB-7 out of there1:
|SCHMITT|Yep. I feel like a kid stuck to taffy.
|CERNAN| grained rocks out here. Seen a couple, but certainly not very many.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What are you doing up there? Okay.
|CERNAN| solves the problem.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and so does Dr. Strangelove.
|PAO|The storm reference is a minor solar flare which represents no danger to the crew, but could affect the very sensitive cosmic ray experiment.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 16:55 GET 164:02 MC654/2
164:02:00|CERNAN| like we would like to see it solved. Bob, — nothing,
|SCHMITT|Gene, your bag's going to have two lowers an d one upper,
|CAPCOM|Did you re-sort things there, Jack?
|SCHMITT|What's that?
|CAPCOM|Did you re-sort things in SCB-7? I was —
|SCHMITT|I said I got — Bob, I just — Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Our understanding was there are two uppers and one lower in Bag 7, and two lowers under the LMP seat. Did you re-sort things there?
|SCHMITT|Do you want — how do you want them?
|CAPCOM|Doesn5 t matter to us.. I just wanted to make sure that we know what you are so we'don't let you get away too far with two uppers and a lower.. Two lowers and an upper is certainly better than two uppers and a lower.
|CAPCOM|As long as we know what it is. SCHMITTT1Okay, it's two lowers and an upper.
|CAPCOM|Got that.
|SCHMITT|two lowers and an upper.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. When you're ready, I'll configure you.
|CERNAN| I got -
|SCHMITT|Get it? And, I'm going to ask you to turn 1 — 180 degrees because you're up on a hill.
|CERNAN|

|SCHMITT|Okay, that's done. Okay?
|CERNAN| good cover. Okay?
|CERNAN| Jack .
|CAPCOM|Go ahead. Say again there, Gene. SCB 6? SCB 4, copy.
|CERNAN| I got to get these PLSS straps;, too. Would you get mine?
|SCHMITT|those harness release straps?
|CERNAN| as you go out, then I forgot about them.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| a better time to do them anyway , rather than when we go out.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 16:55 GET 164:02 MC654/3
164:02:00|CERNAN| other one when I configure your other side. Okay, you're on. Okay, want to get my PLSS straps? Then, I'll be cleaned up and, then I finish your other side.
|SCHMITT|Going to get down now?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|(garble) on the hands.
|CERNAN| ge t th i s -
|PAO|EVA time, 36 minutes.
|SCHMITT|Okay, now, come over here, and I'll get you a core cap dispenser, which I left here. Okay, you got SCB 4, you got the cap, you got the rammer, I'll take the hammer. You got the -- that's all you need. TGE is on the LRV.
|CERNAN| got there, J ack?
|SCHMITT|5 is under my seat.
|CERNAN| 3 on the Rover, LCRU blankets are open 100 per cent, battery covers are closed. I want to -- Push that battery cover over there down just to make sure it goes down.
|SCHMITT|the warning flag is up (garble).
|CERNAN| huh? Ye ah.
|SCHMITT|Rover on down there. Rover warning was up .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's down.
|CERNAN| but the gauge on the high battery looked like it may have failed. Okay, LCRU blankets are open, battery covers are closed, and pushed closed on the LCRU.
|SCHMITT|I'm going to the SEP.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And you might want to take a couple ....
|CAPCOM|17, we think somebody lost their COM. Jack probably Gene going to Zero.
|SCHMITT|You read us Bob?
|CAPCOM|Roger. Read you now.
|SCHMITT|Bob, you read Gene.
|CAPCOM|Reading you Jack. I haven't heard Gene yet.
|SCHMITT|Bob, Gene's calling you.
|CAPCOM|You read me.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, read you now.
|CERNAN| my mode switch here. Okay, we got 2 and 3 on the EP ' s plus 100 mag feet. The crew blankets are opened 100 per cent, battery covers are closed, dust brush. I've TGE, I've got mag depolarization filter is taken care of, an d I'm ready to traverse to the S IM.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We understand GD stowed and you're taken care of in the COM. And you might give us a Rover readout either now or when you get to the SIM.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yes. SIM is probably more convenient, while you re sitting there waiting for the NAV's to warm up or initialize. Waiting for us to give you the reading.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Hey, Bob, are you watching LMP?
|CAPCOM|Not anymore. I switched to TV.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. Read you loud and clear. We're now watching the LMP.
|CERNAN| the TV. I just want to make sure we got COM here.
|CAPCOM|Yes. We're reading you in Mode 1.
|CERNAN| gloves off,
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| have dusted my1checklist on the Rover. I can't read down there.
|SCHMITT|Bob, the old date fix on the SEP's still working.
|CAPCOM|Beautiful.
|SCHMITT|there's a little, both mirrors have a little angular displacement, but not more than 5 degrees.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|45 Yankee is sample from near the SEP.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, well. I got the sample anyway.
|CAPCOM|We copied 45 Yankee near the SEP. That's all x-7 e have. You give us a frame count when you get done, and give us an approximate location to the Rover, at least crosswise from the Y, we'd appreciate it. And we also need SEP receiver power and DSEA both on. And we'd like to cover tape deck (garble) when you get done, Jack.

|SCHMITT|Head towards it and then make your turn.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|As a matter of fact, turn on these tracks.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, that 45 Yankee was a fine grain basalt, I think. One of the few around here. That's why I picked it up.

|CERNAN| I - we're passed the end of the antenna and we're headed south or n ortheast.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I - did you give me a mark when you started or a mark when you passed the antenna?
|CERNAN| about 20 seconds to get to the end.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| go back?
|CAPCOM|No. No. Press on. And Jack if you look at your contour map there we think you are located right now at approximately where the P in SEP is, just below the P in Poppy ) in which case you're probably driving through that little crater that's just to the northeast there. That's probably the one you came upon.
|CERNAN|
|PAO|Distance to station 6 is 3.3 kilometers.
|SCHMITT|See a little bit better.
|PAO|Estimated driving time 20 minutes.
|CERNAN| gabbro. Surface texture has not changed. There is a granule population now that I look at it more closely, with the shadows. But I have a feeling that most of those are - they look like they're just small - very small clods. That should show up in some of the bulk samples we've taken. It is remarkable to me the - all the small number of fine grain rocks. There's one at about halfway between the SEP and the LM that I'd like to pick up, it's a fairly good sized one. Maybe we can get it when we get back. It looks like a fine grained basalt. I may have sampled one in 45 Yankee there.
|SCHMITT|I tell you it's not exactly the greatest place to navigate through.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. That's where I'm going here. I just want to get cross this mounted boulders.
|CERNAN| passing 207.4 about 20 meters in diameter with the pyroxene gabbro blocks on the rim, few of them. It's not an exceptionally blocky rim crater but we are in an area where the block population is up to about 5 percent in contrast to most of the area we traversed yesterday. I tell you going is a little bit rough Population of block Jack, there is an awful lot of small craters.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I was just going to add that the fre quency of craters in the ten meters side range is quite a bit higher than we were used to yesterday.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72, 17:14CST, 164:20GET, 656/3

|SCHMITT|Bob, you said 185 1.5?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|SCHMITT|What do you want?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, they changed it on us. Okay. Okay - there's - still seeing the little pit bottom craters with the glass in them. I've forgotten the acronym all ready, Bob, I'm sorry, and you asked me for a LMP frame count a while back and I believe it was 5. That was at the SEP.
|CAPCOM|That was after the SEP photos, right?
|SCHMITT|that's affirm.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| we see these scattered strewn field of boulders that generally seen to start from a - more or less from a line of large boulders which might indicate some structure and those lines are roughly horizontal across the face that we're looking at. The boulder tracks are irregular in shape, obviously down hill but you'll see in the pictures that they - that they are curved in places but they all - that I see - tend to be aggregates of little craters where the boulder was obviously tumbling, and bouncing a little bit. They're out in population of fragments now in the immediate area at - is that 188.
|SCHMITT|188 0.9.
|CERNAN| craters. But at the crater rim it's up to about 5 percent.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that Jack.
|CAPCOM|How far down the North Massif is the line of boulders?
|CERNAN| I'm talking about is about 100 meter long lines where the boulder trains initiate and there's one about - looks like about half way - maybe two thirds of the way down in perspective, another one that's probably about half way - they're just sort of scattered around on the Massif.

|SCHMITT|Where are you looking.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes our heading the (garble) down here is really should put up to west of Jones. So that's ab o ut ri ght.
|SCHMITT|A lot of static in the background today.
|CAPCOM|Yes, I think we are talking to you guys through the LM right now and how about a speed reading.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|187 1.1.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| that structure in there, but I think those lines of boulder sources are about all we can see right now. Talked about the lineaments yesterday and their not ne axly as obvious today in the higher sun. Looking up Wessex Cleft - even with the sun in the flat area it looks darker than the north massif side, but again the sun angle may be fooling us but I recall it was darker on the photos. The old man wrinkled face on the -
|SCHMITT|Sculptured Hills.
|CERNAN| soon as you come out of the Wessex Cleft.
|SCHMITT|Yes, and it looks like there are boulders up on the side of Sculptured Hills except that they aren't nearly as big as those on the north massif. The areas where the boulder sources look like their made up of boulders no bigger than a meter maybe whereas the north massif boulders are up to several meters. Those boulder sources all seem to be up within a third of the height of the Sculptured Hills just south - just east of the Massif -- of the Wessex Cleft. There is a boulder track that crossed the slope. See that Geno?
|CERNAN| goes rather than perpendicular contours it's probably crossing .1them in a fairly straight line on an angle of 60 degrees may b e. Back to the east.
|CERNAN| fairly near. Jack see this big boulder with the big track it looks like it's on an elongated rolled up boulder look at th at.
|SCHMITT|Looks like it maybe broken now.

|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob I'd like a bearing and range.
|CAPCOM|Okay, bearing and range for the large block just beyond let's see it's just beyond the crater Henry that large block there near the blaker slope which is our next aiming point. The bearing and range there is 188 an d 2.8.
|SCHMITT|188 and 2.8, roger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack do you - what do you see in the way of boulders coming down the base of the Sculptured Hills in terms of sampling opportunities of station 8 and in terms of boulder tracks that we might lead down to boulders that might just possibly be accessible of station 8.
|SCHMITT|Watch this, Gene. Boulder tracks are not obvious on Sculptured Hills at all. It looks like their are fragments over there that would have their sources higher up the slope. I think we can get boulders there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|We'll have to get a little closer, Bob.
|CAPCOM|We'll find out in a couple of hours.
|SCHMITT|Yes, I will give you a reading on that before long. I wouldn't eliminate station 8 for the world or the Moon whatever's available today.

|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| but I tell you we still got static.
|SCHMITT|I don't have any, Gene. You may -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, you've got yourself In some holes here. I read you all along though so there is no problem. Okay, there's a big crater. I haven't recognized Jones yet. Looks like your getting up on the rim of Henry here.
|CERNAN| be well west of Henry I think. I wouldn't be surprised if Henry isn't right over that little rise on the right. Bob, the surface structure hasn't changed texture we're on a little bit of a rise in here now and still about one percent of the s urf ace.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|there's Henry.
|CAPCOM|Okay, how about a range and bearing.

|SCHMITT|Yes, 188 1.8.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|On the rim. Oh, Prince Henry the navigator. Watch that foot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|And Henry looks much like Horatio did. Has boulders on it's inner wall. Not as many, they looked light colored a light albedo or gabbroic appearance. There maybe some right down there though that are fine grain they look a little grayer.
|CERNAN| that's one right down there. See the one we've got over tlirrf has a boulder track. That's the one that cross slope and if we could get -
|SCHMITT|We' 11 see.
|CERNAN| turning boulder.
|SCHMITT|Yes that's it.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 17:24 GET 164:30 657/4
164:30:00|SCHMITT|I think we can it doesn't look too bad.

|CAPCOM|Okay, we hope that's fairly obvious.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 17:32 CST 164:39 GET 658/1
164:39:00|SCHMITT|As I was saying. Henry just looks like somewhat more mantled Horatio., (Laughs)
|CAPCOM|Getting to be rediculous.
|CERNAN| now to get around the western rim of Henry.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|And on the west rim we got about 10 percent bo ulde r cover.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and a reminder Jack to keep taking your Rover photos.
|SCHMITT|Yes, sirrrrr. And when I - by boulder I generally mean fragments, Bob, in this case. When I say 10 percent, I'm looking at stuff greater than about a centimeter in diameter.
|SCHMITT|I'll try to say fragments from now on and be more precise. Okay, here's a little area where there's -
|CERNAN| rim of Henry I see, that has fairly large fragments or boulders on 'em up to 2 or 3 meters. But again they all appear to be buried. There are very few except small ones sitting out on the surface.
|SCHMITT|And you know the fragment population out here only goes out to maybe 200 meters, I expect.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Now this concentration of boulders is because of a 50 meter crater in the rim of Henry.
|CAPCOM|Say that sounds like a lot ---
|SCHMITT|I think that was one that we -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No. As far as I can see -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, that's - Locke is right ahead of us .
|SCHMITT|this is one on the - about 50 meters right on the rim crest of Henry. Almost due - west rim, due west rim. Now Locke is just ahead of us. It also has boulders in it's walls. But has relatively few on the rim.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Characteristics of both Henry, Locke and Horatio is a - simply no change to the average frequency boulders on the rim. The increase comes in the wall.
|CERNAN| between Henry and Locke.
|SCHMITT|Locke
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay. I copy that. And you guys are heading for that big boulder which must be just dead ahead of you there about half a kilometer.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 17:32 CST 164:39 GET 658/2
164:39:00|SCHMITT|Well, we - Gene's sort of headed for Station 6 now.
|CERNAN| boulder and get a case on it.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that would be a good mark to give us a range and bearing on. That's a pretty good straight point.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, the boulder concentrations in the wall of Henry have their up slope start at about, oh, I would guess average of 30 meters down from the rim crest. The rim crest of Henry is not very well defined, but it s there. And they - from that initiation of boulders they stream down the slope to the breaketts and slope down at the floor. Still no obvious change in the dark mantle as we're just to the east of Locke now. There's some - there's a 30 meter crater, fairly subdued but still quite deep. (garbled) Again it looks as if it were mantled. That - has no significant increase in blocks on it's rim. That crater in any ^ other place would have been a very blocky rim crater — it s maybe 30 meters by 5 meters deep. Man that is a big rock up there. Turning Point Rock is a split rock, has a - looks like a northwest southeast overhang with another block just this side of it. Just to the south of that overhang. It's pyramid shape in cross section, triangular shape in crosssection. And it looks like it is pretty well fractured although not pervasively like the rock in Shorty was.
|CERNAN| Station 6.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Now, Bob, Station 6 rod, one of them, is from that boulder track that runs completely across the c on tour.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. Sounds like good news.
|SCHMITT|And there's - the pictures ought to pin down its - at1least the end of the boulder track pretty well.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Whewwwwwww.
|SCHMITT|As I recall - as I saw It the boulder tracks stopped about half way up the slope of the North Mass i f.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| looks like it's -I don't know if it's mantle on top, but it's certainly filleted. there's a lot of the dark mantle up and on the shallower slopes of the boulder, and it's on a little mound itself as if much of it might be covered up.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 17:32 CST 164:39 GET 658/3
164:39:00|SCHMITT|Yeah. Okay, it looks like a breccia from here.

|SCHMITT|I guess Turning Point Rock is 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6,-6 me t e r s hi gh anyway. It's a — I'd say it's a very rough sub-rounded rock - by the
|CERNAN|

|SCHMITT|Well, the big thing Is let's get those let's get the boulder and then get -- in that east west split. Bob, I got an undocumented sample from the middle of the boulder track.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. Soil sample?
|SCHMITT|Whew. Soil sample.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 17:53 GET 165:00 MC660/2
165:00:00|SCHMITT|Gene, if you bit them off in there, it's going to be awful hard to find them. That's the problem. Did you pick a spot — a good spot while you were over here?
|CERNAN| SCHMIT1I think we need to get in the light,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me put a sample in your bag.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's bag 534.
|CERNAN| top to bott on.
|SCHMITT|We've got to get a reference sample out of the — the soil.
|CERNAN| picture, too, so we want to get on the — really want to get on the Sun side.
|SCHMITT|Let me get that slab right there, though, to s t art with.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, there's no -- let's go over on the Sun side because we can't really photograph it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let's go through the splits.
|CERNAN| don't we sample the splits first so we'don't —
|SCHMITT|Look at that overhang — man, I tell you, you get your shovel down there, you'd have a ball.
|CERNAN| that we'don't get it too messed up. And, we can sample some of this stuff.
|SCHMITT|Not — we want this overhang over here, Geno, the north facing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Woops. Don't shuffle too much dirt in th e re .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Not quite. Don't think I can make it. Without hitting you, I can't.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Let me set the gnomon down —
|CERNAN| there. Right. Whoa. Right there. That's good. There's still some good clean ground there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 17:53 GET 165:06 MC660/3
165:06:00|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I get back far enough to take these pic tures. I want to go get a stereo pan around the corner anyway. Let's see if I can't start here with about 56. I'm so close. Gee, I'll get a —
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll get it. Let me — I want to go around the cor — I got it now.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|All set.
|CERNAN| erial. It's in bag 312, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Copy 312.
|CERNAN| where I got it. It's about a half a meter back of the limit of the overhang. (Garble) Put it down, put it down.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I will in a minute.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| overhang will be next.
|SCHMITT|Okay, go get it.
|CERNAN| centimeters, bag 313.
|CAPCOM|Copy, 313.
|CERNAN| from 2 centimeters down to about 8.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| the boulder just to the south of us has some inclusions in it — light colored inclusions.
|SCHMITT|Bag 472 on that.
|CAPCOM|Copy 472 on that. You mean the south half of the split boulder?
|CERNAN| other half. Okay? Okay, now we need boulder stuff. You happy with that, Houston?
|SCHMITT|Let's get (garble).
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we're happy with that (garble).
|SCHMITT|It's a little hard, huh?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Let me get an after picture down in this hole.
|CERNAN| on the — I forgot the after, too.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 17:53 GET 165:00 MC660/4
165:00:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, so that's been spalled off.
|CERNAN| like somebody's been chipping up there. Looks like there's been a geologist here before us.
|SCHMITT|Let me get the gnomon. I think I can get some of these pieces over here. I want to get that-90-degree angular flight line around this boulder, too.
|CERNAN| Here's the piece that fell off. Here's the piece that was knocked off up there.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN| piece of that home — that's obvious, it's obvious —
|SCHMITT|How about this one up here? Take your picture. I think we can just flip that off.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll get a locator from here. Okay.
|CERNAN| f re ezin g.
|SCHMITT|You may be downsun if you do.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Get it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's broken, but it's in place.
|CERNAN| about the size of a —
|SCHMITT|Don't you put it in mine. I can't (garble).
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Got it?
|CERNAN| big spall lying on the ground here that has been knocked off up there from right on top of the boulder. And, I tell you, the more I look at the south half of this boulder, the more heterogeneous in texture it looks. It looks as if it may be either a re crystallized breccia of some kind or you had gabroic anorthosite magma catch up an awful lot of inclusions. I guess I prefer the latter explanation.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 18:04 GET 165:11 661/1
165:11:00|SCHMITT|Because of the extreme vesicularity of the rock.
|CAPCOM|Okay, very interesting.
|CERNAN| are - well their all subrounded around it and a few of them are very light colored. I'm going to try -
|SCHMITT|I'm coming around the corner with a black and white still.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, you know I ought to get one shot back here with a black and white.
|SCHMITT|I'll get this half black and white,
|CERNAN| to pick up a piece of that spall there by the gnomon - I can break it off. There is one right by the gnoman we can just pick up. It's a finer grained vesicular rock, (garb;e) I thought I was going to get this half.
|CERNAN| Jack .
|SCHMITT|Well, they like to have some of them in black and white you know.
|CERNAN| at the objective of this station. I hope we're meeting them -
|SCHMITT|Well, we want to get 500 for that boulder track. I know I want to get that. Okay, a piece of that spall rock was sitting by the gnoman - watch out gnoman,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Is in bag 535.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that one, Jack.
|CERNAN| be able to reach my bag -
|SCHMITT|No, you can put it in mine. Can you reach i t ?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob one of the light colored in clusions looks like it may be an gabbroic anorthisite - let me get my terms straight. The hose rock has dark enough (garbled) pit that it's probably anorthasitic gabbro if I didn't say that. Some of these light colored inclusions have slightly lighter colored glass and they may be the gabbroic an or th as it e .
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that, Jack.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Some of those inclusions get to be bigger than the size of a baseball. There's one here and a couple up there.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 18:04 GET 165:11 661/2
165:11:00|CERNAN| right on the end, right there. Right.
|SCHMITT|Yep, that's a hard rock - yes that's a hard rock. You might be able to do it I can't. I can1t get down the re.
|CERNAN| shadow here.
|SCHMITT|Yes, how about over where your bag went. Let's move around here - I think there is some oops. Get on this slope over here. Okay. How about out over here are we suppose to get - where are we here.
|CERNAN| face uphill your camera faces down.
|SCHMITT|We want go get a rake on the rim of that little crater down there I guess.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17 roger you asking about objective of course the primary objective is documented samples of the blocks and then also we'd like to get some of the rake and soil sample out in the surface namely the rim crater there if that's available. And one of the things of course that we are looking for is a variety of rocks here more than just the one boulder. You can sample the boulder for a while, but we would be interested in seeing if there is more than just the single type of rock. Probably also samples from both sides - both of the rock halves. What we said this morning in terms of combining station 6 and 7 to an hour and 20 minutes -
|SCHMITT|Come on up here, Geneo. SERNAN1Okay,
|SCHMITT|If you can.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and so it's sort of your option is to how much time you spend here and how much you go on to station 7 and spend. And if you feel that it's worth while we could spend essentially all that hour and 20 minutes at this station. But, if we'did that we'd like to get a fair variety of blocks if they're available.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Geneo we sampled some of the light colored - as a matter of fact this block looks different -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's grayer, that's why I've been photographing it. What it is I think ~ it's a big blue gray rock itself is crystaline I believe. The inclusions are much more sharply defined and it's nonvesicular and it's included or at least it's in contact with the very vesicular anorthasitic gabbro right up there. See that?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Did you get some pictures of it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Look, we can get some of that light colored stuff in there along with the blue gray. Try to get as big a piece of that inclusion as we can. See that up in there.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 18:04 GET 165:11 661/3
165:11:00|SCHMITT|I think we're out of line of site with them. Ke're behind the rover.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|We can hear you loud and clear. We're just looking at rocks right now.
|CERNAN| of a light gray vesicular boulder. The one Jack just talked about with some of these larger white inclusions is less vesicular and it's a sort of blue-gray rock. And if I don't fall on my tail here I'll get - the locator is of Henry.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|We must be high enough to see some. I haven't looked back.
|CERNAN| pounding. No, I might (garbled) from this angle too. That will give them something. Little different up in there too, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| let's get the -
|SCHMITT|You want to get my scoop under there. Probably won't fall out.
|CERNAN| I don't know how many are going to come out.
|SCHMITT|Outstanding - outstanding.
|CERNAN| minute. I'll watch it, I'll watch it.
|SCHMITT|Is that it?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got it in case we'don't get anothe r one.
|SCHMITT|Hey, we're getting good at that.
|CERNAN| me get up on this here -
|SCHMITT|Why don't we get - get a bag out let me put these in a bag.
|CERNAN| get -
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Bob, 5 - 56 is one of the light colored inclusions in the blue gray rock.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Chips of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| good enough.
|SCHMITT|I got it I know where it is.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 18:04 GET 165:11 661/4
165:11:00|SCHMITT|It's not a lot of sample, but it's re presentative I think. It looks a lot like that sugary rock I sampled yesterday doesn't it. Found in the - we sampled in the - yes, it's pretty easy to break up. It's really not very coherent at all. You know I thought last night, Bob, that I sure used the word abletic for a texture that we saw in that inclusion yesterday on the south massif.
|CERNAN| I wan t t o - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 18:14 CST 165:20 GET MC-662/1
165:20:00|SCHMITT|Okay, you going to get some of that?
|CERNAN| beat up inclusionof some sort.
|SCHMITT|Oh, there's a nice piece coining out. Oh, wait a minute - don't lose it. I've got it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Got it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, we have another inclusion and on the surface has a more reddish brown texture. Interior looks pretty much the same -its a very light grey.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Looks like a fragment breccia that got caught up in this thing.
|CERNAN| I'd sure like to get that -
|SCHMITT|Well, let's see. I'm not sure its obviously a breccia. I think it may - may be a (garbled) rock with breccia inclu-s ions .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Which is - sort of in the same class.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, well, out of the big rock.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|But you can - I can't get in there Geno, you'll have to - no way -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Put your (garbled) suppose to.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I think its easier for you. - Did I give them a number on that? - No.
|CAPCOM|Negative.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Squash it - cramp it a little bit if you can a little more .
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. - 536 for the last one.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And -
|SCHMITT|Okay, let's go get the host rock here.
|CERNAN| that -
|SCHMITT|How about this one with the inclusion. Maybe I can get this one.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and - 17 - (garbled)
|SCHMITT|(garbled) optimistic.
|CAPCOM|Do you guys have a feeling that the 2 halves of the big boulder are are different rocks? Or just the same rock split?
|SCHMITT|No, they're, Ron, they're 2 - they were all 1 boulder I think. They are just 2 major rock types in the - wherever they came from and I tried to describe that to you. We have the contact in the central boulder. There are really 3 big boulders. The central boulder has the contact between the light grey rock - or the blue-grey rock and the vesicular morphosific gabbro.

|SCHMITT|that's enough. You got a piece of the -

|SCHMITT|Let me go to high here for a minute.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Its about to come. Oh - oh - oh, okay, I've got it, I've got it.
|CERNAN| put them in the same sack.
|SCHMITT|No, no let's don't - they're different, please. 537 is a chip of the blue-grey rock and the host - the blue-grey host rock - amd let me get that other one -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Pick the rock up while you're there. Its right at your (garbled)
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. And 538 is another sample of that material. Its a little dustier.

|SCHMITT|Now the blue-grey, the more you looked at it- it
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Huh?1.
|CERNAN| over - turn it over.
|SCHMITT|Well, I did. How do you want it over?
|CERNAN| Like that, so I can fix that. Okay, now give me your bag and I'll get it in there.
|SCHMITT|It - the blue-grey rock - on closer examination looks like a partially re-crystaliized fragment breccia. Its very hard - and on the

|CERNAN| better documentation on that big -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm going to go over and look at that contact.
|CERNAN| that we tried to sample and I'm going to see if I can't give you a little (garbled) —like stereo around this thing If I can stay on my feet. -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I hear you.
|CAPCOM|Yeah Houston reads you loud and clear, also.
|CERNAN| we'didn't succeed in getting samples everywhere and I'm giving you a 90 degree corner* Bob, it looks to me like there are inclusion o blue-grey in the gabbro - in the inorthsitic gabbro.
|CAPCOM|Positively outstanding.
|CERNAN| this whole big blue-grey thing is an inclusion.
|SCHMITT|Yes sir, and there's some little ones over ere.
|CERNAN| all these other fragments.-
|SCHMITT|Well that's right - its just several generations of activity and it looks like the gabbro though picked up the fragmental breccia as inclusions - Bob, I would really look that way right now. There's a
|CAPCOM|Okay, Charlie (garbled)
|SCHMITT|Its very crystalline. I'll tell you its not a breccia - not like house rock. Not to take anything away from house ro ck tho ugh1,
|CERNAN| shallow slope of a fracture here on one of the up-si ope rocks. I would assume its just part of a thing its picked up as its rolled down but if its worth sampling you might think about it. ^
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, if you can get that fairly readily, why don't you - you can perhaps just scoop it up with the bag.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|If you can get up to the rock there.
|CERNAN| line stereo and its going to be bag 557 and I'll take an after to show you where it came from.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that1,
|CERNAN| one on top about a foot and a half across and here's one, must be 2 feet across - 3 feet. And that's in the blue-grey.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 165:29 CST 18:24 MC663/1
165:29:00|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well Bob, I think I've done the best I can. I'd say that they're pretty clearly inclusions of blue-gray in the anorthositic1gabbro here near the contact.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene, your bag is hanging by one hook there. Be careful, if you can.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I gave you 557, I believe, didn't I?
|CAPCOM|Roger. We have that one. And whoever is giv ing us 5 5 7 .. .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| do it, but I got a sample of the inclusion, and it's in bag 539. Hey, Jack, that's your bag that hanging by one hook. Let me go get it.
|SCHMITT|Oh, they're talking to me, huh?
|CAPCOM|Yes.
|CERNAN| way up on top. It's blue-gray with light colored,
|SCHMITT|Put these in my bag.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Allright.
|CERNAN| older metrmorphosed compared to the major rock we just sampled. To the other blue-gray rock.
|SCHMITT|this bag is terrible. I can't. It won't latch. Man there's a dark hole in there. Don't let me . I'm not,
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay. It won't latch.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Not at this angle.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's dead or something. There, that's pretty good.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And 17, ...
|CERNAN| an example of what this thing, what the anorthositic gabbro did to the blue-gray breccia.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. And we're ready for you guys to leave this rock and press on and either get the rake soil and cores near that crater down below the rock just a shade, or else go on to some other different variety of rock in the area.
|SCHMITT|Well, I tell you going down to that crater is not a problem. Getting back up is.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well find a decent area to get the rake soil from and a couple of cores .
|SCHMITT|tell you what, Gene, I can go down there and
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 165:29 CST 18:24 MC663/2
165:29:00|SCHMITT|start a rake and you can come down there.
|CERNAN| and walk back up, Jack. Let me get a pan from right here where I got this sample.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to go over, I'll go get the rake and get the ...
|CAPCOM|17, it's not that vital to get to that crater. We just need a good place for a rake soil and a double, and a s Ingle core .
|CERNAN| pan, so that you don't, see my other pan station.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It was over there in that crater, just uphill from the Rover.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Hey, and 17, we aren't all that gun ho about that particular crater, if it's that much of ajob to get down to it and back up. Just, we just need a decent place for a rake soil sample and a single core.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Bob, we'don't move around from here too much. I tell you, these slopes are something else.
|CAPCOM|Yes. We agree with that from what we see in the television. So you can just (garble), and get them where it's the best place.
|CERNAN| but I don't think I can get to the top. I just got to get a place I can get a pan from right here. Right in this little hole. Okay, I left the gnomon down there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll have to go get it.
|CERNAN| Rove r.
|SCHMITT|I think I'll go and save some water, back on intermediate.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that
|CERNAN| here the Light Mantle is not evident until you see the angular reflection up on the scarp. Very thin like tangent might be evident out on the valley, but not nearly as pronounced as I might have though from this altitude. Oh, and there's Challenger. Holy Smoly. You know Jack, when we finish with Station 8, we will have covered this whole valley from corner to corner.
|SCHMITT|that was the idea.
|CERNAN| quite get to that far corner.
|SCHMITT|Bob, that blue-gray rock near the contact with the anorthositic gabbro does get some vesicles in it. I think they'll show up in Gene's pictures.

|SCHMITT|It would, but the stuff wouldn't stay in.
|SCHMITT|Right?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It's a thought.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I will. We're not really supposed to be selective about raking.-

|CERNAN| are an inch or so or samller. They're angular to subrounded fragments. Some of them look like the inclusions. As a matter of fact, the ones that are broken open look like some of the light colored inclusions we saw in the big boulder. The others are too dust covered to see anything about. A couple of them look very coarsely crystalline.

|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| Jack get the 500. 559 is a kilogram of soil.
|SCHMITT|I think we've pretty much covered the general variety we've seen here. I think we've seen most of them in that boulder.

|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, after - Okay, why don't you get the 500 and the RB' s on 120 .
|CAPCOM|Copy 120 there and Gene if you want to change we recommend magazine fox trot or fran as the case may be. .
|CERNAN| don't forget to get that boulder track.

|CAPCOM|Standby, Jack, we have 3 lowers and 2 uppers so we'd just as soon use the extra lower here in the single core. That'll give us 2 uppers and 2 lowers left.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Double.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 18:33 CST 165:40 GET 664/2
165:40:00|SCHMITT|Should be a lower in there Geno.
|SCHMITT|Bob, any special place you want that out here on the slope.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. Just out there on the - I guess if you saw a crater you might look at that but primarily we're looking at the crater.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|We have a couple dents in our wheels.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Did he say in a crater.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|thinking. How do I get this doggone - Been trying to come off.
|SCHMITT|You got to unlock it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, now push down and turn.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|How am I going to see up there to shoot this thing?
|CERNAN| rock? Go over there and lean against it. Well.
|SCHMITT|I have to do something, I was trying to get so I could lean against the Rover, but that ain't going to work.
|CERNAN| lean against.
|SCHMITT|It's steady enough. There's just no place to lean.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and if you'll listen for a minute I'll tell you some possible 500 mm targets the people have in mind. And one the LM if you can see it from there. Two, Nansen if you can see it from there. Three, Laura and four, Shorty. In other words I guess they're talking about looking along your traverse from yesterday. It could be mostly the back shot apparently. And then also the South Massif and I don't know what but you can get a boulder track leading up the North Massif. Also, they'll be looking down hill towards the LM Stations 2, 3 and 4. Nansen, Laura and Shorty.
|SCHMITT|I got you Bob.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got a set of the - the - what looks like the outcrop from which the boulder came.
|SCHMITT|Ah, I'm afraid they're moved a little bit.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I got a few pictures looking up the boulder track and then off to the left a little bit. And one off to the right and I think, I'm not sure how well they overlap, that's just an awful large shot.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 18:33 CST 165:40 GET 664/3
165:40:00|CAPCOM|Okay. Good on that. And if you're done with that if you got a frame count, you're still taking them I guess it looks like.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Okay, my camera is clean, magazine foxtrot is on about frame 2 and I cycled through and I've got the core all set and I'm going to go get it and I didn t hear where you said to put it, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Anywhere.
|SCHMITT|Oh, man, you're easy.
|CAPCOM|Kinda figured (garble)
|SCHMITT|Anywhere? Not the bottom of a small crate r, huh ?
|CAPCOM|Any place. And did you get your camera dusted.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. I got it all dusted and got a mag change. It's 448.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll even get you a picture of it.
|SCHMITT|Oh, me oh my.
|PAO|EVA time 2 hours and 15 minutes.
|SCHMITT|Oh me, oh my.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah. That core one is very easy, Bob. I pushed it in about a quarter way and about another 5 or 6 wacks and it's in all the way. *
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 18:42 GET 165:50 MC665/1

|CERNAN| Station 2, and what else?
|CAPCOM|And, any sort of outcrop you see in the South Massif.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, if you got those, fine.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Well --
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Stereo is stereo, is stereo, I guess.
|SCHMITT|I got your little soil -- Well, but it's not stereo; it's right along the same line.
|CERNAN| which stayed intact, very nice and round.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN| couple of bented tires.
|SCHMITT|Okay. My hands have had it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Good enough.
|SCHMITT|You aren't going to get anything else out of me if I keep taking pictures.
|CAPCOM|And, Gene, what's a dented tire?1
|CERNAN| golfbail size or smaller indentation in the mesh. How does that sound to you? Doesn't hurt anything.
|CAPCOM|Sounds like a dented tire, that's how it s o unds.

|CAPCOM|Cappy, copy, Frame 31.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| we can get to the next station with that

|CERNAN| document core you1got your stereos, we got two pans, CG camera. Okay, we're going1to head east and look for Station 7, block Horatio contact change, get a different sample of rocks.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I sure want to get one or two of those nice ones in the Big Bad While over there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene'll bring one.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, and let me know when you get ready to get back on the Rover there, 17.
|SCHMITT|Guess we'didn't open it again.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|You could put them under Jack's seat, if it's easier.
|SCHMITT|Okay, what do you want done to the SEP while I'm here? You want the blanket stayed -- left open?
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd -- Negative. We'd like the blankets closed and face down again, if possible, and both engines left off1We won't touch it again until Station 8.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it's all open. All set.
|CERNAN| for one here. It's pretty fragile.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN| this tape is full of dust now. Okay, wait a minute, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Here, let me get this thing. I'm about ready to drop it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|there's sample bag 560.
|CAPCOM|Copy, 560.
|SCHMITT|And, 560 has an undoc — undocumented except by the pans — very white — looks like a crushed anorthosite. It looks like the (garble) inclusions in the breccia. In the grey breccia — grey and recrystallized b re ccia.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN| you might try and hit that — top of that SEP down again.
|SCHMITT|I will.
|CERNAN| long time. We can hear a lot of what's going on back there.
|SCHMITT|Grab it. We can stow it away. Okay. Close it. Yeah that got it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's got it. Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, because it's not locked. It's (garble) never was locked.

|SCHMITT|Your camera lens looks all right, Gene.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Do they want it on or off? Leave it off, huh?
|CERNAN| as best you can.
|SCHMITT|Well, I'm afraid the tape has had it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You want us to tape it again, Bob? What did you do with the tape?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 18:42 GET 165:50 MC665/4

|CAPCOM|Let's worry — about let's worry about station 7 if we're going to worry about it. Press on.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yeah, let's -- let's forget it now. It's too hard to work on there, and it's not going to take just a minute. It's going to take too much time. I'm not sure I can get back on here.

|CERNAN| sample -- a large sample, you might grab it, and we'll throw it in the footpan here and — and, I' 11 see if I can t find a level spot to —
|SCHMITT|I sort of ought to have my scoop, too.
|CERNAN| much; just take that. That's all you need.
|SCHMITT|How about letting me have your hammer? (Garble)
|CAPCOM|Okay, and 17, can you verify that the - that the gnomon is back in the Rover?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 165:59 CST 18:51 MC666/1

|CERNAN| Rove r.
|SCHMITT|the rake.
|CERNAN| Rover. We got the, you put the core under your pan, right?
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN| come down and get you. It's fun walking downhill. Boy, that boulder track is impressive.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and 17, when you get moving, we want to get, and I quote, a maximum variety of hand samples with a minimum amount of documentation, in a minimum amount of time at Station?. It's just an attempt to see what kind of variety we can get along the face of the front. Over.
|CERNAN|
|PAO|Station 7 is 8 tenths of a kilometer east of Station 6, still along the base of the North Massif.
|SCHMITT|I probably ought to turn my water off of max if that's where it is. It's cold. I don't want to run out today.
|CERNAN| the pitch indicator says about 12. I don't know if I believe all that. Bob, you with us?
|CAPCOM|Go ahead. Right. We're with you.
|CERNAN|

|CERNAN| is this?
|SCHMITT|that's great.
|CERNAN| fragments on that field out there.
|SCHMITT|Be right with you.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| just about 100 meters to pick up Jack1.

|SCHMITT|Am I really on.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Is it caught.
|CERNAN| on, get up1Let me put this away. Get up, out all the way.
|SCHMITT|Oh, that thing.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's right.

|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Oh, easy. CERNN1You feel like you're on a down slope over there?
|SCHMITT|Yes. I feel like you're about ready to spin out downhill1any minute.
|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 165:59 CST 18:51 MC666/3
165:59:00|SCHMITT|Bob, it's hard to give you much looking into the Sun the way we are.
|CERNAN| looking at that little valley down there Jack. Am I right.
|SCHMITT|Yes. I think you're right. The pattern on the slope really doesn't look much different than on the light mantle. Matter of fact, it looks very much like light mantle, except for these large blocks that are in it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. And you guys may still have your visors up. We can't tell, but you might be better off with them down, if you've forgotten that they're up.
|SCHMITT|Well, I can't see. My hands work just as well as my visor, as a matter of fact.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You've got a crater right in front of you.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay, that looks like a pretty good pile to wo rk on.
|CERNAN| what heading do you want me to park on. I want to get in that flat area, Jack, so I can dust the radiators.
|CAPCOM|Gene, this is going to be a very short station. Probably not more than 10 or 15 minutes, but just a grab, as I say, a maximum variety of hand samples, with a minimum amount of documentation and a minimum amount of time.
|CERNAN| those small ones Jack.
|SCHMITT|they're trying to chip.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|We'd like to have the TV camera and it's mir ror and stuff dusted there, however. So we won't do anything abo ut it,
|SCHMITT|I thought you were going to stop back here.
|CERNAN| one .
|SCHMITT|I'm sorry. I misunderstood you. Gene there's a lot of little ones up in here I want to ...
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 19:02 GET 166:09 667/1

|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|I can't figure out where you're going to stop.
|CERNAN| as much of a level spot as I can. That's about as level a spot as I can find. I'm inside a slope of a crater.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I'm at 200 3.3.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|You want me to help you with it - that thing (garble).
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|You take a pan before and we'll start picking up some of those samples and I'll take a pan afterwards .
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|What kind of variety we can get here.
|CERNAN| breccias I think over there. Re crystalized breccias with some of that crushed anorthosite in it. I think right in here I'm going to take the pan at about.
|CAPCOM|Jack, what's your frame count?
|SCHMITT|131.
|CAPCOM|Okay, press on.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I'm going to take the pan at 118 so you can see the fragments that we are going to pick up here. Then we can take another one at the location work.

|CERNAN|
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 19:02 GET 166:09 667/2
166:09:00|CAPCOM|And - -
|SCHMITT|You notice the temperature difference with the high sun angle.
|CAPCOM|Roger, you're probably letting in a lot of infrared without having that gold visor down too. That's sort of an infrared shield.
|SCHMITT|Yes, but mine has been down all the time, Bob .
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Except in the shade. Okay 540 is the first bag of selected samples1.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm going to leave it open, but don't let me - let me get - here put that one in there.
|CERNAN| We're getting too many rocks we'don't know where they came f rom.
|SCHMITT|I don't think it will fit know it.
|CERNAN| looks like it will fit.
|SCHMITT|Okay, bag 541 is partially around another big rock in Gene's collection bag. Did you get pictures of this thing here.
|CERNAN| focus anyway. I got to do that. I was just collecting in this area.
|CERNAN| and I'm going to -
|SCHMITT|that's what I'm doing.
|CERNAN| and it's got a light, colored fragment that runs the full height of it about a. metre and a half thick and then it's got the gray or blue gray rock on the other side. As a matter of fact - let me look at it closely. It's a fragment in it alright.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that Gene. And remember to document around the corner at your target the full documentation of the boulder.
|CERNAN| but it sure looks like I see a dikelet in here that's in the inclusion. And I'm going to get a close up stereo of it. I'd call it a dikelet if you pinned me down.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN| sample right off. Here's another one - it is a dikelet. There's three or four of them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that Gene very good.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 19:02 GET 166:09 667/3
166:09:00|CERNAN| looks - yes it is (garble) it is not covering it. It's between the - it's between the lighter colored rock and the blue gray rock.
|SCHMITT|542 is another bag of goodies.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Gene, let me get rid of this.
|CERNAN| maybe it isn't a dikelet - maybe it's just a screen covering a flow covering.
|SCHMITT|No, you got - their dikes
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN| marily around a dike. It's in several pieces, but we're going to put it all in one bag, 543. Some of the men are going to have to assemble that.
|CAPCOM|Copy 543.
|CERNAN| we need to put one of those dikes in another bag.
|SCHMITT|Bob, it looks like some fraction of the blue gray material has obviously intruded. Can you get that dike there. Get that.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, get the piece with - you get more of it right there. It's this soft white inclusion again it breaks pretty easy.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It is.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And, we'd like to have you guys moving again in five minutes to get to station 8 on time.
|CERNAN|T1Yes sir. Looks like - although the blue gray up on the hill looked like a fragment breccia. If this is still related then it's been through partial melting sometime.
|CERNAN| dike and the white material.
|SCHMITT|that's what I wanted. Why don't we get this big piece of dike now.
|CERNAN| There you've still got some - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:12 CST 2005 MC 674/11.
167:12:00|CERNAN| right down hill - this little bitty boulder trail pattern goes right up the slope.
|SCHMITT|I think those are later than the crater by a long ways.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I haven't done anything -
|CERNAN| little -
|SCHMITT|Yeah, get this -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Want your gnomon over there?

|SCHMITT|Well, I'm about ready.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep.

|SCHMITT|they all gonna go in?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Great, great.
|CERNAN|

|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And this is a kilogram soil location, fe1 lows .
|CERNAN| going to have - no it isn't, but we're going to change it when we get back anyway, and that one ought to go under your seat.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.
|CERNAN| it. The kilogram is in 566.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. And, remaining here, we have primarily a trench. If you fellows think its feasible, we'd like to be moving in one one minutes, 11 minutes, and we could use a pan from this lower location also, probably.
|CERNAN| th e Rover.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that sounds good to us.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|And we also remind you of getting a pan of the lower section there.
|CERNAN| Rover, we just scoop this out. I'll get the sample here that I got documented now and -
|SCHMITT|Did you? Is that all going to go in there?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Got it. That duricrust rock may have been too much. Take that rock out, and it'll stay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:12 CST 2005 MC 674/2
167:12:00|CERNAN| it in mine, though. Well, let me try. Since we're going to unload your bag, it may be the last - the last one.
|SCHMITT|that's the last one for your bag.
|CERNAN| little crater?
|SCHMITT|No, but I'm going to right now.
|CERNAN| over there and go down and get that trench. I'll come down -
|SCHMITT|You don't want a bag, okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Boy, almost pure white and very friable. Oh, boy, is it. Pure white. Right out of small little pit crater on the side of this crater I just walked in, Houston. And it's pure white, very friable I got about, well, one big piece and several small in 567.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Bob, the walls of these craters - the big craters around here, that is, the ones that are say, 15 meters in diameter, tend to be a little bit lighter albedo than ones down in the mantle area. I'm afraid those pictures on that rake may be a little bit made to be through a dustcovered lens.
|CERNAN| here, too. Okay, where do you want this trench? On the side of this crater?
|SCHMITT|Well -
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I don't know. I don't - I was just thinking about that. I think - I think we ought to get out in the inner crater area to see if there's any stratigraphy to the - to whatever the talus is.
|CERNAN| r i gh t h e re .
|SCHMITT|I'll get it.
|CERNAN| got to pan again, but I want to fix this fender.
|SCHMITT|I guess this - the pan's mine, isn't it, this one ?
|CERNAN| b e f o re -
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, we agree with that and you might get a - you might get us the gravimeter reading there, Gene, while you are at it. (garble)
|CAPCOM|And if you have time, you might drop the gravimeter on the ground and we will get a reading with it on the ground as well.

|CAPCOM|Gently.
|CERNAN| but I'll level it. If it takes pictures or does it's thing on the Rover, it'll do its thing here.

|CERNAN| cold water, does it come in nicely. Whew. I'm really happy with this fender, really happy.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I have dug - have gotten a wall now in one place that's standing about 25 centimeters high and it shows no apparent change in the texture of the soil to that depth except possibly at the lower 5 centimeters, there's some zones that might be slightly more granular. Particle size, may be, up a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that. Probably just three samples and that will be sufficient then.

|CERNAN| system a workout. Whew. I can't even see it. - Well, every-things getting awful dusty.
|SCHMITT|Boy, everything is stiff. Everything is just full of dust.
|CERNAN| just overtakes you and everything mechanical quits moving. Like scoops. I'm not sure whether (garble) will like the fender, but it will sure buy the fix. Okay, it's fixed.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy that and copy it again. And we'd like to have you guys moving in about 3 minutes.
|SCHMITT|Good luck.
|CERNAN| s amples, huh ?
|SCHMITT|Yes sir. I think I do. I can't adjust my scoop to my belt bagging method.
|CERNAN| to save some water. Okay, now. Okay - the bottom 10 centimeters -
|SCHMITT|Can I get your bag - I left my camera off when I - well, shoot, I didn't take a picture of the trench after I dug it. Let me take one shot.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|that's the bottom.
|CERNAN| cloddy - looks very much like the surface we're standing on except it clods up quite a bit more. Did you tell them anything about the trench itself?
|SCHMITT|I told them - I talked to them a little bit abo ut it.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|It looked a little coarser grained, but that's all.
|PAO|EVA time, 3 hours 50 minutes.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN| core tubes held.
|SCHMITT|I know it.
|CERNAN| what'll I do - scan sample in the upper half centimeter. Maybe a centimeter deep.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'm putting it in your bag.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, there's no choice right now. let me see if these little ones will fit in there. Stand by, I want to put this one in there too.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 20:14CST 167:21GET MC675/2
167:21:00|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN| that scan the next 5 centimeters.
|SCHMITT|Put it down, Gene. Move it over.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|And the next 10 centimeters down - Can you get this one too?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay, that was the next 10 centi meters and then the first sample, of course, was the 10 centimeters below that.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Copy that.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. And we're ready for you guys to move out.
|CERNAN| clean up the Rover you can get a (garbled) your after (garbled) of pan. I'll get the GT and clean up the Rover.
|SCHMITT|I will.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed. We agree with that.
|CERNAN| getting keyed - it sounds like Bob's stepping on his foot mike, he's so excited he can't stand it.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Yep. I'll get the pan.
|CERNAN| clean up.
|SCHMITT|You took a pan up the hill there?
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Well, I'll take it right here then. Oh, oh -'
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|Sample came out.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|I'll pick it up.
|CERNAN| Jack. If you can't get it, i'll get it with the tongs.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead and go to work - I'll get the pan first. I lost two of them I guess.
|CERNAN| You're bag is so full they won't - let me give them a reading here. Hey, Bob, can I move in on the Rover and then give you a reading?
|CAPCOM|Yes. Go on and be careful not to hit the button while you're doing it.
|CERNAN| do it that way, I don't know why I asked you — I know I can.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 20:14CST 167:21GET MC675/3
167:21:00|CERNAN| so dusty. Okay, it's on and it's locked and here's your reading. 670 - 670 117301 - that's 670 117 301.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN| around. Jack, we've got to do some bag changing here.
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN| can't get them - you'd have to bend over. Every time you jump around you come close to losing something.
|SCHMITT|I'll just take them back there and put them under the seat.
|CERNAN|
|SCHMITT|No, I got it.
|CERNAN|
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|You got. another one dropped there, Gene - Jack got it.
|CERNAN|
|CAPCOM|Jack's getting it.
|CERNAN| for your - that full bag. Let me put this small can over there and core tube over there.
|SCHMITT|Have a sample.
|CERNAN|Okay, let me take your bag off first.
|SCHMITT|Okay, well you might as well fill it (garbled)
|CERNAN|Yeah, I. am (garbled) Good ole (laughter).
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|It's off, let me fill it.
|SCHMITT|Your bag isn't in much better shape.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'd like to have you check the Commander's bag. You might put them both under the seat there.
|CERNAN|Well, we're running out of bags, aren't we?
|SCHMITT|Okay, we've got one bag left - we should have there - it was on the gate, right?
|CERNAN|Okay. Yeah, we could have had it under the seat. Okay, bag number 4 - bag number 4 is absolutely full -and it's under Jack's seat..
|CAPCOM|Okay, I suggest that you take the other bag that's on the gate there and put that on either you or Jack and also the Commander's bag is pretty full also, we suspect.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:31 CST 2024 MC 676/1
167:31:00|CERNAN|Why don't you put it on me. Mine get full faster.
|CERNAN|Somehow.
|CAPCOM|You might check, Gene. Try again later.
|CERNAN|Help me.
|SCHMITT|Stay there, stay there. I'm trying to get the bottom rock.
|SCHMITT|Oh, I'm sorry.
|CERNAN|Alright. Check that he's got about six samples to go.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And -
|CERNAN|And I just want to be sure that it locked down .
|SCHMITT|Okay
|CERNAN|Jack, turn to the left so I can get this other ho ok.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|It's not coming I guarantee you that.
|CAPCOM|SEP 5 is one with the LMP if you want to pick it off the gate.
|CERNAN|SEP 5 is on the LMP.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|There is nothing on the gate.
|SCHMITT|Well, I think that'll stay down, but it's not very good1-
|CERNAN|Okay, I've got one more loose sample that I'm going to throw in the big bag back there.
|SCHMITT|A local one, you mean?
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Well -
|CERNAN|Well, let me leave it under your seat. Now, let's - can I1put a bag around it? No, it's got a bag around it - it's all1bagged, (garble)
|CAPCOM|While Gene's doing that, why don't you read the SEP temperature, or somebody read the SEP temperature anyway, and close the1blanket.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'll do that.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob. Let's see, you got your reading -
|SCHMITT|One two zero, Bob, one two zero.
|CAPCOM|Copy, one two zero,
|CERNAN|Those blankets just aren't staying closed. Okay, I guess1we're ready to head on out, do you agree?
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene, when you go to change the -when you go to change the LCRU, we'd like you to turn it to OFF, OFF, on the1power switch, the internal power, the external switch. And we'll be reading you through the LM, It will give you a change to cool down the LCRU on the way home from station 9,
|CERNAN|Alright. And Houston, what's the temperature limit on1the DSEA?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, Jack.
|CERNAN|Do you read us, Bob, through the LM?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we read you through the LM, do you read us through the LM?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:31 CST 2024 MC 676/2
167:31:00|CERNAN|Yeah, not as well, but we're reading you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and the temperature limit, Jack, is 160. We'll just leave it as it is until we get back to the LM.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I was going to say, we could take it out and put it1under the seat or something, but that sounds all right .
|CERNAN|Okay, an EMU status check. I'm at 3.88 and I got 48 percent, no flags, and intermediate cooling.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|And the LMP - is at 47 percent, no flags, 3.86.
|SCHMITT|Hey, Gene.
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|What - Well, Bob, I guess - remind us to change the LRV1sampler at the next station. It's almost out of bags.
|CERNAN|Well, let's do it next time around.
|CAPCOM|Okay, when you get on, Jack, you can give me a frame count as you start moving.
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN|Hang on. Need some help.
|SCHMITT|Nope.
|CERNAN|Go down hill, get your feet down hill.
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN|Let me help you. Watch it, there's a crater right behind you.
|SCHMITT|I got it.
|CERNAN|I got it.
|SCHMITT|Here, here. Grab my hand. Now just push up on my head.
|CERNAN|Yeah, hope I don't do it too hard. Going b ackwards .
|CERNAN|Alright, just push up. Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Boy, are you - you got your pockets completely filled with dirt.
|CERNAN|Well, extra samples.
|SCHMITT|Do we throw those pockets away this time around ?
|CERNAN|Extra sample.
|SCHMITT|Are you a mess.
|CERNAN|Well, that one was coming for a long time.
|SCHMITT|My hand's already tired from dusting you.
|CERNAN|That one was coming. I keep trying to blow the dust off my camera which is very frustrating.
|SCHMITT|Very ineffective, too Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay. Do we try that trick, again? You know that happened1on an upslope getting on the Rover. Okay, I'm all locked in. Let me know when you are.
|SCHMITT|How come we'don't have to point any charges? I guess the last one - I remember when that one is.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:31 CST 2024 MC 676/3
167:31:00|CAPCOM|We'll deploy one at station 10.
|CERNAN|Okay, we're heading to station 9 by about 267. Okay, and you're reading us through the LM so I won't worry about the low gain. We're powered up, switch is on. Okay, I'm gonna make a turn to the right.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and the updated headings since you're at the north end of station 8 will be something like about 240.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, 240.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I think gray sample here of Sculptured Hills. You're going to have to tell a tale combined with the observation that most of the blocks we saw were, like Gene sampled, looked like sub-floor gabbro. It's conceivable that the Sculptured Hills could be the same kind of material. 11think it's fairly clear that the boulder population does not resemble the Massif population at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Heh, heh, heh.
|CERNAN|Have we been riding on this downslope all the time?
|SCHMITT|Yes, but -
|CERNAN|And hadn't said anything, huh.
|SCHMITT|Scary, isn't it?
|CERNAN|Man, I'm glad I'm driving.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, when you're not holding on with two hands, we'd like the frame count from you.
|SCHMITT|Wait a minute. Yeah.
|CERNAN|Is that Van Serg over there?
|SCHMITT|Ahhhh -
|CAPCOM|You have a bearing of 234 and a range of 21decimal 1.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|We got to get around left here and then -
|SCHMITT|(garble)
|CERNAN|Yeah, and then head on more westerly.
|SCHMITT|LMP frame is at 80.
|CAPCOM|Copy 80.
|CERNAN|SWP or Bowen I mean. Bowen I guess.
|SCHMITT|Well, yeah that SWP over there. Bowen is out here ahead of us.
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Bowen - Bowen is much of a crater on the map .
|CERNAN|225 - what did you say, Bob, 225? what?
|CAPCOM|2342.1. Heading ought to be about 240, 240 for heading to there.
|CERNAN|Did you hear him?
|SCHMITT|I didn't hear him.
|CERNAN|2 40 -
|SCHMITT|You're not reading him?
|CERNAN|What did he say for bearing and range? That's what I'm interested in.
|CAPCOM|2342.1.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:31 CST 2024 MC 676/4
167:31:00|CERNAN|Okay, I got that.
|PAO|Station 9 is 2.3 kilometers from station 8 and we estimate driving time 18 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we think you're even further north as I was saying — maybe about 215 if you're heading for the re.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, I'll find it. 2 342.1.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|And all the big blocks still look like sub-floor from the Rover. The big blocks in here are only about a third of a meter in diameter and there's some rounded and some angular. Okay, we're up on the plains again now just off the brink and slope.
|PAO|Station 9 is Van Serg crater which could be of volcanic origin.
|CERNAN|I sure think that looks like outcrop down in the East Massif on the lower slopes if it were the high albedo. Doesn1 t it?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it does.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:40 CST 20:34 MC 677/1
167:40:00|SCHMITT|one of my guidelines for the geophone deploy— men t1.
|CERNAN|There's some more of the blue gray rock here in the east end of the South Massif down low.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. It looks like it might have been a slump block or something.
|CERNAN|Yeah, you can see it's blue gray because of contrast with the light mantle.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. It might be a slump block, or something like that.
|CERNAN|Jack, I want to go to the left.
|SCHMITT|You going to go soon? (Laughter) Need 2 trees
|CERNAN|No, I'm going over here, it's closer.
|SCHMITT|Okay, that's probably Bowen there. Don't you think?
|CERNAN|I - think - well -
|SCHMITT|How about a range in bearing.
|CERNAN|(Garbled) get too far east. Okay, it's 2283.4. And we're moving along at 10 to 12 clicks. That's all it 11 hack.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. How about an amps reading. We haven't had one of1those for a couple of -
|SCHMITT|Starting to rain again. Got a crater ahead of you.
|CERNAN|Oh, boy.
|SCHMITT|Downsun isn't much easier than upsun.
|CERNAN|It's just easier on the eyes. Just can't see anymore that's all. You don't have that static, huh?
|SCHMITT|No. Let's see if we still have an antenna. I haven't looked recently.
|CERNAN|Hope there's no holes in the high gain.
|SCHMITT|Might have hit it on a rock. Oh boy.
|CERNAN|Okay, the - we're back into the mantle area population of fragments is still 1 percent or so. The crater off to our left which is at 227 and 3.
|SCHMITT|What is that 3.1 -
|CERNAN|3.3; 22733. Is a very good sized depression, but it's completely mantled, there's no blocks showing in the wall at all. How do you read, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear. We're listening.
|CERNAN|Now there's that crater in the wall of that depression or near it and it has one big block in the side as if it penetrated the mantle and exposed some of the wall of the depression. Just about a 30 meter crater. Valley of Taurus-Littrow is not plainer.
|SCHMITT|No, it isn't.
|CERNAN|I'm glad we changed it to subfloor, instead of the plains unit. (Laughter),
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:40 CST 20:34 MC 677/2
167:40:00|CERNAN|Okay, we're in the inner wall of the depression here and the rocks still look like subfloor gabbro. Boy, there's certainly not much variety. General there's a few exotics.
|SCHMITT|Oh, now that's got to be Cochise. Ah, look at Cochise.
|CERNAN|That's Cochise.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We think you're coming up on Cochise.
|SCHMITT|Let me take a couple pictures while we're looking right at it.
|CERNAN|Swing right. Swing right. Bob, we are on the northeastern rim of Cochise. I'm going to work my way around the other side. And Bob, looking at the western wall of Cochise, I can see a contact within the subfloor between a albedo units, one of which Is a light tan gray and the other is a light blue gray. May reflect the two kinds of subfloor gabbro we've already sampled. Vesicular and nonvesicular. And that contact looks like it was dipping - a fair dip in the wall but to the north. And the west wall dipping to the north about 20 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Which one's on top? Can you tell?
|CERNAN|Yeah. The blue gray's on top. I'm sorry.
|CAPCOM|Thank you. And you got a bearing and range there at the rim of Cochise?
|CERNAN|I took a picture of it. Okay, we're at 228 3.0 and we're headed south and not quite on the east rim.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|CERNAN|I'll give you a hack at the east rim.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I got a picture of that contact so, I took some pictures right into Cochise when we were coming up.
|CERNAN|Good, it'll show on yours too, I hope.
|CERNAN|Okay, we're sort of on the inner - mark 2302.9, we're on the east rim.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Well, we're sort of inside the east rim a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Well, don't get too far inside.
|CERNAN|We're half way between the rim and where the blocky wall starts.
|CAPCOM|All right. Copy that.
|CERNAN|Did you get that, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Yeah. We got that.
|SCHMITT|Cochise is much like Horatio and actually more like Camelot although not as blocky In the walls in general in that it has blocky walls but a mantled rim. Again all the blocks I see in here are big ones and blocks down to about 20 centimeters are subangular in general and appear to be the - have the appearance of the subfloor gabbro. Although most, of the small rocks are not do not appear to be highly vesicular.
|CAPCOM|All right. We're copying that all.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 167:40 CST 20:34 MC677/3
167:40:00|CERNAN|We're at 2 32 and 2.7.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that.
|SCHMITT|Watch it.
|CERNAN|You know what happened there?
|SCHMITT|What?
|CERNAN|I was just about to take a picture and the minute you take your eye off anything -
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I got another view of that contact, and let's put that1- let's put that on the northwest wall of Cochise and dipping to1the southeast.
|SCHMITT|All right. South and east is to our left -
|CERNAN|No, no no no no. Put it on the northwest wall dipping to the northeast.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's right. See that Geno, can you see that over there?
|CERNAN|Oh, yeah I can see it now between the gray and blue gray?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|Oh, yeah. Yes I sure do.
|SCHMITT|Can you swing in there and let me get another shot of it?
|CERNAN|You bet you.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's a good view right here. Okay now, I need to1have you go left.
|CERNAN|Okay. I got two of them in there too.
|CERNAN|Look at that rock right in front of us. It looks like a contrast between a blue and a gray.
|SCHMITT|Oh, yeah, there it is. Yeah you're right.
|CERNAN|We can't get down to it but take a picture.
|SCHMITT|Well, I think we - I think we've got that relat i onship.
|SCHMITT|I think we got it at station 1 -
|CERNAN|That's a big beautiful boulder on the -
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's -
|CERNAN|In the rim - inner south rim of Cochise -it's a single block.
|SCHMITT|that's how you mend your tires.
|CERNAN|Man, that's what it's for. Boy that's a mound - oh man would that be -
|SCHMITT|that might be glass covered. That might be glass coating the way it sort of hangs on the outside there. Hard to s ay.
|CERNAN|We're at 234 2 .5.
|SCHMITT|Starting to sling dust. I wonder if we've lost our fender.
|CERNAN|No, they're on there tight. (Garbled)
|SCHMITT|there it is.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 20:43 GET 167:50 MC-678/1
167:50:00|SCHMITT|there - there it is. Betcha.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I think you're right, 'cause that's just about the right place. Let's see, 234 okay, and 2 point 1 is where we want to go and I have a 230 2 point 5. Okay our - pretty close - our block population in here now on the south rim of Cochise and up ahead of us looks like it's up to 5 percent and it all looks like subfloor light to tan subfloor gabbro to tan grey. You don't see much blue grey, not out on here.
|SCHMITT|there's a recent hit.
|CERNAN|This Rover is getting tested for what it was built for now.
|SCHMITT|Yeap.
|CERNAN|Now, I'll tell you it handles, just the way it's advertised. Maybe even better.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we think you guys are getting to the point where you ought to swing a little bit west to make the 2, 3, 4, 2.1.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I am, Bob.
|SCHMITT|We got that gabbro.
|CERNAN|Bob, that's my fix - I'm just navigating to it .
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|I know where when I get there.
|SCHMITT|You'll never tally ho on Shorty, I mean (garble) How about you there, Joe. Thanks.
|CAPCOM|Let's not prejudge the (garble) to much.
|CERNAN|You want 2, 3, 4, 2.1, okay.
|CAPCOM|(garble)
|CERNAN|You wonder like our wander factor in here has got to be 50 percent.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Bob, you're being cut out, I can't tell what you1re saying. Is that where we want to go, over there.
|CERNAN|2,3-
|SCHMITT|Well - good, then we've found the crater.
|CERNAN|2 3 4, 2 3 2 -
|CAPCOM|It doesn't make much difference, 17 - Do you see van SVR, that's what we want.
|SCHMITT|I may wander over that way, that's where I want to get but I couldn't go there because of that -there's a different looking rock there.
|CAPCOM|Remember, we were talking about parking on the southeast rim.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I think you're going to have to b ear ri ght.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I've got to get through this field tho ugh.
|SCHMITT|I know (laughter).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 20:43 GET 167:50 MC-678/2
167:50:00|CERNAN|Hey, Bob, we're still primarily in an extreme black field here now it its up to a 20 per cent cover and fragments mostly the subfloor. Some of it looks quite highly shattered. There's - I just saw one piece that looked like a white anorthosite rock.
|SCHMITT|How's this look to you.
|CERNAN|We go further up there, I guess. Let me go further up there.
|SCHMITT|Well, okay, get further southeast - a little higher but you don't have to over do it.
|CERNAN|There are - there is some greyish rocks that are - oops - I bent it.
|SCHMITT|Barrack coming up here. I turn to the right and park right here.
|CERNAN|that have a some what of a swirl texture. Okay, Bob, we're at 230 2 point 2.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. Copy your park.
|CERNAN|Yeap, What did I say 230 on that. Yeah, bearing is 230 2 point 2 and I'm parked on a heading of 3 2 0 which gives you a better view.
|CAPCOM|Copy 3 2 0 for the parking.
|CERNAN|Yeah, 3 - 3 3 0.
|SCHMITT|Oh boy, it's getting harder and harder. Got it in a knot also. Don't know what's wrong with itl it now, I might have got it twisted. Here let me look at it. Got a hook but not so I can get it undone. Here let me look at it.
|CERNAN|I'd say stay put, but I don't think you have any choice.
|SCHMITT|AH ha, that suddenly just curled under, that's where we're getting the dust - starting to warp, I guess those other sectors, talking about warping, did I get it twisted or something.
|CERNAN|Yeah, you did twist it when you put it on. Okay, squanch down.
|SCHMITT|I'm squanched.
|CERNAN|Okay. Got one twist in it.
|SCHMITT|Boy, that makes a difference.
|CERNAN|Sure does. Here, your foot pads down too.
|SCHMITT|I'll get it. It's lost it's stiffness in there. Hey - hey, I guess now I'm flying for Shorty, huh. Hey VAN SVR. 2 powers on -
|CERNAN|That third looks like a blocky rim fresh impact crater right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. How about cupping your feet.
|CERNAN|(Garble) Don't worry.
|CAPCOM|And, Gene, before you go away, we'd like the rest of the Rover readouts, like batteries and how about a SEP temp readout before one of you guys leave there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 20:43 GET 167:50 MC-678/3
167:50:00|CERNAN|Can you get that on that side, Jack. Could have TV.
|CAPCOM|Rog» we have it and I'm sure that Ed would like a good dusting job up front.
|SCHMITT|Well, there's so much.
|CERNAN|I'll dust it if you can't read it.
|SCHMITT|I've got it.
|CERNAN|I'll get it - just over the gauge. It's about 1 2 - 125 on the SEP.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|Boy, everything is really bad now.
|SCHMITT|the fender -
|CERNAN|Yeah, the fender dug under, see if you can straighten that out.
|SCHMITT|Okay, (garble) 8 2 and 8 0. Battery 1 22 at off scale low. Forwards are 2 10 2 4 0 Rears are 2 2 5 at 2 2 2 0.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN|That's just a sample of the kind of dust we would have got, Jack, if we hadn't of had that fender yesterday. Fender's almost worn out.
|SCHMITT|Can you get a dust brush and we'll check our camera. Stay where you are and I'll give you a (garble) wherever you are.
|CERNAN|Okay. Got it. Okay, how many bags do I h ave.
|SCHMITT|i don't know, but I've got a lot of dusting to do1here. Do you have a lot of bags.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I must have. I've got 4 of them is all.
|SCHMITT|I'd better change my bag. Can't even read the Rover.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I have an empty bag on me now, right, collection bag.
|SCHMITT|Empty.
|CERNAN|How much time do we have here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, we're looking at a nominal station 9 here. You've got about 2 5 minutes remaining.
|CERNAN|No such thing as a nominal station anymore.
|CAPCOM|This may be the first and only one of the traverse.
|SCHMITT|Geology won't let it be nominal. Hey I've got some1new bags, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that, Jack.
|SCHMITT|And I guess I'm pretty good on film -
|CAPCOM|Okay, and you're going to get a radio (garble) here1and so you might check your Rover sample bag s upp1y .
|SCHMITT|that's right, I want to take that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 20:43 GET 167:50 MC-678/4
167:50:00|CAPCOM|And you might give me frame counter check to make1sure you're okay.
|SCHMITT|I just did and it's 123.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good enough.
|CERNAN|How do you want the SEP blankets?
|CAPCOM|Leave them closed, please, Gene, as closed as they'll get.
|CERNAN|Closed.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 20:52 CST 167:59 GET MC679/1
167:59:00|CERNAN|We been riding with this thing off?
|SCHMITT|What?
|CERNAN|That.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it should be off?
|CERNAN|It is. Doesn't seem like it'd get much data that way.
|SCHMITT|Even if it's hot?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, but it's automatic, (garble) when you get to 508. So it's no good anyway.
|CERNAN|(garbled)
|CERNAN|Are you kidding. We're - oh, boy.
|CAPCOM|We've been hoping all day - it's been off all day. We've been hoping that it would - since station 6, we've been hoping that it would cool down so we could get some more data, but it's not obviously.
|SCHMITT|It's not going to make it, Bob.
|CAPCOM|That's obvious by now.
|SCHMITT|that's a shame. This is going to look like a geological survey expedition. The vehicle's are all covered with dust.
|SCHMITT|On what's in there.
|PAO|EVA time 4 hours 27 minutes.
|SCHMITT|I don't think I can read that unless I dust it with a lens brush.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Get my - Help me. Okay, can I get by you here.
|CERNAN|My bag look alright to you.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it's still closed.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay. What are we going to do here. We're going to go up there and sample on the rim, the walls and the floor and miscellaneous and -
|CERNAN|Well, we are on the rim.
|SCHMITT|- then you're going to take 500 milli meters when you get back to the Rover while I do a radial s ample.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|But the - the first thing we'do is go up to the crater.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I think the mantle objective here really is imaterial and - because there are blocky ejecta around the crater covers - oh, boy, well, it looks like it extends several hundred meters out from the rim. Say a couple of hundred meters.
|CAPCOM|All right. Copy that, Jack.
|SCHMITT|We're quite a ways - we're pretty close to the rim.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we can see that.
|SCHMITT|We're pretty close - I'll go up on
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 20:52 CST 167:59 GET MC679/2
167:59:00|SCHMITT|the rim, Gene, and see what we've got.
|SCHMITT|tiptoe through the tulips -
|CAPCOM|Okay. Let's get grabs before you guys leave.
|CERNAN|I'm getting it right now. Is there anything else you want me to do while I m here.
|CAPCOM|Negative.
|SCHMITT|Sure look like shock rocks to me.
|CERNAN|Lot of glass splattered on some of these, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|CERNAN|We might even find some shattercones . But don't tell anybody.
|CERNAN|Well, I'll say one thing for Old Man Serge it's blocky. Whoo^ Mark gravimeter.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Bob, this is about - I think this is the only clearly - well I won't even say that. This is at least a blocky - a large blocky rim crater. But even it has the mantle dust material covering the rim, sparsly buried rocks, and it's down on the floor, as near as I can tell. And on the walls. The crater itself has a central mound of blocks that's probably 50 meters in diameter that's a little high - 30 meters in diameter, It's - many of the blocks are -
|CERNAN|Holy moley^
|SCHMITT|- intensely shattered in that area, as the ones that are on the wall. I don't see any sign or organization of the blocks in the walls right now. There s a possibility that on the west wall there s an indication that there's slightly darker gray rocks starting about half way down the crater and that's - that level is coincident with what appears to be a bench on the northwest wall. And that bench - hints of that bench - it's not continuous but hints of it are around on the north wall and I think right below us on the southeast wall. The - We'll start -the rocks are pretty badly broken in many cases and — well, I haven't seen any real glass yet. We'll start at them looking now a little more carefully.
|CERNAN|That looks like a breccia right there. Infrontofus.-
|SCHMITT|Yeah, there's some interesting patterns on the s urf ace.
|CERNAN|Stand by. SCHMIT1Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Sorry, Geno, but -
|CERNAN|Okay?-
|SCHMITT|Okay. Afraid I haven't been doing my duty on locators occasionally.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 20:52 CST 167:59 GET MC679/3
167:59:00|CERNAN|Do that?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I got it.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Gene's there in a about one of the -
|CERNAN|There you go.
|SCHMITT|- very intensely fractured rocks and it comes off in small flakes. Let's get this one because this will be the best oriented one for documentation plus why don't you get that one you've got inside there.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I am.
|SCHMITT|Got a bag?
|SCHMITT|Bag 568 is a fragment from the surface. That's the corner I think, off of a block that Gene documented here. We'll get another sample that'll be from inside the block.
|CERNAN|Yeah, but that's real easy.
|CERNAN|There's a whole big - I got that just as it is. Well, put it in your - put a bag around one end if we can here the other end is smaller.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, let me hold this end. Let me hold it and you put the bag on.
|CERNAN|That's a breccia too. That's -
|SCHMITT|Well -See that. See the white fragment th e r e ?
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|It's certainly got a lot of very small -
|CERNAN|It looks like this big one over here.
|SCHMITT|You know, it might be that the - these are - might be pieces of the projectile. I don't know.
|SCHMITT|Cause it doesn't look like it's - it's not sub floor.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:01CST 168:08GET MC 680/1
168:08:00|SCHMITT|Okay, pin it down,
|CERNAN|Well, that's wrapped in - if you put it end down it may stay in the bag.
|SCHMITT|I doubt it. What's the number?
|CERNAN|It's a 480 and it's a relatively tabular shape and it's about 10 inches long -
|SCHMITT|It's gonna - and it's highly pliable. It b re aks apart.
|CERNAN|Oh, not so much.
|SCHMITT|In small chips. Well, can - you did it with your hands there — I call that being pliable - compared to what we've seen anyway.
|CERNAN|Okay and let me get an after of that -
|SCHMITT|(garbled) soil - soil right over here.
|SCHMITT|Okay, the soil next to the boulder down to about 3 centimeters -
|CERNAN|That's in bag 569.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|And the soil and chips about two-thirds of a meter from the boulder - are in bag 570.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Okay?
|SCHMITT|Let me get over here. You're going to step on your gnomon there.
|CERNAN|Ah, I wouldn't step on my gnomon.
|SCHMITT|Come on. - Okay. There very clearly is a central mound and now that we've looked at this one the mounds looks like it's composed of grey fragment breccias much like what we've just sampled. Dark grey, then again it might be - related to the projectile. Now we've got to see if there is sub-floor up here or whether we're dealing with another unit somewhere. Get your after -
|CERNAN|Okay, I don't see any -
|SCHMITT|- more coherent rock - this looks like sub floor.
|CERNAN|I don' t see any orange material either.
|SCHMITT|Not yet.
|CERNAN|This particular rock we've sampled has tabular fractures and in one-half of the rock they are definitely oriented.
|SCHMITT|Boy, I'll tell you, I don't - There's more dust on these rocks. It's harder to see a fresh surface. They're not as clean. That's sub-floor.
|CERNAN|Hey, even the floor of the crater is mantled down th e re .
|SCHMITT|You know, that seems - yeah - that seems like a - what you got? A piece of glass?
|CERNAN|Yeah, I think it is glass. At least it's glass covered - just glass covered. Houston, I've got an undocumented sample. It's about 2 meters left of where we just sampled. It's a glass covered - oh - baseball size rock in 571.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:01CST 168:08GET MC 680/2
168:08:00|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|A lot of these blocks up here, Houston, are - particularly the more fractured ones - but even some that aren't, are a grey matrix fragment breccia and it looks like really the fragments are quite fine. There are no - on the ritn anyway, we haven't seen any large fragments. The largest I've seen is about 2 centimeters. But down in the mound you can see some fragments that are probably half a meter in diameter.
|CERNAN|Jack, are you going around that rim of the crater up there?
|SCHMITT|I was just looking at rocks.
|CERNAN|Well, okay. We want to see it before we leave back there.
|SCHMITT|Oh, yeah. We need to see it - we can get some of the sub-floor - I'm not sure I understand what's happened here, yet. This should have brought up sub-floor according to the theory and it hasn't.
|CERNAN|That looks like some of the - look at some of the breccias - the blue breccias with the white - look at those clammy white -
|SCHMITT|With the fractured place with the white -
|CERNAN|Yeah - inclusions.
|SCHMITT|Down there.
|CERNAN|Yeah, down in the floor, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, it has that appearance all right. Hey, Gene, do you see that rock?
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Isn't that rock fractured in sort of a pyramid shape down there? Out here on the — Right, right end of the floor down there — that big one? It's sort of pointing west.
|CERNAN|Yeah, that, there's another one that's fractured (garbled)
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, and Gene, we'll be moving from here in about 10 minutes so we probably better be turning back toward the Rover unless you're seeing something really great out there.
|SCHMITT|Well, hey Bob, we ought to find out whether or not - whether - what the rock is here if you've got a little time.
|CAPCOM|Rog. But you got 10 minutes, I'm just telling you to start thinking about getting back.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we're always thinking that way.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob. One thing I noticed we'do un cover - there's a lot of - 2, 3, 4 millimeters size fragments of glass we're kidking up all over the place.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Hey Gene,
|CERNAN|Little pieces of glass - almost like (garbled)
|SCHMITT|Gene.
|CERNAN|yeah.
|SCHMITT|Can you come over here?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:01CST 168:08GET MC680/3
168:08:00|SCHMITT|I think there's some sub-floor here. We ought to -
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|We ought to try to document it but I tell you, most of the rocks are the fine fragment breccias.
|CERNAN|Let me see if I can't get one of those -
|SCHMITT|there's some glass.
|CERNAN|You see if they're like (garbled)
|SCHMITT|(Garbled) eyeballs or whatever they are.
|SCHMITT|I think we can get some over here. If you're careful coming over here we can get glass that looks like it may have crystallized in place there.
|CERNAN|Okay, I'm talking about those little balls too.
|SCHMITT|take it easy - Take it easy.
|CERNAN|Are you right there.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, but put your gnomon right over here and we can get that for glass and that for sub-floor. But I'm not sure that is. It may be breccia there - everything is covered with dust here and it's hard to tell the types. Most of the rocks we're seeing are breccias. Make sure that that glass is in your stereo. Okay, be careful with it. Oh » shoot.
|CERNAN|I don't have any bags so - Okay, the glass, it looks like a glass of glutenate - Oh no -
|SCHMITT|Did it break? Good. I think that will survive going back now.
|CERNAN|Okay, it's a - Bob, the glutenate is going to be in bag 481.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|And it looks like a - almost like a (garbled) type of bomb,1if you'll pardon the expression.
|CAPCOM|I will. I (garbled)
|SCHMITT|It's an aggregate of glass in - it's a pile of about14 fragments, much like the one we're sampling.
|CERNAN|Jack, we want to get a good scoop sample here maybe we can get some of those little fine pieces of glass -
|SCHMITT|And it looks like it's in place from the day it was born,
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Oh - (garbled) I'm having a time with th is one .-
|SCHMITT|A piece of that rock right behind it.
|CERNAN|(garbled)
|SCHMITT|Want a bag?
|CERNAN|Yeah.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 168:18 CST 2111 MC 681/1
168:18:00|SCHMITT|Just not going to be able to get that one in the bag, I don't think.
|PAO|EVA time 4 hours 45 minutes.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Houston, my samples in 482 is rock but it doesn't look like sub-floor, it looks like a blue-gray material we've been seeing in breccia-type material.
|CERNAN|Yep.
|SCHMITT|I don't think there's difference.
|CERNAN|Got it in.
|SCHMITT|Might as just throw them in my bag.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and -
|CERNAN|You want a scoop out of here, though, Jack.
|CAPCOM|17, why don't we get that scoop sample as the first sample of Jack's radio sample? 17.
|CERNAN|Okay, that's right, you're getting a radio sample. That's fine. I forgot you were doing that. Oh, man. That's alright, Jack, that won't come out. Just put it in there .
|SCHMITT|Oh, boy1.
|CERNAN|Let's let that one be the last one.
|SCHMITT|Here's one.
|CERNAN|Well, okay. Those are the last ones that you can take. Going to lock?
|SCHMITT|No, I don't see in my book on that. Okay. Okay, before you go back -
|CERNAN|I gotta go down after a picture.
|SCHMITT|And I want to get a pan of this thing - we get a stereo pan -
|SCHMITT|And you start your radio baffle.
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|You - you take the after from there and I'll go over here and -
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Well, wait a minute.
|CERNAN|You need a gnomon?
|SCHMITT|No.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I'm going to go over behind me and take part of the stereo. Where are you going to take your p an, let me see.
|CERNAN|From behind me, where we were.
|SCHMITT|Well, I think I'll just take my radio from here to the Rover.
|CERNAN|That's great. That's great. Just do that and you'll be right back at the Rover.
|SCHMITT|And I'll take my pan from here so you -
|CERNAN|Man, there's about four or five different modes of travel out here. I don't believe it.
|SCHMITT|What?
|CERNAN|I think I'm out of film.
|SCHMITT|You're out of film?
|CERNAN|150 and it stopped clicking. Jack, I didn't get the rest of that crater down there.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 168:18 CST 2111 MC 681/2
168:18:00|CERNAN|I only got it 12 o'clock and around. Oh, shucks.
|SCHMITT|I can get it.
|CERNAN|Well, here's what I -
|SCHMITT|Well, I'm going to be out of film, too, here before long. Okay, just don't worry about it then. Just put it down with your radio.
|CERNAN|I got a good pan over here. Did you get the crater at all?
|SCHMITT|I got the right half of it and probably two thirds of it so we're going - I'm just going to have to let that do.
|CERNAN|Okay, I'm going to see if I can get some 500s while you're doing that.
|SCHMITT|Say, this isn't going to be an ideal radio samples but it will have to do.
|CERNAN|Giddy-ap and over hill and dale. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, dah. (More singing)
|CERNAN|Bob, would you tell me what your primary desires are again on the 500, based upon what we have?
|CAPCOM|Okay, the primary desire will be the North Massif, the blocks and the trail.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And while you're at the Rover, they want you to take the gravimeter off again and we'll get another Rover and a - well another surface measure as well, to check against the Rover.
|CERNAN|Okay. Here's the reading. I think I owe you one of those, don't I?
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN|670037801, 670037801.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|I didn't know we were going to do both of these things. I thought we were going to do one or the other, but if we're going to do it, we might as well do it right. Bob, it gets flashes. Hey bag - stand by - 52 Yankee is at the rim ere s t.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to use the Rover to steady the 500 and see what happens.
|SCHMITT|I should have let you take this scoop back. Oh, no. Oh, me, well - shoot - this isn't working out too well, Doctor Parker.
|CAPCOM|Say again, there Jack.
|SCHMITT|this Isn't working out too well. I've got to get rid of this scoop.
|CERNAN|Just set it there and take your sample. We'll get it.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 168:28 CST 21:21 MC 682/1
168:28:00|SCHMITT|Just like in training, the scoop doesn't stay locked to the (garbled).
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17, we'd like you to press on, we'll abort the radio sample. We'd like to leave here immediately if not sooner to head for station 10. Enough of the 500 milimeters Gene. And we'll give you some information here on mags. We need the gravimeter put back on the Rover, if you haven't already. If it's on the ground, we'didn't get the mark, but it's probably done by now. And we're going to take the DSEA out of the tape recorder here and we'd like to get that all done pronto.
|CERNAN|Okay, 85 is the mag count on the 5 00 .
|CAPCOM|Copy 85 on the 500.
|SCHMITT|I think that's a smart move, Bob. I don't think the radio samples are going to tell you much here.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Let's take a -
|SCHMITT|I don't under - I - I -
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CERNAN|Jack, you ought to get a scoop of that dirt tho ugh.
|SCHMITT|Well, there's one scoop - we'don't have a scoop of it, do we? Look what's underneath it.
|CERNAN|No, I don't know what's underneath it.
|SCHMITT|It's white.
|CERNAN|Well, I wanted to make sure we got some of those small glass balls.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, we'll get a scoop of it. (Laughter).
|CAPCOM|17, we're anxious for you guys to get going.
|CERNAN|Okay, here's your gravimeter reading from the surface. 670057101 - 670 057 101.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Want me to change my mag at the next station?
|SCHMITT|Come here, Gene, quickly. We can't - we can't leave this. This may be the youngest mantle over whatever
|CERNAN|Take pictures of it. I don't have any film.
|SCHMITT|Was thrown out of the craters.
|CERNAN|Take pictures of it. Bob, we've got to take 5 more minutes. We'11 be right with you.
|CERNAN|What Jack's doing is dug a trench in the southwest-northeast direction and he discovered about 3 inches below - just below the surface a very light gray material. Possibility here -
|SCHMITT|Careful, Geno.
|CERNAN|Yep.
|SCHMITT|take that crust.
|CERNAN|Well, I'm trying - I'm trying to get the upper portion there. There we go.
|SCHMITT|First 2 centimeters bag 483, the next 5 in 484, ah, get some?
|CERNAN|I got quite a bit.
|SCHMITT|that's enough.
|CERNAN|I got quite a bit.
|SCHMITT|Here, you got to put that away, don't you?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 168:28 CST 21:21 MC 682/2
168:28:00|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|And the next 10 centimeters of the light gray material, be in - probably in 486, if we're lucky. (Garble) get it off.
|CERNAN|Okay. I think it is 486.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|4 85 .
|SCHMITT|485. Okay. What did I say 483, 484? Okay.
|CERNAN|You with us, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're with you.
|SCHMITT|He's mad at us now.
|CAPCOM|How'd you guess.
|CERNAN|Okay, the third sample is in 485.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Okay. Whoops, sorry. Bob, a possibility here is that the - this upper 6 inches of gray material in here, is the latest mantling in the area and the light colored debris may be what's left over from the impact.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy. I understand. But we'd like to get you going. In case you didn't get the clue.
|CERNAN|I know. We're going. Okay.
|SCHMITT|All right. What else? Magazines.
|CERNAN|No, we'll change them at the next station. Isn't that right, Bob?
|SCHMITT|No, I've got to have some. I got to get some or I can't take -
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17 we need Jack to put on magazine Nancy, and we'd like Gene, for you to pull out the DSEA tape recorder at this station.
|CERNAN|Okay, I need a magazine too, Bob, I don't have any film at all.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That'll be a problem if you change yours here. You can change it at station 10.
|CERNAN|I'll change it here. It's just as easy while we're in there.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you want Bravo, huh?
|CERNAN|Bravo. I'll get the tape - I'll get the DSEA.
|SCHMITT|Bravo was outside there, I saw it.
|SCHMITT|there you go. Let me get this - hold it far enough from me to get this. I can get rid of this all at one time.
|CERNAN|Oh.
|SCHMITT|that's all right.
|CERNAN|I can't put that back in.
|SCHMITT|Got it?
|CERNAN|I've got Bravo.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got that one. Roll out the dark slide on a Bravo and it's in the dirt. I'm not going to pick it up.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 168:28 CST 21:21 MC 682/3
168:28:00|CAPCOM|All right, copy that. There's no point in putting them back in. They probably wouldn't go anyway.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's dirty.
|CERNAN|Okay, I'm changed. And I don't know what mag count is but let me get the DSEA. If this thing is true to form I'm going to have to get in there - I got it. Oh, it tripped. They're on our works.
|SCHMITT|Hey, we got some rocks in that big bag. Okay, we're done with the SEP. DSEA is coming out. I hope there is something on it.
|CERNAN|Oh - Jimminy Christmas - I can't even pick up that big bag to close the gate.
|SCHMITT|I've got to trip that latch with tongs or something to lock it.

|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've -
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|We've had a change of heart here again as usual. And we're going to drop Station 10 now that we've heard you so much and we're going to get a double core here. And we'd like to get the - some football size rocks while you're doing that - but double core here and then we're going to leave here and go back to the LM.
|SCHMITT|You don't want to - you don't want to double core here. I don't think we can do it Bob, it's too rocky.
|CERNAN|Do you think we can get through that stuff you just trenched.
|SCHMITT|Well, I'm afraid your rocks all through it Gene. We can try.
|CERNAN|Let's try.
|SCHMITT|Well, I don't like to try things that there is a probability of failure on - if you can - you're just going to lose some time. Okay, Mag Nancy is on the LMP's camera.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Hey, this is - you can see the rock popula tion here, Houston. But we can try it.
|CERNAN|Try it, if we get a single - we get a single out of it.
|SCHMITT|Oh, you're doing it, huh?
|CERNAN|I've got it started.
|SCHMITT|Well you're not even - okay. Not even going to debate the issue.
|CERNAN|No, it takes too much time debating it.
|SCHMITT|Well, let's see how much time it takes. I hope you're right.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|And we need a lower out of my bag.
|SCHMITT|Let me get the core.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72, GET 168:28 CST 21:21 MC 682/4
168:28:00|CERNAN|A lower out of my bag is all we need.
|SCHMITT|Watch it you're in a crater hole.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I want to get it for you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we have to have you guys moving in 10 minutes and1we'd like to also deploy EP number 5 here.
|SCHMITT|Okay. I'll start on it.
|CERNAN|The lower -
|SCHMITT|What is it, 5?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 21:31 GET 168:38 MC-683/1
168:38:00|SCHMITT|this is a lower, right?
|CERNAN|Yeap.
|SCHMITT|You got an upper?
|CERNAN|Yeap. Kow did you get 5 out there at the core.
|SCHMITT|(garble) and I'll put it - I'll put that right there.
|CERNAN|Okay, the lower is 5 0 the upper is 3 7.
|CAPCOM|Copy. 5 0 and 3 7..
|CERNAN|Is that 5, Jack?
|SCHMITT|Yeap.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Why don't you put it up - well, you put the nomer away. Put it fairly near that (garble) there is some documentation there, I'll try to have the pan going while you're doing it. Okay, Houston, which way you going to drive out of here.
|CERNAN|I'm driving out of here -
|SCHMITT|Left or right?
|CERNAN|I've got to go right. I've got to go right.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Pin 1 is pulled and safe. Pin 2 is pulled - safe. Pin 3 is pulled and safe.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, and we'll talk to you in a minute back to the Rover, I guess is the best way. That doesn't look too hard, Gene, until just now.
|CERNAN|Thank you.
|SCHMITT|Oops, looks like you proved me wrong.
|SCHMITT|the first core was easy, the second one a little tougher and then it got tough down at the end. There, I'm getting a picture of you. Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I got it.
|CERNAN|You got it from' there, okay.
|SCHMITT|Yeah. Core but it wants to slide out. It's full. No rocks in it. It looks like just the same stuff we've been traveling through.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. I think you'd better help Gene with that - recovering that core there where the finger is going to fall out.
|SCHMITT|You know I think you're right and If you'll just wait until I finish the pan, that's exactly what I'm going to do.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I didn't know what you were doing.
|CERNAN|Bob, it's capped.
|CAPCOM|Got ya. Okay.
|CERNAN|Take the pole. Just hold the handle.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|I'll take this one.
|CERNAN|It's very - very loose soil, Jack and it - just any little movement and you'll lose some of it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:31 CST 168:38 GET MC683/2
168:38:00|CERNAN|Let me cap that end. Don't move It.
|SCHMITT|Uh Oh, you almost knocked some out. Get your - you know1where your thing is.
|CERNAN|Yeah, but I need you - that - that cap on you. The last one's gone off the rover.
|CERNAN|That's all right, I'll stay here. Go put yours out there.
|SCHMITT|I won't move it.
|CERNAN|Any little movement and that stuff starts -
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|Go - turn around, I'll get the rammer.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|Oh, man, even these pins are getting stiff.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob. The top rammed down - oh -almost half way without any effort.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Scoop's back on.
|CERNAN|The bottom rammed down about an inch.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Okay, Robert, let's see - turn around and I'll get this.
|SCHMITT|What was the last thing — let's see -we had to do?
|CERNAN|A couple of football size rocks. You got the DSBD?
|SCHMITT|I got it. I got the charge. You got the double core. I1got the double core. And I got one sample of a radial sample.
|CERNAN|(laughter)
|CAPCOM|We got a - that's a unique one.
|SCHMITT|In my pocket.
|CAPCOM|Have we got the gravimeter back on the rover?
|CERNAN|Yes, it's on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CERNAN|And we want to get a large block. Why don't we -
|CAPCOM|Okay and -
|CERNAN|Over here (garble) -
|CAPCOM|(garble) SESC from the shallow trench. We'd also like to have you moving in 4 minutes. That's with wheels rolling1in 4 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:31 CST 168:38 GET MC683/3
168:38:00|CERNAN|SESC, huh?
|CAPCOM|Roger, but we have to have the drill probe.
|CERNAN|I don't know if we can do that. We can t ry it.
|CAPCOM|We want the wheels rolling in 4 minutes. I don't think1it's practical at this time.
|CERNAN|Bob, we cannot get a SESC in four minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, cut it out.
|CERNAN|Let's roll.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|At this time.
|CERNAN|Now, I've got to push this latch on a -on a gate to get it locked - on a pallet to get it locked.
|SCHMITT|Need some help?
|CERNAN|Push the pallet while I trip the latch, will you? Wait till I trip the latch. So much dust in that core .
|SCHMITT|Get it?
|CERNAN|Nope, no, wait a minute. Open it up.
|CERNAN|Wait a minute.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|Now - now (garble).
|CERNAN|Trip it.
|CERNAN|Okay, try it.
|CERNAN|Lock?
|SCHMITT|Yep, yeah.
|CERNAN|Should be locked now.
|SCHMITT|that got it. That got it. Okay.
|CERNAN|Got a big rock there too.
|SCHMITT|Well, you know the thing that amazes me, is that there's no sub floor around here.
|CERNAN|I got one here.
|CERNAN|Okay, I'm about ready to clean up the rover here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 17. What's out there in the distance on a1hillside in a field in view of the camera? The camera is1pointing at It.
|CAPCOM|Oh, I'll bet that the -
|SCHMITT|It's out there at a distance.
|CERNAN|-
|CAPCOM|That's the flag, I bet, on the charge.
|CERNAN|Yeah, but it's only - you're looking right at it but it's only110 meters away.
|CAPCOM|Okay, It's hanging in front of the hills. That's the problem.
|CERNAN|You're looking right at the flag.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:31 CST 168:38 GET MC683/4
168:38:00|CAPCOM|Okay, it's hanging in front of the hills. We thought we had an artifact or something like that. Okay, p re ss on .
|SCHMITT|Bob, Bag 486 is a light colored rock taken about 3 meters to the right of the rover. It should be - you should be able to pick it out in that last pan. Unless the focus is bad.
|CERNAN|Bob, you got all your TG readings?
|CAPCOM|Roger, we've got that. We'd like to have you climb on.
|CERNAN|You want the LCRU off?
|CAPCOM|Roger, let's go to LCRU power off.
|CERNAN|Okay, Jack, let's -
|CERNAN|Better get going.
|SCHMITT|Yep.
|SCHMITT|You know I don't think there is any sub floor in here. The rocks are so dust covered it's hard to be sure but no rock I picked up looked like sub floor.
|SCHMITT|Get on there one time.
|CERNAN|I got three of them that time.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. Do you read me through the LM?
|CERNAN|Yeah, loud and clear.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Thank you.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 168:48 CST 2141 MC 684/1 (garble)
168:48:00|CAPCOM|Roger, thank you.
|CERNAN|I hope they came out. Okay.
|SCHMITT|I bet I twist it this time, if I can get off .
|CERNAN|Oh, let's see if old twinkletoes can do it. Jack, there's a big - a big one right there in my floor pan. That's one I did last time.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I'm on, strangely enough. Okay. Let's see. Okay,1the charge is off to the right. Yeah, you're all right. Are you this way or -
|CERNAN|I see it,
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|I bet you they thought there was some more orange bio over on the hills.
|PAO|EVA time 5 hours 16 minutes.
|SCHMITT|Move it a little bit.
|CERNAN|I don't know where we stand on time. Well, we've been out about 5 hours and 20 minutes or so.
|SCHMITT|Where are we headed, now that we are moving?
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|CERNAN|Well, I'm trying to get around, trying to get around a block field here, then I'll head back to the southwest.
|SCHMITT|Are we going to Sherlock at all, Bob?
|CAPCOM|No we're (garble).
|CERNAN|(garble).
|CAPCOM|And a reminder, Jack, we can get lots of photos, we've got1lots of film left right now.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And 17, Gene, I guess you're the one that took the SEP out,1if you could give me - do you remember the reading of the SEP temperature when you broke it down.
|CERNAN|Didn't even look, Bob. It was 125 when we started the station.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that.
|SCHMITT|that's Gatsby there, I guess huh?
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|It's not - it's not unlike Van Serg though.
|CERNAN|You know that looks like mantling,
|SCHMITT|Hopefully we can get a - watch your rock - there you go - we can get a shot looking back to the northwest
|CERNAN|Yeah, I'll get that when I -
|SCHMITT|into Gatsby because it looks like the mantle braids over the -the side from the southwest. Can you swing to the right, get1up a little closer to the rim, there?
|CERNAN|Hey here's a couple fragments in spots -
|SCHMITT|Look at that, see that?
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|See that structure -
|CERNAN|Yeah -
|SCHMITT|see how the - see how the mantle braids over
|CERNAN|Yeah -
|SCHMITT|from the northwest, can you get that?
|CERNAN|Yeah -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:41 CST 168:48 GET MC-684/2
168:48:00|SCHMITT|- and from the southwest.
|CERNAN|Got it?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, go ahead, keep going. Good shape, got it .
|PAO|Station 10 has been eliminated, the crew will head back toward the LM.
|SCHMITT|Bob, what I'm look at is the northwest portion of Gatsby where there's very very concentrated block field on the inner wall, except where there are on the southwest 3 streams and on the northwest and north a continuous stream, if you will, band, radial band, of mantle and is -appears to be burying that field, overlying and mantling the field.
|CERNAN|We got some pretty good pictures of it I th ink.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|PAO|Distance to the LM, 2.2 kilometers, estimated driving time 19 minutes.
|SCHMITT|One possibility I guess is that if it's a pyroclastic mantle, that in the lunar vacuum environment with whatever volatiles we're dealing with the stuff becomes extremely fine upon vesiculation. We may have been on it all the time and not known it; as far as recognizing it.
|CERNAN|As soon as we come through this draw smooth free of any debris or boulders it is on the other side of the upslope.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, watch it.
|CERNAN|Bob, do we have an extra EP?
|CAPCOM|No, we have 2 of them behind you. We're going to deploy - we're going to deploy I'll give you a reading soon on that.
|CERNAN|Okay - well one I deploy at the end I know, I thought we had an extra one here somewhere.
|CAPCOM|Okay - yeah that's right - okay that the one we were planning on deploying all along and it's there, we'll be deploying at a range of 0.1, which is just before you get to the SEP.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|I guess Sherlock's coming right over the top over here, I saw it when we were on that other ridge.
|CERNAN|Hey, you know, there's a lot of bad landing placed around here, that old Sun angle I think shows most of them up. Bob I -
|CAPCOM|And Geno we were look -
|CERNAN|I don't under -
|CAPCOM|at the map here -
|CERNAN|I don't under -
|CAPCOM|and if you keep going straight to the LM you're probably going to run into this crater area around San Luis Rey, you probably ought to head somewhat south of directly back to the LM, so we can at least tip the - the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:41 CST 168:48 GET MC-684/3
168:48:00|CAPCOM|western edge of Sherlock and then pick it up and then go from there back to the SEP, it looks like it might be rather rough there in that dotted line area if you can look at the backside of your map, Jack.
|CERNAN|Bob, I've already been doing it, I'm at 2441.7,
|CAPCOM|Copy that -
|CERNAN|Already been doing that -
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|CERNAN|And Bob, about 200 meters back, we crossed back into our standard mantle surface of about 1 percent fragment cover.
|CAPCOM|Okay 200 meter back -
|CERNAN|The block field which -
|SCHMITT|I can see the LM.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I can see the LM and there's Sherlock where those blocks are.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's the block field, the Sherlock block field, that's right. That is a block field.
|CERNAN|A big one there.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|Old Station 10, somebody even called it 10 Alpha in honor of the Apollo Program Office. The -
|CAPCOM|And Bravo -
|CERNAN|Apollo Spacecraft Program Office.
|CERNAN|Oh, that's right, 10 Bravo, I knew I'd never get that straight.
|CAPCOM|Do those blocks look like gabbro -
|CERNAN|How fast do you think we're going Jack, with out looking?
|SCHMITT|I think we're going about 18 clicks.
|CERNAN|Hey, you're just about right. Seems like the first time we've been able to go down hill. (laughter) not re ally.
|SCHMITT|Pull close to this big block if you can.
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|And I'll try to get a reading on what it is. I'll get pictures of it as we come up to it.
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Boy that's a big one. Watch it (garble) Looks like our old friend the subfloor, isn't it?
|CERNAN|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Vesicular sub-floor, vesicles are about centimeter maximum size that look like they're fairly evenly sorted and the rock itself seemed to be massif.
|CERNAN|2 50 1.4.
|CAPCOM|250 1.4.
|SCHMITT|Okay, we're back into a - we're back into a - about a 5 percent rock cover as we cross the edge of the Sherlock block field.
|CERNAN|That's Sherlock over that rim over there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 21:41 CST 168:48 GET MC-684/4
168:48:00|CERNAN|Yeah, yeah.
|SCHMITT|Once again, all these sub-floor blocks look as they're buried1Not mantle necessarily except maybe that one. Can you swing1right, just a tad?
|CERNAN|That one's got the mantle blowing up on it, isn't it ?
|SCHMITT|Yeah
|CERNAN|In it's fractures and everything.
|SCHMITT|that's the best example of that -
|CERNAN|Did you get a picture of that?
|SCHMITT|I got it, I got it.
|CERNAN|Got it, got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay and all those look like the same sub-floor gabbro?
|CERNAN|Yeah, that one's got the mantle -
|SCHMITT|Watch it .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 21:15 GET 168:58 685/1
168:58:00|CERNAN|Roger. Yes, everything in here so far Is the tan-gray subfloor gabbro that I've seen, I haven't — oh there's one over there that's the blue-gray, but blue-gray is not abundant.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CAPCOM|And 17, as you're getting closer, we're going to want1an LRV sample at 1.1, on the range.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|What are we now - 12.
|CERNAN|1.2. Okay, we'll try to get block and soil.
|CAPCOM|That'll be good.
|CERNAN|There's a fresh little pit.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I ' in continually impressed by the lack of exotic fragments in here.
|CERNAN|Hey, Jack. How about picking out there.
|SCHMITT|Okay, if you head into that little - well that's a1crater there -
|CERNAN|Let me get around it. We can go a little bit further.
|SCHMITT|I'll go open the platter -
|CERNAN|Yes, yes.
|SCHMITT|there are a lots of little fragments over there by that area - ha ha.
|CERNAN|Any time.
|SCHMITT|Okay, now swing a shallow turn. Oh. yeah -b e t te r ho Id.
|CERNAN|Did you get any of those?
|SCHMITT|Unfortunately, I can't see them.
|CERNAN|How about that one right in front of you, in front1of the television camera shadow. See that little one up1there? Right there.
|SCHMITT|It's real big, I think.
|CERNAN|Upper right, no upper right. Straight up the line16 H
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay, yes.
|CERNAN|If you can get over there I can -
|SCHMITT|I can get there.
|CERNAN|I guess I had the wrong - I guess I wasn't looking at the right one - the shadow is making it impossible to see down there1Now see what you can get. Bob, we're at 25.3 1.1.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|If we'do another sample, you're going to have to swing right so I can see - I can't see this way.
|CERNAN|Yes. And 53 Yankee.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. Is that soil or rock?
|SCHMITT|that's soil, I can't see to get a rock.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Go forward just a little bit, Gene.
|CERNAN|Okay. Bet you're going to get youself in a box there.
|SCHMITT|No, that's alright.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 21:51 GET 168:58 685/2
168:58:00|CERNAN|Oh, boy, sorry.
|SCHMITT|Oh.
|CERNAN|Get it?
|SCHMITT|I will. Got it.
|CERNAN|Can't see the LM anymore.
|CERNAN|Okay, the rock fragments, that's 54 Yankee.
|SCHMITT|Ohh1,
|CERNAN|Okay, you got a rock right in front of you don't you?
|SCHMITT|I see it. Rolled over.
|CERNAN|LMP brave - for that sample. Looks like abo ut 6 0.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.-
|SCHMITT|60, have I taken 60 pictures?
|SCHMITT|these rock fields are something else again.
|CERNAN|Yes, 60* Looks like some of our gray variety of subfloor up here - around the rim of that little crater.
|SCHMITT|You know, I'm starting to think that maybe the gray relatively nonvesicular subfloor may be^deeper fraction, based on what we saw - actually, though, let s s®e» that could have been overturn, I don't know, take that back. There just isn't much of it around here, although we saw a lot of it in the wall of Cochise.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we got that.
|CERNAN|What do you think this is, San Luis Rey .
|CERNAN|We're at 252 0.9 .
|SCHMITT|I wouldn't doubt it at all.
|CERNAN|I'll bet that's San Luis Rey.
|SCHMITT|Around the east side of it Mariner San Luis Rey. It's shallow filled with rock.
|CAPCOM|As close as we can tell, you're at one or the other of them.
|CERNAN|Boy, I tell you. Okay, we re at 250.y.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Mariner should look pretty fresh.
|SCHMITT|Boy, I certainly don't see much variety other than the gray and the tan subfloor variety. CE RN AN1Th ere's old Challenger, there she is. Pretty as a picture.
|SCHMITT|Boy, I tell you, there's no getting out of this stuff. You go from one to another.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|CERNAN|I don't know whether I said it or not
|CAPCOM|Gene, your range is 0.1, we're going to deploy the quarter pound charge, and that'll be Jack getting off to deploy like we talked about last night.
|CERNAN|Okay. That's EP 2, Jack.
|SCHMITT|EP2, right.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 21:51 GET 168:58 685/3
168:58:00|SCHMITT|Bob, we're still - we're moving in and out of areas of say 1 percent to 5 to 10 percent blockiness, and when it gets blocky - not only is it more blocky, but we seem to have more of the medium size craters in the range of 20 to 50 meter diameter craters. That may be Mariner right th e re .
|SCHMITT|How do you read, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, loud and clear.
|SCHMITT|Hey, that surge, let me mention again, was an unusual experience in the plains geology here.
|CERNAN|That must be part of San Luis Rey or Mariner - one.
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|It's pretty deep. Very deep.
|SCHMITT|Yes, it is .
|CERNAN|It's really big. We're at 252 and .6.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|the crater on our left - that is south of us is a large crater. It's somewhat deeper than craters of the same size that we've seen. And it too, though has -it's blocks - mainly - large blocks - mainly in the walls, although, there are blocks up here in the rim, occasionally up to 3 me te rs.
|SCHMITT|that string of blocks over there - that may be it.
|CERNAN|Yes.
|SCHMITT|that's an edge of a crater area.
|CERNAN|Want a picture of that?
|SCHMITT|Got it. Look at the way that thing's f rac tured.
|SCHMITT|Yes, this is the San Luis Rey, Luis complex, cause see how elongated it is?
|CERNAN|Yes. We're going to cut right through the western half here.
|SCHMITT|We're at 244.4.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Bob, I may have said early - early on up there at Van Serg that I saw subfloor, but we never did sample any that I know of, and the dust was picking up and I'm just not sure. Breccias were the most obvious thing there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, most interesting.
|SCHMITT|It might have been a window in the plains, here, of some kind, but it's strange to see it there with so much subfloor all around it that we saw.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 22:01 GET 169:08 MC-686/1

|SCHMITT|there she is.
|SCHMITT|All right.
|CERNAN|Okay and then I guess ah - then i'll head back to the LM I1don't go to the - unless you want to go to the ALSEP.
|SCHMITT|I think I'm going to.
|CERNAN|When I go to the ah - Oh you go to SEP.
|SCHMITT|that's right.
|CAPCOM|We're going to let you play the ALSEP game there Jack,1we've got a few things for you to do out there, when time comes.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|SCHMITT|.1 - no - We're almost to SEP. We're ab o u t -
|CAPCOM|Rog. We'll be just short of SEP.
|SCHMITT|- - 50 meters from SEP.
|CAPCOM|Is it short of the antenna?
|CAPCOM|Well, we'd like to have -
|SCHMITT|Well you see we get to the end of the antenna, -
|CAPCOM|No, no, don't - let's have it east to the antenna. If we are there let's deploy right where you are.
|SCHMITT|Okay, we're about 30 meters east of the antenna how's that?
|CAPCOM|That sounds great.
|SCHMITT|Okay, and we're at (garble) 221 and .2. It'11 be 221 and1.2.

|CERNAN|Hey, Jack, you're just going to walk back from here aren't you?
|SCHMITT|I can, yeah.
|CERNAN|Why don't you just go turn the SEP receiver off. we'did that the receiver's all done.
|SCHMITT|(garble) the transmitter - but you've got to come out here anyway.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I've got to come out here.
|SCHMITT|Forget it.
|CERNAN|I can do it.
|SCHMITT|No, we're just reading ahead, but no sense. Forget it.
|CERNAN|One thing I want - Okay, bend 1. Pulled and safe. Bend 2 pulled and safe. Bend 3 is pulled and safe.
|CAPCOM|Copy all those.
|CERNAN|And I'll try to put it into a depression. I'm going to put in a depression if you want. Okay. And then I've got to take a pan, huh. Will the locator — Yeah, how about a locator to the LM?
|CAPCOM|Be fine.
|CERNAN|You going to get on Jack, or walk back? Dealer's choice.
|SCHMITT|I'll get on.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay, locator to the LM. I'll give you a pan count if I can read it. Ah, 90 - 92.
|CAPCOM|Copy. 92.
|SCHMITT|You're going to have to left a little I guess.
|CERNAN|Go left?
|SCHMITT|to avoid the antenna.
|CERNAN|Oh, we - we'don't have to worry about it. But I will anyway.
|SCHMITT|Go ahead.
|SCHMITT|Here I'll take it easy. I'm sorry. SCHMIT1Okay. I want to point out a rock to you, I set up on end. We need to get into the bag - you can let me off there and I'll carry it. But drive close enough so I can reach down and use the focus for support.
|CERNAN|Where is it?
|SCHMITT|It's out over here. Between the -
|CERNAN|On which side of that antenna?
|SCHMITT|It's ah -
|CERNAN|Oh, there it is right there.
|SCHMITT|No it's out, it's on the - it's near the LM. Here -

169:08:00|SCHMITT|Oh, okay, I can go across this thing -I already did .
|CERNAN|That bag is empty, isn't it.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that's one I lost. I mean I dropped.
|CERNAN|Look like you got over.
|SCHMITT|Yeah - yep.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 22:08 CST 169:15 GET MC-687/1
169:15:00|SCHMITT|I think, it's that one there that's sort of dark .
|CERNAN|Up there, straight ahead?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|(garble) that must be it.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|That's it.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, can you swing over so I can lean on the rover (garble) that's good, no that's good, it's perfect. Okay got it?
|CERNAN|No, I'd hate to get run over this late in the game.
|SCHMITT|Well now what did I do that for?
|CERNAN|(laughter) what did you do, dig it under?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|SCHMITT|Need your oil changed?
|CERNAN|Yeah while you're under there would you check my transmission, please?
|CERNAN|(laughter) Any bubbles on the inside of the ti res ?
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|Haveyougotit?
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I got it. Hey Bob I got my rock, it's half way between the SEP and the LM. Wait, wait, let me put it in the big bag - in the big bag.
|CERNAN|Big bag.
|CAPCOM|Is it that brown one you saw before, Jack?
|CERNAN|Okay. Go ahead.
|SCHMITT|No it's a grey one.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, I just lost the sample, it's in my pocket I guess. Let me get some tongs.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|then you can go ahead. I'll walk by you.
|PAO|EVA time 5 hours 44 minutes.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, I'm back at the LM -
|CAPCOM|Roger, we have you back at the LM.
|CERNAN|- 151 4.0 and 001, well wait a minute.
|SCHMITT|Can you get it?
|CERNAN|I got to get your bag -
|SCHMITT|I got it, I got it.
|CERNAN|- let me get your bag off.
|CERNAN|I'm reading 80 on the amps, 78 on the amps, correction that's amp hours, voltage is 62 and 65. Battery 1 is 132, (garble) 0, motor temps are 200 and 210 on the rear 200 and 250 on the forward,
|CAPCOM|Okay we copy that. Okay, and let's - let me brief you here on the close-out tonight, 17. A number of things that we're going to do here that are slightly different. We've got some stuff for you over at the ALSEP, Jack, and I'll get with you when you go over there. Nothing we have to worry about in the meanwhile. When we unload the rover, we're
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 22:08 CST 169:15 GET MC-687/2
169:15:00|CAPCOM|going to take the SESC out and we want use that to collect the contaminated sample out behind the foot pad there as per planned and when we take the traverse gravimeter off, we're going to want to get both a grav and a bias reading, because the pallet was swinging in the breeze there. Otherwise, let's press on with the close-out and we'll get with you as times change.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, the core tubes are going in SCB 7, I mean - yeah 7.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that.
|CERNAN|You should have TV Bob.
|CAPCOM|Rog, we have TV thank you.
|CERNAN|Did you get my bag already?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|Jack?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|We only have one more to put in here, I'm just going to lay this over here.
|CERNAN|Yeah, the big one.
|SCHMITT|Man, there's some big ones in there too. We can get some of that sub-floor.
|CERNAN|Yeah, there's one in my foot pan too. Do you see it there?
|SCHMITT|We'll have to -
|CERNAN|Why don't you leave that go for a minute. Okay .
|CERNAN|What did you say a.bout the TGE , Bob?
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like to take TGE, of course, as we planned, take it off and we'll try to get both a grav and a bias reading. You might initiate one of them now, we'll initiate another one later on. We've got plenty of time while it's sitting on the ground there to do our thing with it.
|CERNAN|(garbled)
|CAPCOM|(garble) feedwater coming up pretty soon Gene.
|CERNAN|Bob, I already got it and I'm in AUTO, just about 30 seconds ago.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay, how are we fixed for samples? Here's 5 and it's about 1/2 to 3/4 full.
|SCHMITT|Well, let's dump -
|CERNAN|We've got to carry SESC up -
|SCHMITT|- let's dump these -
|CERNAN|We got 3 -
|SCHMITT|- got 3 in there, the rover samples.
|CERNAN|Okay. Okay. We probably ought to put the SESC in there, huh? If there's room for it.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, let's put the SESC -
|CERNAN|Where do you want the SESC, Bob?
|CAPCOM|Let's put the SESC some place where it's accessible to get that contamination sample, we probably want to - to get it before you go off to the ALSEP, but there's no
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 22:08 CST 169:15 GET MC-687/3
169:15:00|CAPCOM|real hurry on that, we'll see what works best , I ni not sure where the most convenient place for you to put it right off hand is.
|CERNAN|Why don't we get it now then can have -
|CAPCOM|right off hand.
|CERNAN|then we can have this bag -
|CAPCOM|That's probably -
|CERNAN|- let's get it now we can get the bag cleaned up -
|CAPCOM|Roger, there's probably not very many convenient places to put it, that sounds like a good idea to me.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me my scoop.
|CERNAN|Get your scoop, let's get it over with.
|SCHMITT|Say again Bob, you want that - I don't have a scoop, I don't even have a rake.
|CERNAN|They're both gone, huh?
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|Use your rover sampler.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|They both fell off when that thing opened.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
|CERNAN|Here's a full core tube we can't forget.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, that goes in the -
|CERNAN|(garble)
|SCHMITT|- yeah, why don't you get that scoop off and I'll put it over here in 4, I mean in 7.
|CERNAN|That's a good time to lose it, I'm glad we'didn't lose1it any other time, if we're gonna lose it, that couldn't have been more ideal.
|SCHMITT|Yeah.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/y3/72 CST 22:17 GET 169:24 MC-688/1
169:24:00|CHALLENGER|7.
|CERNAN|That's a good time to lose it, I'm glad we'didn't loose it any earlier. If we're going to loose it that couldn't have been more ideal.
|SCHMITT|Well, that was appropriate I guess.
|CERNAN|We got 2 - we've got 2 empty core tubes. Feel like we took a lot of them though.
|SCHMITT|We'll get it. We'll use them maybe back h ere.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we confirm that. Please go forward (garble) and don' t have to worry about bringing back, huh?
|CERNAN|Here's your thing.
|SCHMITT|Let ' s go.
|CERNAN|We need to get this SESC now and get it out of the way, Bob. CPAOOM1Roger. We agree with that.
|CERNAN|Okay. Minus Z here.
|SCHMITT|You want it in front of the minus Z foot pad?
|CAPCOM|Roger. Sort of underneath where you probably had the solar side of the cosmic ray experiment there. Between the SCS — between the foot pad and the ALSEP cores there.
|SCHMITT|(Garble)
|CERNAN|I've got about an inch to go.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|Give me it. Sew it up.
|CERNAN|That's good.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And both your feed waters are up, 17, so things look good.
|SCHMITT|thank you.
|CERNAN|Would you brush that white thing off for me.
|SCHMITT|Yeah, here let me get - there you got it.
|CERNAN|Okay. Take a couple over here.
|CERNAN|Let me go past the radar. Big job.
|SCHMITT|Bob, radar's built better. I'm on Frame 96, and the short can sample and (garble) sample is documented by 2 stereo pairs prior to that. And the before is cosmic ray pictures.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and which SCB is that going in, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Number 5.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, the SCB's - the SCB's at 5. That what you have.
|CERNAN|Yeah, short can's at 5. (garble) SCB.
|SCHMITT|Okay.

169:24:00|CAPCOM|Remember I want Inventories of the stuff that comes off the Rovar, And why don't you put it over there by the foot pad, so you can keep track of it.
|SCHMITT|Okay 5 I've got the big bag, bag 7, bag 5, bag 4 at the foot pad.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, we've also got SCB 3 with the (garble) samples in it on the Rover, if you have - if you have some of those today.
|SCHMITT|Noj we emptied those into 5.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. SCHliITT1Okay, Bcb. the gravimeter's on the surface ana you want a gravity read and a bias reading, is that correct?

And we're going to let you take the Commander's camera out to the ALSEP and get pnotos thar people think we need. And Gene's going to take your camera out and document the geophone when he deploys it. We will not deploy ic for the long term experiment however, and we 11 bring both back and carry them to the ETB when we get done .

|CERNAN|Came off, huh?
|SCHMITT|Yes.
|CERNAN|You don't have to get it around those hoses and everything?

|CAPCOM|It is almost (garble)
|CERNAN|Jack, what - wait a minute before you - Bob, are we going to need those other core tubes?
|CAPCOM|We'd like to have you leave 2 core tubes and the extension handle and the hammer and the core cap dispenser here. If we get back in time from doing all our appointed tasks at VIC site and at the ALSEP, we'll try and drive a double core here to end things up with a bang.
|CERNAN|Don' t leave it there.
|CERNAN|We'll play games with the extension handle, but that's alright.
|SCHMITT|Okay, let me set them over here. Where am I?
|CERNAN|Okay, big bag, all those -
|CAPCOM|17, did you guys leave your extension handles when that pallet came open?
|CERNAN|Yes, but we can - I can still drive a core with the hammer if we need to.
|CAPCOM|Okay,copy that.
|CERNAN|I think.
|CERNAN|Yes, one went with the ridge and one went with the scoop. Okay, Bob, as I read down that page it looks like we got it. The EPD check, I think we had 4 mags in there and a DSEA and the maps and the cosmic ray.
|CAPCOM|Roger. You've got 6 mags.
|SCHMITT|And I guess I'm ready to go to the - wait a minute, I want you to do some -
|CAPCOM|Okay, one -
|SCHMITT|6 mags is it?
|CAPCOM|One further question, did all the FSRs get off the Rover into the big bag?

|SCHMITT|Yes. Allright. Let me get it, so you won't get it too dirty.
|CERNAN|Okay. Very good. Here hold it. Got it?
|SCHMITT|Yes. How about over here.
|CERNAN|I'll put it over here against that background.
|CERNAN|Houston, before we close out our EVA, we understand that there are young people in Houston, today, who have been effectively touring our country. Young people from countries all ove the world, respectively touring our country, They had the opportunity to watch the launch of Apollo 17. Hope fully had an opportunity to meet some of our young people in our country, and we'd like to say first of all, welcome and we hope you enjoyed your stay. Second of all, I think, probably one of the most significant things we can think about, when we think about Apollo is that it has opened for us, for us being the Worlds a challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of that future lies in the young people, not just in America, but the young people all over the world. Learning to live and learning to work together. In order to remind all the peoples of the World, in so many countries throughout the world, that this is what we all are striving for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock, typical of what we have here in the valley of Taurus Littrow. It's a rock composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock of all sizes and shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even colors that have grown together to become a cohesive rock outlasting the nature of Space, sort of living together in a very coherent, very peaceful manner. When we return this rock or some of the others like to Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock with so many of the countries throughout the world. We hope that this will be a symbol of what our feelings are, what the feelings of the Apollo Program are and a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and harmony in the future.
|SCHMITT|A portion of a rock will be sent to representative agency or museum in each of the countries represented by the young people in Houston today, and we hope that they will, that rock and the students themselves will carry with them our good wishes , not only for the New Year coming up, but also for themselves, their countries, and all mankind in the future. Put that in the big bag, Geno. Big Bag.
|CERNAN|In the big bag. We salute you, promise of the future.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack and Gene, we thank you for your sentiments and your interests.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/12/72 GET 169:44 CST 22:36 MC690/2
169:44:00|CERNAN|And now, let me bring this camera around. To commemorate. Not just as Apollo 17's visit to the Valley of Taurus Littrow. But as everlasting commemoration of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the world. We'd like to uncover a plaque that has been on the leg of our spacecraft that we have climbed down many times over the last three days. I'll read what that plaque says to you. First of all, it has a picture of the World, Two pictures. One of the North America and one of South America. The other covers the other half of the World, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, it covers the North Pole and the South Pole. In between these two hemispheres, we have a pictorial view of the Moon. A pictorial view of where all the Apollo landings have been made. So that when this plaque is seen again by others who come, they will know where it all started. The words are "Here man completed his first exploration of the Moon December 1972 A. D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind. It's signed Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, Harrison H. Schmitt, and most prominently Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States of America. This is our commemoration that will be here until someone like us, until some of you who are out there, who are the promise of the future, come back to read it again. And to further the exploration and the meaning of Apollo.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. We, in Houston, copy that and echo your sentiments and Dr. Fletcher is here beside me. Like to say a word to the two of you. FLETCHER1Gene and Jack, I've been in close touch with the White House. And the President has been following closely your absolutely fascinating work up there. He'd like to wish you God's speed as you return to Earth and I'd like to personally second that. Congratulations. We'll see you in a few days. Over
|CERNAN|Thank you Dr. Fletcher. We appreciate your comments and we certainly appreciate those of the President. And whether it be civilian or military, I think Jack and I would both like to give our salute to America.
|SCHMITT|And, Dr. Fletcher, if I may, I'd like to re mind everybody, I'm sure of something they're aware, but this valley, this valley of history has seen mankind complete it's first evolutionary steps into the Universe. Leaving the Planet Earth and going forward into the Universe. I think no more significant contribution has Apollo made to history. It's not often that you can foretell history, but I think we can in this case. And I think everybody ought to feel very proud of that fact. Thank you very much. FLETCHER1I'll see you in a little bit.

|CAPCOM|Roger, we're through with it.
|CERNAN|Be kind, be kind. Well, I love it, and I'm sure I did a good j ob -
|CAPCOM|Well, we're not through with you, Gene, so don't throw yourself in the box.
|CERNAN|No sir, I just don't want to hit old Challenger there. That was unkind. You did the javelin -that was unkind.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene, at least -
|CERNAN|I didn't throw it as far as I could. I j ust -
|CAPCOM|We timed the parabola for that and have for one excellent measurement of g on the Moon now.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I didn't get you a pendulum but I don't know where I would, Bob. Okay, I'm going to have to take you out to the VIP site -
|CAPCOM|We're ready for that and we're -
|CERNAN|- you concur?
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Well, let me make sure I got everything. Okay .
|PAO|We won't have a picture while Gene Cernan drives the Rover to the VIP site, the very important place where the Rover will be left. He will turn the television back on after reaching that site.
|CERNAN|Read me through the LM.
|CAPCOM|Roger, read you through the LM. You guys both read me through the LM. (Playback)1Read you through the LM. You guys both read me through the LM.
|CERNAN|That's affirm. Okay, the first thing I want to do - tell John I'm going to do it exactly like he wants.
|SCHMITT|Okay. The camera is under the seat, I hope. Let me look. Yeah, camera's there.
|CERNAN|Jack, did you do something with the dust brush? It was under the seat, right?
|SCHMITT|It was, yeah.
|CERNAN|Yeah, I want to make sure it is because I'll need it -
|SCHMITT|Oh wait a minute, I don't know that it's there now.
|CERNAN|Well - I want to make sure I can get - get something to dust with.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Jack, as you go out to the ALSEP, let me tune in on your — (garble) about 3 hours worth of work out there preparing the ALSEP, alright? Over.
|SCHMITT|Okay, go ahead, I'm here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, number one, we want to retrieve the UHT and I quote tap sharply - that's sharply on the gimbal, which is the center section there with the little square metal piece in the middle. Tap sharply on the gimbal with the UHT and then reverify the level on the LSG. We'll check response here in Mission Control after you've done that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 169:52 CST 2245 MC 691/2
169:52:00|SCHMITT|You mean tap on the thing that swings?
|CAPCOM|That's what they say.
|SCHMITT|You always wanted to do that, didn't you?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's right.
|SCHMITT|Well, let me see if I can grab a clean UHT to do that.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, everything is zeroed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I'll be talking to Jack here, Gene, for awhile. You can interrupt the ribbon on this over -talking over me and I'll try to copy him.
|CERNAN|One comment. I got a flag on the other battery - 139 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SCHMITT|How much is sharply?
|CAPCOM|Sharply is sharply. It's probably not heavily but sharply. Fairly light, but sharply.
|SCHMITT|On the edge?
|CAPCOM|No, you see that little square metal piece - (garble) -
|SCHMITT|On the edge?
|CAPCOM|- you see that little square metal piece? You can just sort of rap on that -
|SCHMITT|Oh, yeah. Okay, here goes. I did it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And then it says -
|SCHMITT|You want me to do it again?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|that was sort of a moderate hard tap.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead and hit it harder (garble)-
|SCHMITT|It is level.
|CAPCOM|Hit it harder, please.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay? I can hit it harder yet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've observed something there. St and by.
|SCHMITT|Bob, you might be getting TV the way the antenna's oriented right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, go ahead. We'll do some more stuff here. In the meanwhile, while they're thinking about what's wrong with it, did you just tap it again?
|SCHMITT|No, I didn't touch it. I'm over at the central station now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, they're looking at it. Alright. Now, we want to take some photographs at the central station and a few selected - a few selected photographs of the ALSEP. Number one, we want a 7 foot cross-sun to the south of the ALSEP central station and then a 7 foot down-sun of the central station. Over.
|SCHMITT|A 7 foot cross-sun to the south.
|CAPCOM|That's what it says.
|SCHMITT|And then a down—sun.
|CAPCOM|Roger, a 7 foot down-sun.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 169:52 CST 22:45 MC 691/3
169:52:00|SCHMITT|You might tell me what they're trying to get with it. I might be able to help them.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I presume that what this means is looking to the south. It was cross-sun originally. I suspect that's what happened here, the way it was written up. So, it's a 7 foot looking at the - all the switches to make sure you guys turn them the right way, I suppose. And then a 7 foot looking down-sun, so that would be facing west, that side of it.
|SCHMITT|Okay, I got it. What else?
|CAPCOM|Okay. Now, there's a problem with the central station in which they think the south end is buried more deeply in the dirt than they had intended and the central station is, at the present time, getting very warm on the backside on the south side there which is - they believe you probably buried in the ground when you were trying to tilt it the proper alinement. They are requesting that when you're at the ALSEP you remove any soil buildup or debris with a convenient tool. They don't want you to touch it because it's fairly warm. But, if you have a UHT or something to move it — do you have a UHT with you or something with you that you can brush that soil aside with?
|SCHMITT|Yes sir.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You know the section -
|SCHMITT|It is piled up there - that's good (garble).
|CAPCOM|Yeah. Okay, they'd like that stuff brushed away. And you can give me a call -
|SCHMITT|Fortunately, I brought my handy-dandy Rover sampler out.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you can brush that aside and give me a call when you think that's cleared up the way it ought to be. That's probably one of those things we'didn't think about when we'decided to build the central station.
|SCHMITT|Well, you didn't - you couldn't anticipate the soil, Bob. Very soft.
|CERNAN|Bob, we are at VIP.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Ed Bendel is hard on my back to remind you that it's better to be too far away than too close.
|CERNAN|Alright. I thought I was but I think I may move just a little bit. Here's a little rise here I can give you. I think i'll give it to you.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SCHMITT|By the way, Bob, the soil gets more cohesive with depth. I hadn't really noticed that before.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|It's quite a bit more cohesive at the - feels about the same down to 3 centimeters out here, and then the cohesiveness goes up so it's difficult to scrape with the Rover sampler.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, Jack.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 22:54 CST 170:01 GET MC 692/1
170:01:00|CERNAN|, Well, I think you can see almost every thing from here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. And Jack, let me know when you get done scraping that soil away.
|SCHMITT|I will.-
|SCHMITT|And, now comes the hardest alignment of them all - but I can get it. Somewhere about there - see if I can't tweak it up for you - Bob, the east-west level bubble is not quite level. The north/south is. Do you want me to tweak that up?
|CAPCOM|Yes, you might tweak that up. We're get ting a good signal but go ahead and tweak it up just a little bit.- ,
|CAPCOM|And, Gene, what are you doing these days?
|CERNAN|I'm getting the high gain set up for you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, now you know why we'didn't make you a partner in that orientation all the time, don't you?
|SCHMITT|Boy, I'll tell you that was a piece of cake up until now.
|SCHMITT|there I got you.
|CERNAN|Bob, you're looking right down the center of my eye teeth. You -
|CAPCOM|Okay, -
|CERNAN|You've got TV.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we've gotten TV there Geno.
|CERNAN|You getting it?
|CAPCOM|We've got TV. _
|CERNAN|Let me take a look and clean things up.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I guess you can dust, and dust and dust some more for awhile.
|CERNAN|Let me get this dusting problem out of the way before I1do anything else.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CERNAN|You can look at your vantage point and if you don't1like it let me know.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll call Captain Video.
|SCHMITT|Bob -
|CAPCOM|Go -
|SCHMITT|How close can (garbled) be to the back plate of the ALSEP?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, I'll check.
|SCHMITT|It's about 30 centimeters away most of the place s now,
|CAPCOM|Okay, that sounds good. We'd like to return to the surface gravimeter, Jack. What you did had some effect but not a lasting effect and we'd like you to rap even more sharply, more strongly on the gimbal another three times. And we're again watching it and we'll let you know what to do. I'd like to tell you that this has all been done recently, this afternoon, up at Bendix on the qual unit and it survived it and so we are not in any real danger apparently of destroying it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 22:54 CST 170:01 GET MC692/2
170:01:00|SCHMITT|Okay. Three times, huh?
|CAPCOM|Rog, or up to three times.
|SCHMITT|Bob, don't let me forget to bring a dust brush back when I come.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll mark that down and remind you. And, Jack, you'll be glad to know that the temperature of the back plate there has already dropped 20 degrees.
|SCHMITT|Oh, beautiful. Bob, I don't think that bubble is working. How's your signal now?
|CAPCOM|Stand by and I'll check but why don't you to to the surface gravimeter?
|CERNAN|Bob, how's your TV lens? I don't have a lens brush. It looks good from here. I don't want to use this unless you think so.
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|SCHMITT|Rap three times.
|CAPCOM|Roger, get out of the way please, Jack and we'll take a look against some bright soil.
|CERNAN|What?
|SCHMITT|No, that's me he's talking to.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it looks pretty good, Gene. Go ahead.
|CERNAN|I don't want to use the lens brush.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, go ahead. It looks pretty good to us.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. Here come the raps. About three times. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. That's really fighting it pretty hard. We'd like you to put the UHV in the socket and rock it very firmly, don't pick it up but rock it very firmly from side to side in all four directions - about move the UHV about 6 inches in each direction while you're doing it.
|SCHMITT|Okay. - Okay, I rocked it. it's ringing.
|CAPCOM|Okay, is it ringing?
|SCHMITT|And the level bubble is better.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we understand. It's in good configu ration again as far as alignment and leveling is concerned, Jack. Let's go on and take some more ALSEP photos and let them think about it for a minute.
|SCHMITT|Okay, what do you want?
|CAPCOM|Okay. Next what we want is some Heat Flow - Okay, we just got late word they'd like to do it one more time and call it quit s.
|SCHMITT|the rocking bit, huh?
|CAPCOM|Roger, the rocking bit one more time.
|CERNAN|Bob, I may have moved the high gain. Do you see any change in signal?
|CAPCOM|St any by.
|CERNAN|If you're happy, I won't touch it.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob. It's rocked - the shadow - the shade is aligned to the sun now and it's level.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 22:54 CST 170:01 GET MC 692/3
170:01:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that and lets go get some ALSEP photos, Jack. I think you got some heat flow photos the other night besides the two pans. If you did, these may be redundant. They're - they want the cross-sun and down-sun of the east hole and cross-sun and down-sun of the west hole. And Ifm not sure whether you got those earlier. You said you got some extra heat flow - but - tell me if you did. They're both -all four of these are seven foot -
|SCHMITT|(garbled)
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 170:11 CST 23:05 MC 693/1
170:11:00|CERNAN|I'll get the heatflow pictures. They - one was 11 foot I think. And then the stereo pair there -
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I think all they're asking for is the two 7-foot stereo pairs.
|SCHMITT|Okay, that's one of them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, what they're asking for, Jack, is a 7 foot down-sun and a 7 foot cross-sun which isn't quite what we've been thinking in the past.
|SCHMITT|I'm getting the standard ones, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Okay, you got the standard documentation.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|SCHMITT|11 footers and 7 foot stereos.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead. They can't complain about that certainly.
|SCHMITT|Okay, now what?
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like a 3 foot shot of the lunar mass spectrometer including the orifice where the breakfield was. And Geno we are observing some degregation and would like to have the highgain -
|SCHMITT|Cross-Sun?
|CAPCOM|Yes, Jack, 3 foot cross-sun. And Gene, this is Houston, we'd like to get the high gain reoriented a little bit. We're observing some degregation in the picture.
|CERNAN|I'll tweak it. Okay, got it. Now what? L and S is complete.
|CAPCOM|Okay copy that. Now we want to go over the neutron flux, Jack.
|SCHMITT|Okay. How's the gravimeter doing?
|CAPCOM|We're looking at it, Jack. I'm not sure.
|CERNAN|Hey Bob, the panel you want covered - yeah, that's the panel. Okay. You want the panel with the - with the ON-OFF switch and the - and the signal switch and so forth covered don't you?
|CAPCOM|Roger, and be sure to get the thing to external before you cover it there, Gene.
|CERNAN|Okay, that was going to be a question of mine.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that goes to external.
|CERNAN|Okay, it's external.
|SCHMITT|What - what do you want me to do with the neutron flux?
|CAPCOM|Okay, we want the photograph facing south, for the 7 foot. So a 7 foot cross-sun essentially of the neutron flux in the soil.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Would you like to have the RTG in that p i cture ?
|CAPCOM|No. I suppose if you're generous - - you might take a partial pan around the RTG.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 170:11 CST 23:05 MC 693/2
170:11:00|SCHMITT|Well, it's just about in that direction. Okay, now what?
|CAPCOM|Okay, now let's remove - remove the neutron probe, probe experiment, from the ground and turn it off.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|No more on the gravimeter, huh?
|CAPCOM|No, the gravimeter is looking very bad still. And, Jack, you might notice when you withdraw (garbled) how difficult it is to withdraw it. Whether or not it's been seized by the soil collapsing around it or not. That's a soil mechanic study.
|SCHMITT|Not at all, not at all. It won't be I'll tell you. No problem.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|CERNAN|Okay, the high gain is - the high gain is tweaked .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll consider ourselves tweaked.
|CERNAN|And I'm giving the LCRU another zap here. Boy, I tell you, I ain't going to do much more dusting after I leave here. Ever.
|SCHMITT|Okay, upper probe is off. Mark it.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob. I'm going to put B and D OPEN and OFF circuit breaker bypass ON.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SCHMITT|And let me see -Bravo, Okay, and Delta, okay, Bravo and Delta upper probe is OFF. Mark it.
|CAPCOM|Is that upper or lower, Jack?
|SCHMITT|Up. Oh, lower, I'm sorry, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Power circuit breaker is ON, bypass ON. And the lower probe is capped -
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Gene you need to close that caution and warning flag. It's a heat thing when it's open I guess.
|CERNAN|Okay, it's closed.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|CERNAN|You want me to put a bag in front of that thing?
|CAPCOM|No, I don't think -
|CERNAN|Want me to put a bag in front of it in case it pops open again? I guess it won't.
|CAPCOM|No. I don1t think so. I can't imagine why it's really a problem anyway because we got the bypass on there and that heat's not going anywhere.
|SCHMITT|Okay, now the switch is OFF. Except my 15 volts. Bob, you want me away from the ALSEP now?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, Jack. I'll get one more word the- before we come back to the LM.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 170:11 CST 23:05 MC 693/3
170:11:00|CERNAN|Okay. Yeah, I got a camera, over there. - I'm going to look under the seats one more time. Nothing but a 500 -okay. Used tape -
|CAPCOM|Okay. Jack, we're ready to leave the AL SET.
|SCHMITT|Well, I hate to do that, Bob. I'm sorry about this gravimeter though.
|CAPCOM|Well, you're not the only one. The word is down here there's a whole room full of people that are sorry.
|PAO|EVA time 6 hours 46 minutes.
|CERNAN|Okay, I got the LMP' s camera, nothing in lu're, but couple of little bags, we used about all the bags we had, Jack. Not many here. Bob, I have the dust brush covered.
|CAPCOM|Copy the dust brush.
|CERNAN|Okay, let me get one parting shot - one of the finest running little machines I've ever had the pleasure to drive.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 23:14 GET 170:21 MC-694/1
170:21:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, some people down here are concerned about whether you've opened the battery covers or not.
|CERNAN|Yes sir, they're open.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy that.
|CERNAN|Ah, what a nice little machine. Parked on a little down slope, we've got the heading you want and I guess Ed's satisfied with the TV response, huh.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're satisfied with the TV, Gene. We're ready for you to take the EP number 3.
|CERNAN|Good old Mother Earth is right smack in the center. Bob, while we've got a quite moment here, as I go to deploy that EP charge, I'd just like to say that any part of Apollo 17 or any part of Apollo that has been a success thus far, is probably, for the most part, due to the thousands of people in the aerospace industry who have given a great deal besides dedication and besides effort and besides professionalism to make it all a reality and I would just like to thank them, because what we've done here and what has been done in the past, as a matter of fact, what has been done for 2 hundred years, you've got to contribute to the spirit of a group of people who form the aerospace industry. And I God bless you and thank you.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene, and we thank you guys.
|CERNAN|Ah, we're just 2 little - 2 little sets of twinkle toes here, there's a lot to getting this Rover running out here that we'don't have much to do with. Yeah, I guess there might be someone else that has something to do with it too, and I've been reading His signs, maybe not from Him directly, but His in Spirit, as we run up and down that ladder and that's God's speed, the crew of Apollo 17, and these listed, I'd like to thank Him too. 10 1 is p ulled.
|CAPCOM|Mark that.
|CERNAN|I meant the end of the Wolf step antenna, do you agree with that.
|CAPCOM|Roger, exactly right.
|CERNAN|Okay, 10 2 is pulled. Still stayed 10 3 is pulled and it still staged.
|CAPCOM|Copy that and -
|CERNAN|Don't know what I would do if it wasn't (laugh ter).
|CAPCOM|And now, also, do you have the SKP transmitter turned OFF there, Gene?
|CERNAN|No sir. Thank you - Okay, Bob -
|CAPCOM|Then we're ready for you guys to get back to the LM and dust it -
|CERNAN|- it's getting ready - it's getting ready Jacob to the ring, on the west end and I'm going to go back and turn the SEP off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and when that's done, Gene, we're ready for you and your dust brush to ease on back to the LM and dust each other and climb in.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 CST 23:14 GET 170:21 MC-694/2
170:21:00|CERNAN|You know what, Bob .
|CAPCOM|What, Gene.
|CERNAN|(garble) as the experience has been, I'd say we're probably both ready.
|SCHMITT|Oh, I don't know. Hey, Bob, 55 Yankee is an exotic looking rock I found about 5 meters south of the neutron flux hole, it's another grey, possible grey basalt, it's just that there aren't many of them around here and so I picked it up.
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|SCHMITT|Cheating a little again.
|CERNAN|Jack, you'll always be picking rocks.
|SCHMITT|Oh, I don't know.
|CERNAN|Okay, the transmitter is OFF.
|CAPCOM|Mark that.
|CERNAN|I don't blame you, there's so many interesting thing around here.
|SCHMITT|Just don't lose your brush, Gene.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, according to my inventory I'm going to return to the LM and the camera is going to the ETB.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. We'll have -
|CERNAN|And we're done with the TGE.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|We need a bias reading we want to use it again, Gene.
|CERNAN|Yeah, come to think of it, I - come to think of it, I guess you are aren't, you.
|CERNAN|Where are you, Jack?
|SCHMITT|I'm at the MESA.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|trying to snap a snap.
|CERNAN|I need a locater here to the LM.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and 17, we need you guys in the LM in one 5 minutes 15 minutes because of oxygen constraints.
|SCHMITT|Okay, Bob, my pictures are taken, I'm on the way. Oh, boy, where else could you do this.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 170:29 CST 2322 MC 695/1
170:29:00|CERNAN|If that had landed 30 meters back, Jack, we'd be pitched down15 degrees.
|SCHMITT|Right.
|CERNAN|Okay, what you're saying is I don't need my hammer any more.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we want you to dust and get in. We got one four minutes remaining before we need the hatch closed .
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, we'll - we're doing our best. Well (garble) on the hammer, but look at it, Jack. It's worn completely to a nub. It's off.
|SCHMITT|I guess that's alright - Look at - Here - my - I don't know where I am. Oh, boy, how about that? Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay, sir, you ready go on up?
|SCHMITT|Well, I will get this camera on. I got another batch of pictures - the LM and the flag.
|CERNAN|Well, watch this real quick -
|SCHMITT|Stereo, even.
|CERNAN|Jack -
|SCHMITT|Let me have your camera. Go ahead.
|CERNAN|Oh yeah, pull it away. Let me throw the hammer. Okay? Let me throw the hammer - please.
|CERNAN|It's all yours - you've got the - you de s e rve it -
|CERNAN|A hammer thrower - you're a geologist. You ought to be able to throw it. You ready? You ready for this? Ready for this?
|CERNAN|Yeah. Don't hit the LM or the ALSEP.
|SCHMITT|Look at that, look at that, look at that.
|CERNAN|Beautiful.
|SCHMITT|Look like it was going a million miles, but it really didn't.
|CERNAN|Didn't it? Okay, here, this is an ETB.
|SCHMITT|Let me - let me make sure that that's all cin che d up .
|CERNAN|Okay. And then start on up. We got to get going here.
|SCHMITT|Unfortunately, their little plan didn't count for the fact that it's hard to pack the HTB with the film magazine s in1it.
|CERNAN|And I'll try and get the big bag here cinched up .
|SCHMITT|that is a major task.
|CERNAN|Yeah, that's going to be - oh, is it heavy. Is it heavy1Something in that core tube you put in there?
|SCHMITT|Yes sir. Don't tell anybody though because they'll get mad at me.
|CERNAN|Oh, man, is that heavy. Holy smoly.
|SCHMITT|252. That's about three quarters of a core, hand pushed half a meter inside the +Y footpad.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/13/72 GET 170:29 CST 2322 MC 695/2
170:29:00|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Copy that.
|CERNAN|Okay, Jack, how's that ETB coming so we can get going?
|SCHMITT|Fine. I've got to put it on a strap, though.
|CERNAN|I can get that. This is all cinched up. I think it'll hold.
|SCHMITT|Why don't you start on up and I'll start dusting you.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|Very good. Anything fall out?
|SCHMITT|Nope.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Let me dust you - set that down and I'll (garble)
|CERNAN|You'll have to hand stuff in -
|CAPCOM|Okay, and 17, - a reminder we need you inside in 10 minutes.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob.
|PAO|EVA time 7 hours.
|SCHMITT|I'm going to do a lot of jumping. I'll be there in a minute.
|CERNAN|(garble) back. It's clean.
|SCHMITT|I'll get the legs as best I can.
|CERNAN|I want you to get me here before you do that.
|SCHMITT|Okay. And while I'm doing that, will you (garble) okay?
|CERNAN|Okay.
|SCHMITT|Boy, you got dirty today. I think we're just going to have to live with it.
|CERNAN|Get my top. I can kick a lot of that stuff off my legs. How do I look in back?
|SCHMITT|terrible. You're going to have to - your legs are really filthy. Not much I can do about it.
|CERNAN|Okay, I'll get them off. Why don't you start packing -
|SCHMITT|Kick them against each other and it will c one off.
|CERNAN|Okay. Put it on up.
|SCHMITT|You might shake the bag.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And don't forget your equipment.
|SCHMITT|Nope.
|CERNAN|Do what?

|CERNAN|There, I'll stand - I can hand it to you.
|SCHMITT|It never had a very good closure on it, but it can be closed.
|CERNAN|I had it over - over the top. The latch was closed -
|SCHMITT|Ah, it won't hold with all that weight in the re .
|CERNAN|Okay, I got your antenna. Let me get a high -
|SCHMITT|Got to close this - you don't want that in your way.
|CERNAN|I can't close it.
|SCHMITT|Oh, okay.
|CERNAN|You might try.
|SCHMITT|Get all your flaps? Okay, hold your head down .
|CERNAN|Yow.
|SCHMITT|Won't go, huh?
|CERNAN|Nope. Will that bother you getting in?
|SCHMITT|I can probably make it.
|CERNAN|Get on up.
|SCHMITT|Oops, try that again. Okay, why don't you hand me the neutron flux and I'll put it -
|CERNAN|Okay, neutron flux.
|SCHMITT|- on the platform. Okay.
|CERNAN|Why don't you start on in and I'll get some of these bags out of the way?
|CERNAN|Well, I just - you don't want to hand them to me up here?
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, for your thoughts, we've agreed that you can delete the tracking light. We'd like to get you guys in as soon as possible, 7 minutes now, and we'll delete the tracking light test.
|SCHMITT|Okay. Okay.
|CERNAN|Okay, that's all I can handle up here. One more and I can put it up here. Watch the cover on this one.
|SCHMITT|Got it?
|CERNAN|Got it. Stand it up because the cover won't h ack it.
|SCHMITT|Okay.
|CERNAN|If you get on in, I'll come up to the porch.
|SCHMITT|Where's that EVA pallet that's always in my way?
|CAPCOM|I don't think we're going to have one of those tomorrow, Jack, so we. did away with that. We hope we re not going to have one of those tomorrow.

|CERNAN|Your words are well taken.
|SCHMITT|You know how I feel.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Gene and Ron, this is the CSM CAPCOM. Thought you might be interested your buddie up above you there is chugging around and about ready to bed down himself right now and he did take a good look at the landing site through binoculars tonight and took a good look at Shorty crater there and noticed quite a lot of variations in color - that may be the same color changes you saw in that orange soil and that but we're trying to match it all up in Farouk and Ron are working it out. We're trying to match it all up and see if we can get a comparison there.
|CERNAN|Excellent. Tell him we'll see him tomorrow.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, he's counting on it.
|CERNAN|How's American looking to you, Bob?
|CAPCOM|I'll give an update. It's working perfect. No problems at all and we got good SIM bay data on everything. The UV, the IR the lunar sounder and everything that we -every data point that you see is just great. It's - it's just hardly any anomalies at all. Everything is just wonderful.
|CERNAN|Outstanding.
|CAPCOM|Gene about this total limit of any problem there is and it's not a problem is we're just having to stir those H2 tanks manually because of that limiting cycle on the pressure switch there. We could go back to auto but it's easier to go manual.
|CERNAN|I'll be back up there tomorrow and I'll stir them for you.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|And Jack and Gene, let me make a note here for you guys. There will be a series of references to this around the checklist but it's a general thing and you might even put a piece of tape across it if you want to or something - rather than go through and call at all the locations. We'll leave press REG A closed for the rest of the time. Might keep that in mind.
|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, we'll - I think we'll handle that one okay.
|CAPCOM|Gene, one thing you may be interested in as the commander. We're going to have to do two burns tomorrow on America. The orbit - the mascons didn't deteriorate the orbit as much as everybody thought it was so there's going to be and RCS burn about an hour prior to the - to the LOPC burn.
|CERNAN|That's interesting, Bob. Are you going to do DOI 3, huh?
|CAPCOM|Well, yeah, I guess that's what it'll be - it's going to be an RCS burn at about 11 foot per second it'll drop the - it'll circulize the orbit and then we'll do the plane change burn.

Okay it's going CLOSED. CLOSED. Okay, pressure reg, A, let's leave A OFF, and pressure reg B to direct 02 (garble) 40, and then go to egress, and we'll check our decay. Okay, go on to - Wait a minute I think I should have went on to (garble) yeah. Okay, it's unlocked. Okay. Three ready for 2 Check. How high do they want suit. 37 to 40 cup gage. Okay. It's warming up slowly. Yeah, it's getting somewhat warmer. Off the peg, bat off the peg. Okay, coming up on 35 okay, when you hit 37, I'll be with you so you can - Okay 37. Okay MARK it 1 minute. Okay. You did go egress, right? Yep. Okay.

|CHALLENGER|Hope so, breath.
|CHALLENGER|There.
|CHALLENGER|Get it.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, we've got another 15 seconds to go.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, MARK it, one minute you go to circuit relief auto.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, watch your ears.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|There.
|CAPCOM|And 17, we're watching you and you look good to us. You're GO.
|CHALLENGER|Okay,
|CHALLENGER|I had about 2/10ths.
|CHALLENGER|And I had 2/10ths. 37 to 35.
|CHALLENGER|Hey let's make sure we got everything. You want to 40 then you went to EGRESS then we monitor suit circuit relief auto, pressure is decay at 48. Okay, that's good. Okay, we're GO for cabin depress.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Roger, you're GO for -
|CHALLENGER|Okay, 16 to ECS cabin repress open.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, repress coming open. Circuit breaker's open.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. (garble) I think I'll get this down here.
|CHALLENGER|They want this left in auto?
|CHALLENGER|Huh?
|CHALLENGER|Leave this in auto?
|CHALLENGER|What, is all you want is 16 cabin repress open .
|CHALLENGER|circuit breaker
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Overhead to forward dump valve open and in auto at 35. Get that one down there now.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you ready?-
|CHALLENGER|Okay, go ahead. I'll give you a call at 35.-
|CHALLENGER|Circuit release was auto, right?
|CHALLENGER|Yep. Had to be.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, going open.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, coming down. I want your auto at 35, I give you a call my (garble) suit is going up. MARK it. Okay, you're 35. Verify cabin 35 and latitude circuit locked up at 43 and decaying. It's about 46 and decaying, How's it look to you, Houston.

|CHALLENGER|Okay, hatch opening. Downward.
|CHALLENGER|When I get the hatch partially opened, you can go to auto1on that valve.
|CHALLENGER|Still no good words about the gravimeter, huh, Bob?
|CAPCOM|No, there's an outside chance that it's been a little cold. And they're hoping that if it warms up, that it may take care of itself but, no, everybody's very sad about that.
|CHALLENGER|Well, I could have sprinkled dirt on it mayb e.
|CHALLENGER|Let me (garble) to the hatch, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|StilL about .2.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, want to set it in auto.
|CHALLENGER|I can get it from here.

|CHALLENGER|Okay. Okay.
|CHALLENGER|(Garble) not out there, can I have it in the light weight PLSS's.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Here goes the old - whose PLSS is this now?
|CHALLENGER|Well, look at it, if you want a memory. That must be yours1it's red. No, that's mine, no it's yours. There goes the old1Commander's PLSS.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, baby thanks for doing a good job. And that was a backup PLSS too.
|CHALLENGER|Well, that wasn't very good.
|CHALLENGER|It walked down the ladder.
|CHALLENGER|It went down as gracefully as you did.
|CHALLENGER|Look at that. Okay, what's next.

|CHALLENGER|I jettisoned mine.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.

|CHALLENGER|No wait.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, is there something else?
|CHALLENGER|Watch it. Take this I'll get it.

|CHALLENGER|Speaking of suits. These things perforin super.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and we can get our helmets off.
|CHALLENGER|If I can ever get unsuited.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, this is funny. Yeah - yeah There's my hand. Now let me try the other one.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, let me get it for you. I can free yours - another -
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, but I (laughter).
|CHALLENGER|There.
|CHALLENGER|The right one went easy -
|CHALLENGER|I think they're all really getting -
|CHALLENGER|Oh, and the helmet is off and I'm throwing it in the GARBLE.
|CHALLENGER|Well, there's no changing in our minds now, the PLSSes are going to be hard to retrieve. But you could if you had to, though.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. From the old back up crew that followed you every step of the way super job on EVA you guys.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you John. Appreciate the words Jose, but we also appreciate you're helping us get it this far.
|CAPCOM|Rog, Neil.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, you know in all those things you tell people - was that Charlie? I haven't heard your voice since — you know all those good things you tell us about dust and all those other things, you know, you believe them all just like everybody else does - but you've just got to come out here and experience it for yourself to really be a believer.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, well I take it all back about it all looks the same.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, it really doesn't Charlie, but all those physical things you get handicapped with - there's a lot of easy things as far as l/6g - but all those other things - you know there's nothing like doing it to be a believer.
|CAPCOM|Well, you guys did it great.
|CHALLENGER|Charlie it may all look the same but Taurus Littrow, mark my words, has some variety.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we could tell that, Jack. Great job.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you, Charlie and thank you for all the help.

171:59:00|CHALLENGER|Hey, Charlie I remember a long time ago when I said something about being down among them. I didn't know what it was until we got here.
|CAPCOM|Challenger we have a good word from the old program managers even though you guys were pretty picky there in bringing rocks back, we're going to let you keep them all. You only busted the red line by 40 pounds.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, he's a pretty good guy any way.
|CAPCOM|That assumes your good buddy up stairs gets a good plane change tomorrow.
|CHALLENGER|Oh, he will and I tell you Gene and I both have lost 20 pounds apiece on this mission.
|CAPCOM|We can believe that.
|CHALLENGER|Stand by (garble).
|CHALLENGER|Dave, we're on VOX anyway - let's go to ICSP,
|CAPCOM|It's safer that way.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, specially when you don't know you're talking.

|CAPCOM|Hey, Jack, Houston. Are you busy?
|CHALLENGER|Say again, Ken.
|CAPCOM|Are you busy? I'm sitting here looking at a couple of questions that they wanted to ask, and whenever it's convenient for you — I'm not sure just how busy you are right now, and just keep in mind I've got a few questions to ask you on the traverses and give me a call when you're ready to talk about It.

|CHALLENGER|Okay, stand by. Is that what you wanted.
|CAPCOM|Na, we can't watch it Jack, if you just tell us if you've got it into POO and back in the P06.
|CHALLENGER|That's what happened.
|CHALLENGER|I thought you watched it the other night.

We're about an hour and a half behind the time line and we're going to make up no more than an hour of that.
|CERNAN|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Now, I think -
|CERNAN|Okay, Ken, we're cutting into the chow and go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, uh - would you like for me to just read you all the questions and let you mull those over before you work on it or do you want to do one at a time .
|SCHMITT|One at a time is better, Ken.
|CAPCOM|All right, sir. Number 1 wanted to know if the blue grey rocks at station 6 are similar to those at station 2.
|SCHMITT|Ken, I think they are but I think you'll find that the ones at station 6 are much more metamorphic rock or recrystallized rock than the ones we had at station 2. I had the impression that the ones we were sampling at station 6 were really inclusions in the anorthositic gabbro and had been probably considerably metamorphosed by it being included in it. Whereas the ones we had at station 2 were a seperate rock type apparently, as I recall it, anyway.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's good.
|SCHMITT|Ken, let me just say that I - my impression is that there was a lot more action in the rocks at station 6 than at 2. I saw a lot more, a lot more was evident, the inclussions, some of the patterns, some of the other things we saw.
|CAPCOM|All right, sir. Let's go on the second one and it said, do we understand that there were no breccias at station 8.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 173:33 CST 2:26 MC 707/1
173:33:00|CHALLENGER|- in the one that pyroxene plagioclase rock, was a breccia in the sense it was fractured, it was ejected by dark glass, but it would be what we would call a mosaic breccia, in that respect 1 think. And not the - didn't see any station 6 or station 2 type breccias there at all. Other than the subfloor gabbro that pyroxene plagioclase rock was the only major rock type I think we saw. Unless we picked something up in the rake s ample1.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Okay, third one says what are your impression of the distribution of the familiar subfloor gabbros throughout the EVA-3 traverse?
|CHALLENGER|Well, I don't know - I think we'discussed that a little bit on the traverse - quite a bit as a matter of fact. The impression I had was that most of the traverse on the plains with the one exception of - of Van Serg Crater were - we were in box fields or fragment fields that were almost — well, were dominately sub floor and visually from the Rover, I had no impression of any other significant rock type with the exception of a occational blocks of the gray variety of the subfloor gabbro. And I don't - Gene - 1 don't know Gene's impression was, he was driving a lot but pass it on. I think - well actually commented (garbled) coming back out of station 6 and 7 and then back off at - coming back down at 8 how the terrain features changed, I think that was due principally to the — to the what we've been calling the subfloor material evident, and there again it was what I would say particularly mantle filleted much like we have here where the LM is with the exception of Van Serg where we actually saw fragmental boulders for the most part a lot less buried, sitting on the surface.
|CAPCOM|All right sir. At Van Serg some rocks were described as gray breccias and some contained light fragments. Was there a variety of breccia present?
|CHALLENGER|I think - I think not Ken. My impression was that there was a variety only in their - in the degree to which they were fractured. We found and sampled I think the two major — one extreme - extremely fractured rock that I said was pliable in any way it broke into small pieces very easily with a hammer or in you hand if you worked at it. And the other was breccia that was not - was much more cohesive than that. It was not fractured or pliable at all but they both were on the rim and I think they were just varieties of probably shock f ractury.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Could the Van Serg breccias correlate with the blue gray material at Cochise?
|CHALLENGER|That's possible I guess. But my first guess would be that the blue gray at Cochise was blue gray subfloor and well I don't know, that's a good question. That's a good question. We - maybe with the pictures we have we can work out the an attitude - approximate attitude on that contact that I
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 173:33 CST 2:26 MC 707/2
173:33:00|CHALLENGER|talked about on Cochise and see if it would project over reasonably to Van Serg. I wouldn't be surprised if it would. That's a good - that's a good point. To me they look ve ry s imilar.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And you guys sure -
|CHALLENGER|But - but - Ken, Ken, Ken -
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, we're eating. We're fixing and eating at the same time.
|CAPCOM|Getting mighty efficient. Go ahead. You're starting to say something.
|CHALLENGER|You just - Ken, I think from a distance we saw the blue gray in Cochise. You couldn't make a definate correlation. But it's a good idea and ought to be considered as one of the possibilities. The other is that we just had a window in the subfloor that coincidentally - I mean what's underneath the subfloor might be that breccia. Coincidentally - the Van Serg impact hit that window.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You all were saying about the (garbled) of Van Serg was at a class in the breccia.
|CHALLENGER|Negative, it was a - excuse me, I have my mouth full .
|CAPCOM|It's about time.
|CHALLENGER|It was an ag - aggregate irregular looked like a glutenated glass in fragments just sitting on the rim of Van Serg. And the reason I said I thought it was in place or has fallen there and crystallizde there is that there were 4 or 5 similar fragments arranged in a small coherant area. Not making that very clear I don't think, but it looks as if it hit and broke apart upon hitting a little bit but didn't really splatter or — or break apart in any significant matter.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|CHALLENGER|There are - similar things I tell you what it looks like, if anybody 1d walked up the rim of Kilowayekee, in the ash out there and on top of the ash there are bombs that were fairly clearly molten when they hit and they just enough spring to break and when they hit - but they - the individual pieces didn't move very far at all. And you can see that pattern on Kilauea-iki. And it was the same kind of thing except that there was no directional aspect of it here.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|And that's not to say it's volcanic glass. That's just the kind of pattern it was.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Can you tell us if the dark material in the bottom of Van Serg was similar to the collected rim material.
|CHALLENGER|I think so except that as Gene pointed out the glass was coarser. Was coarser in the bottom than what anything we saw in the rim.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 173:33 CST 2:26 MC 707/3
173:33:00|CAPCOM|Okay. Are there any distinctive features other than color to separate tan from blue gray breccias? Such as joining or massive nature or continunity, anything of that na ture.
|CHALLENGER|We're - where did we find those tan breccias?
|CAPCOM|Challenger, this is Bob, I think we were talking about some of them I think at station 1 the first night. We had both (garbled) didn1 t we have two of those in the same rock together?
|CHALLENGER|They were both gabbros.
|CAPCOM|Jack, excuse me -
|CHALLENGER|Tan gabbros and blue gray gabbros.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Okay, yesterday, excuse me I wasn't reading the question. Okay, the breccias - they were tan and blue gray breccias yesterday at station 2 were there not? You have the 2 types of breccias at station 2.
|CHALLENGER|Well, yeah. Yeah, that's right. And now as I think back I guess that's the main difference between the tan rocks at station 2 and station 6, but the ones at 6 appear to be having a igneous texture or at least a very crystalline texture and inclusion like masses of other rocks whereas the ones at station 2 had - they seem to be fragment breccias, as I re call.

173:42:00|CHALLENGER|- and the ones at station 2 they seemed to be fragment breccias as I recall. That's right, although they may have been re crystallized or metamorphosed, they were clearly breccias at station 2. I just forgot about that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Okay, and can you amplify your description going out to station 6. In particular were there blue-grey and tan-grey bands on the North Massif?
|CHALLENGER|Rather than bands, there were lines that appeared to be the upper terminus of the — of the source of the boulders that were strewn below that line. And those lines tended to be either - show a blue-grey source or a tan-grey source, as you will, (garble).
|CHALLENGER|Oh, those up banks.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, if you think you're talking to us, you're breaking up badly.
|CHALLENGER|I just thought you might be interested, we just had a little spurt of dust come up by the window.
|CAPCOM|Was there a sleigh with it?
|CHALLENGER|Wise guy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, did you see very much of dust, or was it just one little shot?
|CHALLENGER|Can I - one little shot, it was actually just particles. Something we threw out must have popped.
|CAPCOM|Okay, do you have any preliminary strati- graphic sequence for the plains?
|CHALLENGER|For the plains, huh? Well, my guess would be that the Van Serg breccias were the oldest rock. The gabbro sub-floor gabbro's the next oldest and the mantling material is the youngest. But that's - the only good clear relationship was mantle on top of the sub-floor gabbros. I - we really don't have a good relationship of the breccias and I just — I guess I lean towards thinking that that Van Serg was a window in the sub-floor rather than being a bed of some kind, on top of the s ub-f1oor.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and do you have an opinion on what underlies the Sculptured Hills?
|CHALLENGER|Well, I think we've been to - the rake sample is probably going to tell the tale there. My guess is from the boulder - boulders and sub-floor around up there that are of gabbro and maybe the Sculptured Hills are a version of the sub-floor rock. I don't think that the orthopyroxene anorthosite rock was necessarily indigenous to the Sculptured Hills. It was glass coated and permeated by glass so I suspect it may have been thrown there by an impact somewhere else.
|CAPCOM|All right sir, we've got one last thing for you to clean up. Back on page 76 of your checklist, it looks like we may have skipped some steps on the gas return valve, and like to make sure that you get to AUTO and the gas diverter pushed tc CABIN before you stow the oxygen hoses.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ken, we got cabin gas return AUTO.
|CAPCOM|Okay, understand AUTO and you got the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 02:35 CST 173:42 GET MC-708/2
173:42:00|CAPCOM|select to CABIN?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah I got diverter pushed to CABIN and we're trying the PGAs now.
|CAPCOM|All right sir.
|CHALLENGER|And I guess if - if you could go in - my feeling is if you go to the bottom of every one of those large craters like Camelot, you could examine some of these fragments on the walls and down there near the bottom, I just get a feeling you'd find this - this blue-grey breccia down the re.
|CAPCOM|All right sir.
|CHALLENGER|I mean in all the big craters like Camelot. Well we - I think maybe that's true, however, we'did not see isolated fragments of it very often, if at all, out here on the , the plains themselves, away from the craters. So if the blue-grey breccia does - the Van Serg breccia does underlie the sub-floor, the craters are not - it's far enough that the craters we have apparently have not penetrated and brought up much of that kind of material. Well that's it.
|CAPCOM|Okay guys, it's time to press on and finish up chow time and I've got your stowage summaries whenever you're ready for that, to get started on.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ken let us finish eating, then we'll go back to work.
|CAPCOM|Okay, give me a call when you're ready.
|CHALLENGER|I'll help you in just a second (cuts out).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 02:47CST 173:54GET 709/1
173:54:00|CHALLENGER|Okay. Okay. Ken I'd like to go ahead and hear your recommendations on Taurus and I'll write it down.
|CAPCOM|Roger, page 2-2. I've got some numbers to fill in at the bottom under the collection bag stowage.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I've got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, number 1 with the aft engine cover is bag 8. And then the second line it's bag seven. The third line it's bag six left hand and five right hand. And the last line is bag 2 and 4. And you can disregard the max weights.
|CHALLENGER|Okay just so we got it straight after the engine cover bag 8. Left hand side bag 7. Left hand plus the right hand side, number 6 left hand and five right and the ISA bags 2 and 4.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Jack, the people down here watching things noticed that your suit ISO valve is still in disconnect if you're trying to dry the suit out you might check that. It's your option what you want to do with it.
|CHALLENGER|I'm glad somebody is watching things. Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Ken we're in the process of getting all these bags in the proper places now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 03:16CST 174:24GET 710/1
174:24:00|CHALLENGER|Ken, this is Jack, why don't you make a note that bag Bravo is empty with miscellaneous photos since the last report on it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|And, Ken, we're stowing Mag Nancy at a reading 153.
|CAPCOM|Okay, CDpy 153.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Geno.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ken we're - all we've got left to stow now is the buddy PLSS bag and that's in work. And we got all the ETB stuff taken care of. All the other bags are stowed per your recommendation. We'll be configuring these pads for sleep and putting up the hammock here shortly and as soonas we can get cleaned up personally a little bit we'll be in the sack.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds great.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Geno, GARBLE they're looking at that buddy PLSS bag and suggested ya'11 make sure that you're going to have room to do the equipment jettison and get the hatch open and all that. They had planned on stowing it the next day.
|CHALLENGER|That's a good thought, Ken. Thank you, Ed. The fact is that probably may think more convenient - we were going to be sm art and get ahead here but thank you.
|CAPCOM|The faster I run, the behinder I get.
|CHALLENGER|I keep forgetting these checklists have been exercised a hundred thousand times.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we keep remembering that.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. If you'll just give us a call when you're ready to sack out we won't bother you and just that way we can keep track of what you're doing and you're about ready to go to bed and we'll get you up at an appropriate time.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ken, this is Jack. I guess I have the duty BIOMED tonight so I'll give you a call when we're turning out the lights.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|And it won't be too long.
|CAPCOM|All right. You guys are doing pretty good, you're almost caught up.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Ken, working through this thing we haven't been able to find instructions for the stowage of the EV gloves. Do your friends back there have an recommendations?
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by one and I'll check on that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we can stick those things on the COMM panel for now and then tomorrow on page 7-14 it's going to have you stow them in the LEVA bags but for the time being if you just stick those up on the panel, set them aside - you'll use them tomorrow.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 03:16CST 174:24GET 710/2
174:24:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ken got you. Yeah, they're going to get the inside of the LEVA pretty dirty.
|CAPCOM|Well, from what we've seen, Jack. I think everything's going to be about the same color by the time you get th rough.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, it didn't bother your EVA did it Ken to have a little dust in your helmet?
|CAPCOM|No, no - that's kind of nice to have.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, an experienced fellow like you might have a recommendation on how to get my visor up.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, give it to the CMP.
|CAPCOM|We were just debating down here how come you guys threw away those nice clean gloves and kept the dirty ones.
|CHALLENGER|I wish you hadn't ask that Pete. We were just debating that too.
|CAPCOM|How long are your arms, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|You do all sorts of things.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, they're out on the porch as a matter of fact. That's not too far fetched. I guess there's some old friends you just hate to get rid of, Pete.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that figures.
|CAPCOM|And you guys have had some real winners there don't change a good life.
|CHALLENGER|Well, they seem to do all right for us -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 03:50 GET 174:57 MC-711/1
174:57:00|CHALLENGER|Well, they seem to do all right for us. I guess that's the way we were half way thinking, but not thinking very well, as was witnessed in our checklist procedures tonight.
|CAPCOM|Ah, you're doing outstanding.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. On your COMM your checklist will call for going to down voice backup. And, tonight, we'd rather just leave it in the normal voice, so if you leave the configuration you have rather that change it. That would be a good deal for us.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ken, I only got part of that, I was scrubbing my face here. You want to save the same COMM configuration we've got right now, is that correct.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, that's easy.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ken. Gene just stowed the EVA an tenn a.
|CAPCOM|Copy.
|CHALLENGER|And I'll be off COMM here just for a few minutes Bio med so, I'll be back with you when I turn in .
|CAPCOM|Okay. I may have misled you earlier, when I said, we weren't going to lose any time. We can -we can get you 8 hours here up to about 19 after the hour. And, after that we're going to have to start rearranging things to get 8 hours.
|CHALLENGER|Well, Gene's almost in his hammock now, and I will be shortly, so I think we're probably in pretty good s hape.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's fine. I just - I didn't want to mislead you.
|CHALLENGER|That's all right, you never misled me b e fore.
|CHALLENGER|Well, let me think about that.
|CAPCOM|Still think you came down awful slow, if that's true.
|CHALLENGER|Right.
|CHALLENGER|Ken, I'm going to take off my headset here and jump into the hammock. What time are we getting up CET - Central time.
|CAPCOM|Well, it's going to be roughly 45 minutes past the time listed in 182:39. So - Are you asking for it locat time?
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I - my watch is set on Houston Time, what time will it be? 8 hours from when?
|CAPCOM|Be about 12:15, Geno.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 03:50 GET 174:57 MC-711/2
174:57:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, that sounds great, Deke. It won't - We're just cle an in g up a few minor things and we 11 actually probably be asleep in the next 10 — 15 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sleep good. You've had a lovely day. Hope tomorrow -
|CHALLENGER|Sorry to keep - Thank you boss, sorry to keep you up so late. But, appreciate it very much.
|CAPCOM|We're enjoying it.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Gene, before you unplug your mike -
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'm going off the air.
|CAPCOM|- check your - check the suit Flow valve. Looks like it's not flowing if that's the configuration you w an t.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, we've got them both flowing. And we've got good circulation in the cockpit. If it looks good to you down there - we're in good shape up here.
|CAPCOM|Looks fine. See you later.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we thank you much.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 175 hours 21 minutes ground elapsed time. The crew of Challenger has signed off for the night, climbing into their hammocks. The Commander, Gene Cernan in the upper berth, Lunar Module Pilot, Jack Schmitt in the lower hammock, scheduled 8 hours sleep period, wakening shortly after noon, today. Command Module America apparently in a 67.8 minus 54.9 nautical mile orbit. Command Module Pilot, Evans has 4 hours and 22 minutes remaining of his sleep-period before being awakened, for plane-change maneuver and a trim maneuver, to get in the proper orbital plane for rendezvous. And at 175:22 taking down the air-ground 1 line, until somebody wakes up, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 05:00CST 176:06GET 712/1
176:06:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 176 hours 7 minutes ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Command Module America about 1/3 of the way through frontside pass on revolution 45. Fifty-two minutes remaining until America coasts behind the moon. The crew aboard Challenger, meanwhile is settling in for 8 hours sleep schedule sleep period which will end shortly after noon today, central time. Three hours 37 minutes remaining in the Command Module pilot's sleep period. Command Module America presently in a lunar orbit measuring 55.1 nautical miles at pericynthion by 67.7 nautical miles apocynthion. Gold team of flight controllers settled in for a 12 hour shift today, on a quick turn around. And at 176:08 ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 07:00 CST 178:07 GET MC-713/1
178:07:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 178 hours 7 minutes ground elapsed time. Command module, America, at the present time on the 46th lunar orbit immediately over the Taurus-Littrow landing site where the crew of Challenger has approximately 5-1/2 hours remaining in their sleep period. Evans, meanwhile, has some hour and 37 minutes remaining in his scheduled sleep period before wakeup call is made. For the coming day's activity, including a trim maneuver to tune up the command module's orbit and a plane change maneuver to place the command module in the proper orbital plane for the rendezvous which will take place after the lunar module has lifted off the lunar surface and is placed back into orbit around the Moon. The command module spacecraft systems are are all functioning normally at this time according to the the flight controllers here in the Control Center. Some 49 minutes remaining until America goes behind the Moon. At 178:08 ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 8:34 GET 179:41 714/1
179:41:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 179 hours 41 minutes ground elapsed time. About a minute until we have lock-on with the Command Module America on the 47th revolution around the Moon. Shortly after we have good solid lockup, the Spacecraft Communicator Ken Mattingly will call Ron Evans on Air-Ground 2 circuit for a wakeup. We'll bring that up at that time. Meanwhile the crew in the lunar module, Challenger, is still asleep at this time, with some 3 hours remaining until they're awakened. Standing by for word that we've locked onto the command module downlink. We've had acquisition. We'll bring up Air—Ground 2 and standby for the wakeup call to command module America.
|CAPCOM|Good morning, America. Rise and shine.
|CAPCOM|Hello, America, this is Houston. Over.
|AMERICA|Hey Houston, this is the Command Module Pilot in the United States Space Ship, America. I'll be ready to go to work as soon as I can get untangled.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got plenty of that for you.
|AMERICA|(laughter) Okay, I think I woke up just before you called - for some reason.
|AMERICA|The VHF is OFF.
|AMERICA|Houston, at least it's daylight today. Yesterday you got me up in the middle of the night.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 08:44 GET 179:51 MC-715/1
179:51:00|CAPCOM|Ah, this is a gentleman's day.
|AMERICA|(Chuckle) right.
|AMERICA|Guess it's really a 2 hour day, when you go around the Moon, isn't it?
|CAPCOM|You don't get so tired that way.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) Right.
|AMERICA|Okay, (garble) mode is to voice, squelch is, this is off, I'm going to leave it in (garble) minute and manual (garble).
|AMERICA|Houston, America. If you happen to have a summary report of EVA 3, I'd sure like to hear it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll do that. Let me give you a quick run down on review of what we're going to do this morning. And, we've got the extra RCS trim burn that's going to be coming in. And I've got a Pan for that guy and I have about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, one-liners to go into your flight plan, to bring it up to date. The general plan is to do a minus X RCS on the trim maneuver, in order to avoid impinging on the SIM bay, that burn will be about 30 seconds worth. And that's going to give you about 9 foot per second DELTA V. The maneuvers have all been checked out, and it's a reasonable timeline. And, so I have both the plane change and the trim PAD's for you. And that may cut into your eat-period just a little bit. So, you might keep that in mind, that when you get a chance to nibble that's probably a good thing to be doing. And then once we finish the plane change, we're going to be back on the nominal flight plan and pressing on in a - just like we have been. We'll be leaving the mapping camera in and taking pictures with it still retracted in an attempt to avoid increasing the number of cycles on the camera. And we'll be running the SPS PU valve in the decreased position, in order to optimize our propellant modings.
|AMERICA|Ah, ha. Okay. That sounds like it's good.
|CAPCOM|So when you're ready to copy some of those things, might be a good thing to get started on. So go ahead and finish squaring away your cockpit. And while they're putting together an official summary I can tell you my unofficial summary of EVA 3 and is that that sure is super. You've got to watch those tapes when you get down. That's really a - that's really a spectacular place as you can probably see. And they found a lot of mighty interesting rocks there.
|AMERICA|Oh, it's real good.
|CAPCOM|Jack, being the crew-geologist is making up new geological terms as he goes along.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) I can — yeah, I bet.
|CAPCOM|What you ought to do is, when he get's aboard, you ought to tell him that you saw a bunch of vertical diclates over on the north side of the Massif. Tell him
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 08:44 GET 179:51 MC-715/2
179:51:00|CAPCOM|they were very dark, very small.
|AMERICA|Vertical diclates?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I think that's the word he coined on the way down there.
|AMERICA|Diclates? Okay. (Laughter)
|AMERICA|Hey, I got a update book here, I guess it'll be good for a print book - printing the mode on.
|CAPCOM|Okay. In general, let me tell you also that your RCS is 4.7 above the flight plan. And just as a summary, unless you want to plot them, I'll just tell you that with the oxygen and the hydrogen are doing good things. And you've got plenty of It. And I'm ready to give you ah -The first PAD will be a trim RCS burn and the second will be the plane change burn.
|AMERICA|Okay. No, that's good on the hydrogen and oxygen. And I might copy the trim P30 PAD.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll give you the trim. RCS G&N 37416, GET 181:34:0122 plus 000:92 all zips and all zips. Roll 180, 179 316, 00673 plus 00624, 00092, 030, 00092, 13, 29, 23, 299. And at Sirius and Rigel 118, 159, 349. This will be 4 jets minus X on the RCS. And I'd like to just add a comment here about the attitude. This attitude is one that's computed after you've gone to the plane—change rest mat and when you call P41 you'll be getting a different set of attitudes computed out of it, because of the P41 computing a plus X burn. But, when you're in attitude and P41's called and you get to the DELTA V register you should be able to put all the DELTA V in one axis.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay. This really is a posigrade burn is what you're saying. And I really won't be able to trim It.
|CAPCOM|I'm not sure I understood your comment there .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 8:54 GET 180:01 716/1
180:01:00|AMERICA|In other words, we're not changing NOUN 81, you know, like we'do on the SEP maneuver.
|CAPCOM|Oh, that's correct. You're going to see the numbers go to zero during the burn.
|AMERICA|Okay, real good. We just won't be the right attitude, we'll use the verb 29 maneuver and use that attitude.
|CAPCOM|That's correct and when you get there, that should put it all in the X-axis.
|AMERICA|Okay, mighty fine.
|CAPCOM|Now I'm ready for the readback.
|AMERICA|Oh, let me read it back. Okay, will be G&N RCS for the trim burn rate is 37416, TIG is 181340122, I'm not sure on the second, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's correct.
|AMERICA|Okay, noun 81 plus 9.2 and that's 00, ROLL 180 PITCH 179 YAW 316, HA is 67.3 perigee 62.4 delta V total is 9.2, burn time is 30 seconds delta VC is 9.2, sextant star is 13, shaft is 292.3, pleniun is 29.9 and Sirius and Rigel 118, base potential line and YAW line is 349 and it'll 4 jetts minus X and it'll be at the plane change REFSMMAT.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and that PITCH aline is 159.
|AMERICA|Okay, PITCH aline 159.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the next one will be the plane change and I'll have that ready in just a second.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm in the flight plan for that one ,
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by for just a second.
|CAPCOM|Okay, LOPC SPS G&N 37416 plus 038 plus 09218233 5300 minus 00179 minus 03655 minus 00069 ROLL 0, PITCH 0, YAW 315 00627 plus 00626 03660 0 20 035 382 214 89 195 Sirius and Rigel and the ROLL PITCH and YAW lines are the same 118 159 349. This will be 4 jets and 12 seconds.
|AMERICA|Okay, LOPC SPS G&N 37416 plus 038 plus 0.92 TIG 1823353.00 NOUN 81 is minus 17.9 minus 365.5 and a minus 6.9 ROLL 0 PITCH 0, YAW 315 HA 62.7 perigee 62.6 (garble) is 366.0, burn time is 20 seconds, delta vc 353.8 sextant star 22 shaft 1 48,9 and 19.5 Sirius and Rigel 118159 349, 4 jetts 12 seconds.
|CAPCOM|Okay, a good readback. And I've got a couple of flight plan things to give you when you're ready for the m,
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm with you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the first one is at 180 hours and 2 0 minutes.
|AMERICA|I've got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we owe you an attitude there and the attitude will be 179222359, the high gain PITCH minus 39 YAW 145. Why don't you read them back, individually as we go along.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 8:54 GET 180:01 716/2
180:01:00|AMERICA|Okay, ROLL 179, PITCH 222, YAW 359, high gain will be minus 39 and 145.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and that's at 180:20, that's with the VERB 49, the next one is at 181:35 which is on the next page and it's going to be at VERB 49, maneuver to LOPC, what we're going to do here is 2 separate maneuvers, we're going to do a maneuver, which is a ROLL so that when you do the next one, you'll avoid the gimbal lock because of the direction that the CMC would normally maneuver you in. So this maneuver is going to be in 2 parts, the first one we're calling a VERB 49 maneuver to the gimbal lock avoidance attitude at 181:35. That attitude 081181 and 317, the high gain PITCH minus 19, YAW 227 and AUTO and narrow for AOS.
|AMERICA|Okay, at 181:35 we'll have a VERB 49 that will gimbal lock the brakes, ROLL 081181 and 317, high gain will be a PITCH of minus 19 and YAW 22 7, AUTO and narrow for AOS .
|CAPCOM|Okay, now at 181:43, you can just skip that high gain call out. At 181:45, we want to add a VERB 49 maneuver to the LOPC burn attitude.
|AMERICA|Okay, at 181:45 VERB 49 to LOPC burn a tt it ude.
|CAPCOM|Okay, now on the next page, we go over to 182:15 and I want to add a PU valve to decrease.
|AMERICA|182:15, PU valve to decrease.
|CAPCOM|Alright, sir. And I have 2 more to give you, but before we'do that - how about let's terminate the jet monitor by calling P30 P20 and a VERB 21, NOUN 26 to all zips and then we can uplink while we're finishing.
|AMERICA|Okay, you have ACCEPT.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and you got the monitor terminated.
|AMERICA|Yes, it's terminated.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72, 09:04CST 180:11GET 717/1
180:11:00|AMERICA|I guess we went through P30 faster than it showed up down there, or went into P30 not through it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, why don't you put the pan camera to STANDBY and the power ON while we're about it and we can let them look at that stuff while we're getting the rest of our flight plan updates.
|AMERICA|Pan camera STANDBY power is ON.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CAPCOM|All right let's go back to our updates and the next one1should come at 182 44.
|AMERICA|Okay, 182 44.
|CAPCOM|Okay at 182 44 I want to delete the mapping camera extend1,
|AMERICA|Okay delete the mapping camera extend. Wait a minute. I scratched that to open in recovery when we got to that.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, you won't do that because we re going to take the pictures anyhow.
|AMERICA|Yeah, okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, then the next thing we want to do is at 182:48 just a half inch down. I have a new attitude for you. Where it says 097 068 019 it's now going to be 096 097 and 352 and the orb rate attitude is still all zeroes.
|AMERICA|Okay the attitude after the P20 (GARBLE) plus X burn will be 096, 097 and 35 2 and orb rate is 0.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that last angle was 352. I'm not sure we got that right.
|AMERICA|Okay 352 for yaw. That's correct.
|CAPCOM|All right, sir. And while we're about it why don't you take the pan camera power back off. AMERICAN1Okay pan camera power is off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and as long as we're talking about pan cameras let's go to 183 45. AMERICAN1Be 345 okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and after the pan camera block want to add V over H override to high altitude.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's pan camera STANDBY, stereo and POWER, put V over H to high altitude.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative and the last update is on the next page - 184:27. And it says mapping camera retract and since we'didn't extend it you don't have to retract it.
|AMERICA|Ah - sounds logical. Okay, mapping camera - delete the mapping camera retract.
|CAPCOM|All right, sir. And let's see what else we have here - how about running your paw over most of your BIOMED sensors. Looks like you've got some noise on there. And avoid changing them. Why don't you just kind of rub on each one and see if we can get it to come in a good signal.
|AMERICA|Okay. I'll do that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 09:04CST 180:11GET 717/2
180:11:00|CAPCOM|Okay, you're making process there.
|AMERICA|Hey, it's working, huh?
|AMERICA|Hey, there's old Hadley Rille out there. That's a pretty deep little (garble). Hey you really didn't get a perspective of that thing, at least I didn't from some of the pictures. Not till you had a chance to get up here and take a look at some of the other things.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll tell you when we get through.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's the last of the flight plan th in gs , h uh ?
|CAPCOM|Yes sir, that was the last of the flight plans and I still need a morning report from you and things like that and I'll keep an eye on the clock down here and try to help you stay on the timeline. The one thing that I see that may have to change is I gave you a DELTA VC for the RCS burn that wasn t very useful and we have to set it up to count in the other direction. There's a couple of things you can do - like set it to 100.
|AMERICA|Yeah, okay1(
|CAPCOM|It's just a backup monitor anyhow and so it s setting it to 100 is probably the first thing to do.
|AMERICA|Yeah, I know.
|AMERICA|Okay, let me see if I've got time to put some hot water in my eggs.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron the computer Is yours whenever you want to go to block.
|AMERICA|Sleep last night was probably about 6 hours - kind of intermittent - but it seemed to me like when I was sleeping I was sleeping pretty good. For some reason I woke up a couple or 3 hours after I went to sleep and I got to sleep about an hour late. Oh, and I was just itching like a son of a gun.
|CAPCOM|What's that the sensors?
|AMERICA|The only thing I can think of - no, my arms - you know my forearms -
|CAPCOM|Oh, I see.
|AMERICA|From the wrist back to the elbow.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|The only thing I can think of is maybe the old beta cloth itch, you know. Then I looked around and there was nothing there. You know, no hives or anything like that. So I got out some of that carrying cream and put that on and that stopped it and went back to sleep.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It's coming up on time to start our first VERB 49 maneuver which can keep me running and I'll watch the angles while you put a little hot water in your food there if you want to.
|AMERICA|Okay, I've got a target load I guess in desired orientation. Okay, 2 VERB 499 VERB 25.

|CAPCOM|Okay, I copied the angles for you, if you need them.
|AMERICA|Okay. It scares me everytime that light comes on. Ah ha, it went away, (garble) (garble) What the coarse align error is.
|AMERICA|Just barely in the sextant field of view.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|(garble).
|AMERICA|Let's try Dnoces again. Pretty logical for this attitude. But we'didn't need your -
|CAPCOM|Okay and the angles I called you last time, we're 217 on the shaft and 33 on the trunnion.
|AMERICA|Just in the sextant again.
|AMERICA|Looks like 217 33 is going to be it once you get it in there. I'll settle for that. There's old coarse align there. I'll let you copy those down there, I don't want them up he re .
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And you can torque anytime.
|AMERICA|And let's see - okay, we'll torque at 34:30.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's a good number.
|AMERICA|Ah ha, knows exactly where it is, okay.
|CAPCOM|Isn't that amazing?
|AMERICA|Yeah.
|CAPCOM|And it shows we even know how to calculate the burn attitude.
|AMERICA|Yeah, that's good.
|AMERICA|Okay, CMC link 2.
|AMERICA|Okay, here we go.
|CAPCOM|And, Ron, I just noticed that in all our scribbling, I missed the line that said configure for the dump on the previous call about 23, I don't know if you saw it in the re or not.
|AMERICA|I missed it. I'll sure get it.
|CAPCOM|And when it's convenient for you I've got -
|AMERICA|Okay -
|CAPCOM|- couple of hydrogen tank fans to change and the good docs would like to hear how you're eating and pushing pills.
|AMERICA|Okay. Took a seconal last night, and by the H2 f ans .
|CAPCOM|Okay and that's hydrogen tank 3, fans OFF and hydrogen tank 1, fans ON.
|AMERICA|Okay, number 3 went from AUTO to OFF, tank 1 is going from OFF to ON.
|CAPCOM|Very good.
|AMERICA|Let's see, I got that done - at 40, next thing we got coming, huh? Okay, I'll go down there and get some of this stuff configured. Oh, I ate just about everything
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 09:24 CST 180:31 GET MC-719/2
180:31:00|AMERICA|yesterday, and then some other things and a bunch of extra stuff too, so when I get a chance, I'll call that down, okay?
|CAPCOM|Sounds fine.
|AMERICA|Get ready for this urine dump.
|AMERICA|Heater so.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 09:34CST 180:41GET 720/1
180:41:00|CAPCOM|And Ron we're coining up on dump time and don't forget we want to close the covers and that kind of good stuff before we start the dump.
|AMERICA|Okay EV cover is - Let's see — EV is off. IR is off. That's yeah, I started an old fuel cell purge here, (garble) fuel cell purge. Now let's see, waste - Okay. Waste water dump is on. Mark zero.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|GARBLE valve is dump. Battery vent is closed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron the EECOM calculated about 12 minutes to go on your dump and it wouldn't hurt to set your kitchen clock or whatever you do to help remind yourself because that'll be after LOS. And we've taken a look at all of the systems and everything looks pretty good there and RETRO would like to remind you that the weight has changed on your trim pad and that has some implications to the way that computes the burn arcs and you want to be super precise and looks like everything is go for a trim.
|AMERICA|Okay, sounds good. I'll set my little ding ding here for about 10 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Why don't you try about 9? Charlie swears it's no more than that.
|AMERICA|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 09:44 CST 180:51 GET MC721/1
180:51:00|CAPCOM|Oddly, Charlie.
|AMERICA|Want me to configure the DSE are you going to set it up for me?
|CAPCOM|Why don't you do that one.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Come in Ron. We've got about a minute and a half to LOS and I never did give you a summary of the EVA - just a few quick particulars. They got 7 plus 15 on EVA 3. Got almost everything done. Had to delete station 10 in order to make up time but that's made up for by the fact that they found some more interesting things at other stops. And there was - I mention the datelets, and there's some indication that they may have seen that - a dike or something of that nature over on the North Massif. And Jack went out and applied all his - his physical skills to the lunar surface gravimeter and that included jumping and kicking and pounding and it still doesn't work.
|AMERICA|(laughter)
|CAPCOM|Guess we'll get them up about 183:45 and the only thing we've had to do on their surface checklist for launch day is just to scrub the P22 that was in there and we're just going to drop that one to make up some time. And it looks like they ought to get about 8 hours sleep out of it so looks like everybody is in good shape. And you've got just a few seconds to LOS. Keep you eye on -(garble) water and we'll see ya.
|AMERICA|There it is. Good, but - thanks Ken.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal from the spacecraft America, going behind the Moon and nearing the end of revolution number 47. Now ground elapsed time of 180 hours 56 minutes. Two hours 48 minutes remaining until Cernan and Schmitt, aboard the lunar module Challenger, awakened at Taurus-Littrow. And approximately 48 minutes until America comes around again, coming up on two maneuvers. Spacecraft communicator, Ken Mattingly, read up the PAD's or the data needed by the command module pilot for performing these maneuvers. The first is a trim maneuver to tune up the command module orbit, prior to the lunar orbit plane change maneuver. The trim maneuver will be done on the back side of the Moon when we're out of contact with the spacecraft. That trim maneuver is scheduled at 181:34:01 or 181 hours 34 minutes 1 second ground elapsed time. Total velocity change In posigrsde - 9.2 feet per second. Burn time RCS - that's with the reaction control system engine - 30.06 seconds and as Mattingly mentioned to Evans, it's being done in so called minus X direction. In
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 09:44 CST 180:51 GET MC721/2
180:51:00|PAO|other words the spacecraft will pitch over engine bell forward toward the direction of flight so that Evans will see where he's been instead of where he's going. And the RCS thrusters will fire forward so that the instruments in the SIM bay will not be damaged by the exhaust plume from the rearward firing engines. The effect is the same, however the spacecraft's performing the maneuver in a pitched over attitude and actually 180 degrees away from the original land direction. On the next front side, pass, then, following that the scheduled lunar orbit plane change maneuver putting the command module America back into proper co—planer path with the landing site for rendezvous later today. This maneuver is scheduled at ground elapsed time of 182:33:53. Total burn time on the SPS engine of 20.07 seconds, for a velocity change of 366 feet per second. This a burn that will force the plane of the orbit back to coincide with that of the lunar module as it makes its ascent from Taurus-Littrow back into orbit for the rendezvous sequence. The orbital measurements after the trim burn will be 67.3 nautical miles apocynthion by 62.4 at pericynthion. The plane change maneuver has also some retrograde component in it. A very slight retrograde component, which will Circularize the orbit at 62.7 nautical miles. At 181 hours even, this is Apollo Control. p ao1This is Apollo Control at 181 hours 39 minutes ground elapsed time. Some 37 seconds now until the spacecraft, America, comes from behind the Moon on ^ revolution 48. One of the first items in business on this pass will be a report by command module pilot, Ron Evans, on the trim maneuver, which he will have completed just prior to acquisition on this rev. Two hours and 4 minutes remaining in the Challenger crew sleep period. Waiting now from word from network that the - We've had acquisition now. We'll stand by for the initial calls.

181:39:00|AMERICA|Ah, Ha, it looks like we're getting you already.
|CAPCOM|Hello there. How's it going?
|AMERICA|Okay, just now calling the VERB 82. It s 67.4 by 62.8. Okay, let me give you a little burn report here.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|AMERICA|(garble) reading on the burns, so you can get that off the recorder.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Let's see. Okay, with 30 seconds of burn time, by my stopwatch there, I ended up with a plus — no, let s see  with a minus . 5X. I think 0 in Y and a plus .5 in Z. Okay, so I tweaked out the plus X and roll right 90 degrees and burned a .6 in a plus Y. Okay, with final trim of - on a 985 0 plus .1 and a minus .1. Delta V C was a minus 110.4 but we have that - not a minus, a plus 110,4. But there's no bias check at a plus .9 on the bias.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, the NOUN 20 values - 920 values- after the 90 degree roll, there and through the final trim, were 270 179 317.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds like you're way ahead of the game.
|AMERICA|Yeah, worked real fine.
|CAPCOM|Have you had a chance to get anything to eat yet ?
|AMERICA|Yeah, I ate some scrambled eggs and I'm doubling out the bacon bars, and I had a orange juice.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I wasn't trying to fish for a report, I was just trying to find out if you were still eating or (garble).
|AMERICA|(Laughter). I'm a little - I'm still eating a little bit. But we're in good shape.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You get a - you get a medal for not overdumping the waste water tank.
|AMERICA|Yeah, it's amazing.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 10:32 CST 181:39 GET MC722/2
181:39:00|AMERICA|The old 9 minute mark was right on. I set it at 8 minutes, just to be sure, and 1 minute later it was tit for tat. Tell Charlie (garble) right there.
|CAPCOM|(Well, we won't be able to talk to Dumis again.
|AMERICA|(laughter) That's right.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I don't (garble).
|AMERICA|(garble).-
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Okay. And I don't know if you've got an explanation on why your angles changed for the P20 business after the burn but this - this plane change burn is going to have a little orbit shaping in it as well as the previous one. So that it - it is going to have some components that are both radial and tangential.
|AMERICA|Ah Ha. Okay.
|CAPCOM|So that meant that your REFSMMAT wasn't quite the REFSMMAT that you were anticipating earlier. And that explains the — why those angles had to change on you and also explains some of those odd ball components.
|AMERICA|Okay. Okay. I was wondering about that but - I'll tell you - those guys in the trench down there knows so much more about what's going on when they calculate that stuff than I do that I'll - I'll believe them.
|CAPCOM|Say, Ron, are you - are you in a place where you can spare a minute or two? Is it convenient?
|AMERICA|Sure.-
|CAPCOM|Okay. Got somebody that would like to talk to you for just a minute.
|AMERICA|Oh, yeah. FLETCHER1Ron, this is Jim Fletcher. How are you?
|AMERICA|It is - Dr. Fletcher - mighty fine, Sir. FLETCHER1We had hoped to catch you last night but you were behind the Moon when the ceremony was going on. Did you catch any of it at all?
|AMERICA|Well, I - I got the briefing on the report from it from the CAPCOM but it sounds like it was a mighty fine ceremony and something that this nation can really be proud of. FLETCHER1Well, Ron, there's one thing that the President wanted to make sure that you got. And I had hoped to do it last night. We've been in very close touch with the Whitehouse and the President has been following closely what - what's going on up there and of course, it's absolutely fascinating to us down here. But he wanted to be sure that you understood that he'd like to wish you APOLLO L7 MISSION COMMENTARY L2/14/72 10:32 CST 181:39 GET MC722/3 FLETCHER1God's Speed as you return to Earth. And I must say I'd like to add that and also add that, from everything I've heard, this is a spectacular success.
|AMERICA|Thank you very much, there, Dr, Fletcher, and please convey my thanks to Mr. President. I appreciate that very much and I also appreciate the opportunity to be able to do something for my country and I - hopefully this is the one thing that I will be able to do. And I certainly appreciate it. Just the thoughts, themselves, really. FLETCHER1Well, very good, Ron. I'd just like to say that I've never - I've never had any idea what so ever that things would go so well in the scientific part of the orbital science. It's - it's almost unbelievable when I talk to the guys in the back room and I just wanted to make sure that you knew that I knew it.
|AMERICA|Yes sir. We certainly do and they worked real hard to get the - these experiments and the equipment all squared away. I was following along with them pretty well and I had lot of confidence. FLETCHER1Well, very good. Thanks kindly.
|AMERICA|Yes sir, Dr. Fletcher, and I appreciate it .
|CAPCOM|And Ron, how about high-gain.
|AMERICA|Okay, let me reset it here.
|PAO|That was NASA Administrator, Dr. James C. Fletcher. He was passing along a similar message to the one that he spoke to the crew in Challenger on yesterday while Evans was apparently behind the Moon, or at least out of contact on that particular circuit.

|AMERICA|Okay, I'm right there so we've got her.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and let's see we've got a few minutes. I had two more magazine changes to go into the flight plan if it's convenient to give them to you now.
|AMERICA|Let me get started on the other VERB 49 here, okay ?
|CAPCOM|Okay, just fine.
|AMERICA|315. Plus enter - plus add one more proceed. Okay, we're on our way.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, just for your information about 291 looks like the maximum yaw you ought to see on this one. We'll keep an eye on it for you.
|AMERICA|Okay. 203. Okay, why don't we take some of those flight plan changes here?
|CAPCOM|Okay. And these are real simple ones on p age 2 8 3.
|AMERICA|283. That's really looking ahead. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay at 187 45 you've got a magazine Bravo Bravo called out and we'd like to make that Delta Delta.
|AMERICA|Delta Delta it is.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and a couple of lines below that you have a magazine November November which we want to change to Kilo Kilo.
|AMERICA|Kilo it is.
|CAPCOM|Okay that was kind of painless wasn't it.
|AMERICA|Yeah, that was.
|CAPCOM|And that's all I've got. We want to remember to get the PU valve to decrease.
|AMERICA|Yeah, I can do that now, I guess, couldn't I.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, we're setting on the minus 200 degrees.
|AMERICA|Put a time here and let me yak. Bring you up to date on the - hookup.
|AMERICA|Okay, ready to go with the food?
|CAPCOM|Yes sir.
|AMERICA|Looks like we're going to miss it.
|AMERICA|Okay, today sausage, grits, fruit cocktail, orange beverage, coffee and tea and a vitamin. Lunch box, ham -couldn't find my cheese until last night so I didn't have it. One rye bread, can of peaches or sack of peaches, cereal bar, orange drink, coffee, graham cracker cubes, apricot cubes, jelly candy, sugar cookies. Supper - had hamburger and catsup, vanilla pudding, grape drink, I guess that was it.
|CAPCOM|All right, sir. We've got about 34 minutes or so until the burn. I've got a news summary I can read if you'd like to have that or put it off until later I can do that too.
|AMERICA|No', why don't you go ahead.

|CAPCOM|This is put together by Mr. Jim Kotowsky and it looks like he's done a pretty nice job of summarizing the news so I'm going to read it cold. And he's given us a summary of the late news. And the weather couldn't be worse in Houston. It had to be better on the Moon or in orbit around it. This morning more cold and drizzle blanketed the Houston metropolitan area. Yesterday morning it was 32 degrees. This morning a little warmer but a lot wetter and it's getting colder on Friday. On the National International scene peace talks in Paris between Dr. Henry Kissinger and Le Due Tho have ended - at least for the time being. Dr Kissinger is in Washington today to brief President Nixon on the talks. The past 3-1/2 weeks the pair of negotiators have held 58 hours of talks. Neither side is getting —

Transatlantic fares may drop beginning in February. The International Air Transport Association says all carriers will set their own prices. It appears that air travelers to Europe next year may get some real bargains. In the hotly contested and Federally supervised United Mine Workers election the inserted candidate, Arnold Miller has gone into a lead over incumbent President Tony Boyle. Miller has lead a grass routes movement to ask Boyle to lower the union control from the late John L. Lewis. We mentioned the rather dismal weather in the Houston area this morning. The midwest and northeast are really getting some bad weather. Ice storms seriously hampered the northern part of the Nation, from Idaho to the eastern seaboard. After almost a year, troops involved in the India, Pakistanian War, are beginning to go back to their homelands. Truce-line maps have been exchanged and approved by both governments. Civil servants of the European common market they're called Euricrats are on strike. Eight thousand employees walked off the job due to a salary dispute. On the regional and local scene, the Houston City Council has vetoed a plan to build a new commuter air strip in southwest Houston for the Stol aircraft. Residents of the area have been protesting it. A community of Tomball north of Houston, is looking for a new Police Force. The Police Chief and 7 officers walked off the job Tuesday, after the City Council refused the officers a pay-raise. In Harris County, the State Highway Patrol and reserved police have been called in to maintain police protection. That s maintain protection in Tomball. The project to expand the-expand the Armand Bayou as a park and wildlife refuge has been given a boost with a 100 000 dollar pledge.

Christmas trees are in tents, on street corners and super market sites all over the area. Private homes throughout the whole area are lighting up with decorations ranging from Happy Santa Clauses in sleighs to Nativity Scenes. It will be a Christmas World waiting for you when you come home. And that ends our summary for this morning.
|AMERICA|That's a good sumary, appreciate it. Little bit of everything in there.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, it looks like Mr. Kotowsky read a lot of newspapers there.
|AMERICA|(Laughter)
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We're picking up some thermal problems on the pan camera would you manually roll left to 30 degrees and we'll hold it until we ve passed — you know the terminator - across the terminator.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, that terminator crossing comes fairly close to the burn, so you might think about -if it looks agreeable to you, just go ahead and we'll use that as the burn attitude. You'll have to get a new P40 trim to take care of the gimbal offsets. So you may see a slight pitch and yaw attitude change.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's no problem. I'll just roll that and then use a P 41 trim.
|AMERICA|It's - It's on command to make that 90 degree roll the other day, or just awhile ago. And if you hit your stick a little too hard you really wrapped it up to a little better than a degree a second. So, you can really get a good sensation to roll, especially when you can see the Moon.
|AMERICA|How's that? Pretty good attitude?
|CAPCOM|Looks like we'll have to go a little bit further. Why don't you give us 5 or 10 more.
|AMERICA|Okay, I didn't let go of the stick
|CAPCOM|Ah, you're learning our tricks, aren't you.

|CAPCOM|Uh huh.
|AMERICA|If you need any extra electronics, we sure could use another cloth hat.
|CAPCOM|Oh, you can wash it off. You probably do that inadvertently.
|AMERICA|I already have. I didn't wash it with the right thing though.
|CAPCOM|I was wondering if you would own up to that. Hey, the good Doctor over here says that your traces are flat lines - thought you ought to be aware of that.
|AMERICA|Oh, they are.
|CAPCOM|You feel okay?
|AMERICA|They're kind of itching it - they're kind of itch - yes, I'm okay, but they're kind of itching anyhow. I feel like I ought to change them so -
|CAPCOM|Okay, that would really make him happy.

|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|It's (garble)
|CAPCOM|Alrighty, we're about 4 minutes from LOS and all systems have been looked at and they're all looking okay so guess we'll see you on the other side.
|AMERICA|Okay, how's my stuff, now? I got plugged in.
|CAPCOM|we'don't see anything yet.
|AMERICA|Didn't huh.
|AMERICA|Well, I needed to change them anyhow so -
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|I'll try to -
|CAPCOM|Looks like you hit something there when you did that.
|AMERICA|I was just shaking my coffee.
|CAPCOM|I tell you it sure put life in the s ignal.
|AMERICA|It did?
|CAPCOM|How are those binoculars working out?
|AMERICA|They're working real good. I find I have a bit of a problem holding them still though.
|CAPCOM|Yes, they're about the max magnification I think, that you can handle. AME RI C A1Yes.
|CAPCOM|Have you tried looking in earthshine at it and see if you can pick up anything there?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 11:40 GET 182:47 729/2
182:47:00|AMERICA|Yeah, and they just don't quite look as - let enough light through, I don't think in Earthshine . You can see better with the naked eye, but they don't let enough light through the binocs to enhance your image capability at all.
|CAPCOM|Alright, I was curious because I notice in the dark shadows in the daylight side they did bring out things that you couldn't see with the naked eye. I guess that's contrast that does that.
|AMERICA|Yeah, I noticed that too. Yeah, you can look down at the shadow of a crater where you got the sun down there, but if you have more back lighting or something. You know but you can see that pretty good with the naked eye anyhow. Earthshine, now, about all I can get out of Earthshine, really, are different albedo. And you can get some textural, well, not so much textural difference, but the terrain, bumps and humps and and flow-fronts and see craters you know.
|CAPCOM|I wish I was there with you.
|AMERICA|I tell you I had no idea how interesting and how much fun it would be. After the first day and I finally got over the, I guess you could - I don't know, you call it the effects of adapting to zero g or something. But you are just a little bit woozy, you really don't feel like doing a heck of a lot the first day up. So it's good that the first day is kinda
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Command Module, America, passing behind the Moon on the end of the 48th lunar orbit. 48 minutes until the crew of Challenger is awakened at Taurus Littrow. During the just completed front side pass the Command Module Pilot Ron Evans completed the lunar orbit plain change maneuver which went nominally on time with velocity change of 366 feet per second using the service propulsion system engine. Just prior to that before he appeared on the front side of the Moon a small trim maneuver was performed using the forward firing reaction control system thrusters. This maneuver was to trim up the orbit. Some dispurs ions that had grown during the lunar orbit period that America has been in motion about the Moon. The Gold Team of Flight Controllers is handing over at the moment to their replacements after about a 12-hour shift. The oncoming team is the White Team of Flight Controllers headed up by Eugene Krantz. There will not be a change of shift press briefing of the off going shift. 47 minutes to wake up of the surface crew, Schmitt and Cernan. And at 182:57 this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 12:24 GET 183:31 730/1
183:31:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 183 hours 32 minutes. We're about 14 minutes away from the scheduled wakeup time for Apollo 17 - the lunar module crew, however they beat us to the punch this morning and we just got a rousing rendition of "Good Morning To You" sung by the crew of Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on the lunar surface. The Surgeon reports that the two crewmen appear to have gotten a good nights sleep - 6 to 7 hours, and we'll pick up with the taped replay of that Good Morning rendition from the crew and then follow it live, (music)
|CAPCOM|Good morning Challenger and thank you for the vocal rendition from the Moon there.
|CHALLENGER|Well, we thank you for your kind music. We wanted to let you know we were thinking about you this morning, Gordie.
|CAPCOM|You just beat us to it, but -
|CHALLENGER|That was a great song.
|CAPCOM|Decided to play it anyway, cause it was such a pretty selection.
|CHALLENGER|I think it's very apropo at the moment. I guess I can just wait for "Hail Purdue", huh?
|CAPCOM|Yes, just standby, you'll probably hear it before you get back.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, we've been stirring for about 15 or 20 minutes, we're in the midst of a nice hamburger omelet, (laughter) and assorted accessories. As a matter of fact, it's all over us. And if you'll give me 5 minutes, I'll be ready to go on the PNGS, unless you want to start at center.
|CAPCOM|Okay, no hurry, finish up and get cleaned up there, and the only change, we have some change in the timing as far as the checklist so we can gain back the time we're behind now, which is actually less than an hour. And the only hardware change other than deletions is that we'd like you to leave Demand Reg A closed at all times. So whenever you come across a place that says OPEN at cabin or egress, we'd like you to leave it closed.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie. We've got you on that. And Gordie, could I have a quick status report on America and Challenger?
|CAPCOM|You bet. America is just as good as gold just like always. Ron got off the trim burn on the backside followed by a good plane change on the front side. In fact he - G&N cutoff was a tenth or less in all axis. Didn't even need to trim it. So, he's in about a 62—1/2 circular, I believe, and waiting for you to come up and join him.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, how's his consummables?
|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|Okay, America's consummables are great and so are yours. There is a possibility we may have to switch to ascent water just prior to liftoff. Everything really is in good shape.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 12:24 GET 183:31 730/2
183:31:00|CHALLENGER|Those are good words, Gordie. Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Gordie. In honor of one of your comm handovers last night, and in th* tradition of Apollo 8, I've got paraphrase of a familiar poem for you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Well, it's "The week before Christmas and all through the LM, not a Commander was stirring, not even Cernan. The samples were stowed in their places with care, in hopes that with you, they soon will be there. And Cernan -Gene in his hammock and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long - short lunar nap. But out - up on COMM loop (garble) there rose such a scatter, I sprang from my hammock, to see what was the matter. The sun on the breast of the surface below gave the lustre of objects, as If in snow. And what to my wandering eyes should appear, but a miniature Rover and 8 tiny reindeer. And a little old driver so lively and quick, I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick. I heard him explain as over the hills he did speed. Merry Christmas to all and to you all God speed.
|CAPCOM|Very good.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, that was the first time I heard that and I've got to say that was beautiful.
|CAPCOM|I agree. Did the LMP get any sleep or did h spend all night composing that?
|CHALLENGER|People always said we ought to have a . poet in s pace.
|CHALLENGER|I don't think we've made it yet.
|CHALLENGER|No, for some reason I really woke up with one of your handovers last night, and that was how I went back to sleep.
|PAO|That poetic offering was from Jack Schmitt.
|CHALLENGER|(garble)
|CAPCOM|Rog, Jack.
|PAO|We're about 15 seconds now, from re acquiring America in its 49 revolution of the Moon.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. One update for the postsleep procedure. I understand you brought in the LMPs camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the jett bag before the final jettison here, and by the way, you're stay for that final jettison.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie, it's already in the jett bag, thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Gordie, you might make some notes that before I put it in there, I took another black and white or black and white window pan with mag Nancy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, on Reg A, that is - you determined that is just a small leak by the reg?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 12:34CST 183:41GET 731/1
183:41:00|CHALLENGER|- small leak by the reg. And it would be useable if you had to.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Geno. It's a small slow leak and it is useable if needed.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, thank you. It's coming up so far. I think that's all the system anomalies we've got, isn't it?
|CAPCOM|That's all I can think of at the moment. I do have revised times for the rest of the lunar surface checklist which at a convenient time I can give to you - so that you'll have a how goes it as you go on down the line here.
|CHALLENGER|Why don't you give them to us now Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, turn to page 7-9.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 7-9 LGC IMU power UP, change that time from 183 04 to 184 10. The eat period time is now 184 20. Turn the page and the 183 59 above park rendezvous radar is now 185 05. Next page don suits at 185 15. Go to the next page. Prep for equipment jettison is 185 50 and the same page - helmet glove donning is 185 58. Next page pressure integrity check 186 04. Cabin depress 186 08. And hatch opening is 186 12. Next page 17-14, cabin repress is 186 15. Cabin cleanup for launch is 186 20. And on the following page we're going to delte the P22 but we'd like you to do all the procedures except those from VERB 95 ENTER through POO ENTER inclusive - the center section of procedures, so you'll still be closing the rendezvous radar breakers going to LGC and parking the antenna and copy pad. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're going to delete everything from VERB 95 through POO into P22. That's the center of the page.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative and then the next page cabin press for ascent is 186 45 and instead of 39 minutes we're going to have you do that in 3 minutes. And you should have a little more time than that, since you got up early. That puts you right back with the timeline, at liftoff minus 1 hour 15, at 186 48. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, top at 7-15 where we pick up - we were going to do this again, you know, the P22. Have you got a time up there?
|CAPCOM|I guess we'll just have to work that in with cabin cleanup time. We had deleted that whole time block but you do have to catch those procedures.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and in the times on the top of 7-10, for P22 are not applicable and I guess you can give us an update for our P57 liftoff time.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. That might be - there's a couple more changes coming at me here but let me make sure I've got them straight and I'll call you later. Go ahead with whatever you were doing.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 12:34CST 183:41GET 731/2
183:41:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy, If I get ready for the LGC - I'll have you power up, I'll give you a call even though it comes earlier but I'd like to get that started - whenever you are readv to start it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we concur with that.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Gordy as far as the food, medication, and sleep goes - no medication, Gene had 5 hours of good sleep I had probably around my usual 6 inspite of my poetic informations, and the food - we continued to do well, I believe, we've eaten a wet pack a piece last night. We got one this morning. We've eaten our scrambled eggs and sausage yesterday, and as we've run out of juices, and tea and which is somewhat of an inconvenience I might say, and if you've got any specific questions I can fill you m on it but I think foodwise we've done pretty well.
|CHALLENGER|Can you give us a feel on the fluid intake?
|CAPCOM|Well, that's what I was trying to do when I said we'd drunk all the juices and tea. Plus, Gene, in particular, takes water from the hose,
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, fine. Sounds good. This is Apollo Control at 183 hours 49 minutes. ' Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt aboard Challenger on the lunar surface after having gotten up about 15 minutes early. Now having reakfast. They are a bit behind in the timeline but we expect to have them caught up by the time they - or about 1-1/2 hour prior to lunar lift-off, which is when we begin the really busy period of liftoff preparations, and everything appears to be going alone very smoothly at this time. The crew's early arising caught us a1unprepared here in mission control we had our own wake up tune to play up to them this morning which was to be the -titled theme from the motion picture 2001 A Space Oddessy, however they beat us to the punch with their own wake up song to the control center and we'll play that back for you at this time.
|CHALLENGER|(Singing),
|PAO|Anc* after giving us a few minutes to catch our bearings we hit them with the theme from 2001 A Space Oddessy since then things have been going along pretty much normally. The poetic offering was from Jack Schmitt. He said it was for all the kids back home. It was his version of the Night Before Christmas. We have reacquired Ron Evans aboard the Command Module America and everything is progressing very smoothly aboard that vehicle. We're on separate communication circuits at the present time and will be up until the revolution prior to LM liftoff at which time we'll switch back to a single air-to-ground a single spacecraft communicator operation and be able to follow the operation in both vehicles simultaneously. That will be at acquisition of signal on the CSM's 51st revolution.

|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, and I've got a couple more items to completely1cleanup the checklist whenever you can get to that f.
|CHALLENGER|I'll let Jack give you a call. I m going to start on the PGNCS when we're ready.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, you ready for a PGN.

184:01:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo (garble) test is complete and it's GO, and I'll give you an E memory dump.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're ready, stand by for it. And while it's coming, I could give you the updates for the next page .
|CHALLENGER|Okay, it's coming at you and you can go with the updates on the next page.
|CAPCOM|Okay, page 7-10 your P57 lift-off time, upper right corner is 188:01:4385, over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy P57 lift-off time 188:01:4385.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative and now we'd like you to delete all the steps below that lift-off time from the AT 3 data star info box through the VERB 32 after the last - after for the remaining data stars and after last star. In other words, just delete all between the box and up to circuit breaker AOT lamp open. And, of course, they're'll be no P22 time, over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Delete all the data star information. Between the start of that box and after last star VERB 34 enter 00 enter.
|CAPCOM|That's correct and then turn to page 7-15, we're changing - we - looking here a little closer we find that radar's already in good position so you can delete all procedures on page 7-15, except copy ascent PAD, CSI PAD and LM DAP weight.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'deleted everything but the last 3 lines on that page.
|CAPCOM|Okay, on page 7-12, back up a couple pages, in the lower right corner there in the blank space, you might down 185:58, VHF check with command module, and that'll be according to the procedures on 7-15 in the box. You might just parenthesis 7-15 to remind you where the procedure is, but the comm check will come during that time when you're prepping for equipment jettison, or right, around there.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we got that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's all we got for you, and we have the E MOD dump okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, we're in fluent data and we're standing by for your uplink, and how long does that AOT heater breaker have to be open? I pushed it in at 184:08.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll get an answer for that, and I think we'll be coming with the uplink here shortly.
|CAPCOM|Gene, no time constraint on that AOT breaker, except if it's foggy, it hasn't been in long enough.
|CHALLENGER|(laughter) Thank you Gordy.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 13:14 GET 184:21 MC735/1
184:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control with 184 hours 32 minutes. Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan aboard Challenger on the Lunar Surface at the present time, are going through the platform alignment getting their guidance & navigation equipment ready for Lunar liftoff. They will also shortly begin doning their pressure suits. And they appear to be running about 30 minutes behind the timeline, however, we expect they will have adequate opportunity to make up the lost time prior to a Lunar liftoff. And, we're looking for liftoff to occur pretty much on time at 188 hours 1 minute 44 seconds ground elapsed time. This is actually about 1 minute, 10 seconds earlier than the preflight plan with the difference caused by the fact that the Command Module for a period of time, was in a slightly smaller orbit than had been planned premission. With the plane-change and orbit circulation maneuver performed a few hours ago by the Command Module, that orbit is now back on the planned trajectory. However, because of the smaller orbit, the CSM was in for a period of time, the liftoff time of the LM has had to be moved up 1 hour 1 minute 10 seconds, to put the LM in the proper position with respect to the Command Module, for their rendezvous. This is. a so-called phasing consideration for the Lunar liftoff. Again lift off currently planned for 188 hour 1 minute 44 seconds or about 1 minute 10 seconds earlier than called for in the flight plan. Ron Evans aboard America is involved in scientific activities at the present time, getting set up for Zodiacal Light photography. Everything continues to go very smoothly aboard America. Evans a little while ago hooked up the inflight vacuum cleaner and powered it up to see if it was going to work. That piece of equipment will be used quite a bit after Schmitt and Cernan return to the Command Module with their dirty bags of rocks and dirty spacesuits and there will be quite a clean-up chore for all three crewmen in the Command Module. America at this time is in it's 49th revolution of the Moon, and about 20 minutes away from disappearing behind the Moon on this revolution. We're showing 3 hours 27 minutes now, until Lunar liftoff.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we see that.
|CAPCOM|Doesn't look like the Challenger shifted around much in the last three days.
|CHALLENGER|Well, at least it always settles back to the same spot.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're clear to torque those.
|CHALLENGER|Say, Gordy, are we clear to jettison the buddy PLSS bag now.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative Jack, we've determined that you won't need it for rock stowage. And along the same
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 13:14 GET 184:21 MC-735/2
184:21:00|CAPCOM|line, John Young suggested that you might check your checklist pockets on your suits when you get to that point. His were full of dirt. You might want to take those out and discard them if that's the case, so that it won't fly up and get you at insertion.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, we all ready did that, Gordy. They were a mess, and we took them off. They're in the jettison bag now.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|We're going to take time out for about 15 or 20 minutes of mandatory house keeping here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, understand.
|CHALLENGER|That's prior to suit doning.
|CAPCOM|Roger. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 13:34 GET 184:41 MC736/1
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 184 hours 52 minutes. In about 2 minutes 45 seconds, we'll be losing radio contact with Ron Evans aboard America as the CSM goes behind the Moon on the 49th revolution. At the present time, Evans is in the process of checking out the rendezvous transponder on board his spacecraft, the first in a series of steps he'll be taking to configure the CSM for the rendezvous with the lunar module. Aboard the lunar module, Challenger, on the lunar surface, the team of Cernan and Schmitt will soon begin getting into their space suits, getting the lunar module configured for liftoff, a process, a series of steps which they have already begun. And, everything aboard the lunar module appears to be very close to normal. We are looking at one minor problem, and that concerns the water aboard the descent stage of the lunar module. For some reason, the consumption of water has been a bit greater than was predicted. This water is used primarily, at least the bulk of it, is used for cooling equipment aboard the lunar module. It's boiled into the vacuum of the lunar atmosphere and carries away heat from the electronic equipment in the LM. If we run out of water in the descent stage, .the crew will simply switch over to the reserves of the ascent stage and use those prior to liftoff. Our current prediction is that the descent water will last up through 186 hours 40 minutes, plus or minus 1 hour, so as early as 185 hours 40 minutes, or as late as 187 hours 40 minutes we could run out of water. In the lunar module module descent stage, if we run out early, again the procedure would be to have the crew switch over to the ascent water supply. This again would, in turn, cause no problem. We have adequate reserves in the ascent stage of the LM for a normal or an abnormal rendezvous and docking. And, in about 30 seconds, we'll be losing radio contact with Evans aboard Ame ri ca.
|PAO|And, we've had loss of signal now with the CSM. Be reacquiring in about 45 minutes. The spacecraft at that time on the 50th revolution of the Moon. We'll continue with the dual line setup communicating with the CSM on one circuit and the lunar module on another circuit through the next revolution, then beginning with acquisition of signal with the command module on the 51st revolution, which is the LM liftoff rev, we'll be switching to a single communication circuit with a single spacecraft communicator. Again, Cernan and Schmitt appear to be running about 30 minutes behind the flight plan timeline, but we expect they'll have adequate opportunity to make up that time before liftoff in a couple of hours. There are places In the flight plan where there Is a bit of a built in pad* and they should have no trouble being ready for an on-time liftoff if things continue to go as smoothly as they are at the present time. Cernan and Schmitt both in good shape for the liftoff. Cernan reported he got about 5 hours of sleep, Schmitt about 6 hours. Both crewmen have been eating well, and, along with their vehicle, in good shape for the liftoff and subsequent rendezvous. This is Apollo Control at 184 hours 56 minutes.

|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SCHMITT|And, Gene will be on biomed shortly.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SCHMITT|Gordie, I'm back up.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|That last report from Jack Schmitt that he and Gene Cernan were reconfiguring their biomedical switches, harnesses, indicates that they're in the process of getting back into their pressure suits at this time.

|CAPCOM|Okay got that.
|CHALLENGER|LMP is 24150.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 185 hours 40 minutes. And we're about 45 seconds now from reacquiring the command module on it's 50th revolution of the Moon. During this front side pass Ron Evans aboard America among other things will be performing some land mark tracking using the optics equipment on the command module. This will provide information on the precise orbital plane of the command module that information then to be fed into the lunar module guidance system and used in the targeting of the lunar module for liftoff and subsequent rendezvous with the CSM. On the lunar surface aboard Challenger, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt have completed suit up. Their in the suits unpressurized without helmets and gloves on at the present time. And appear to be about 20 minutes behind the timeline. They made up about 10 of the 30 minutes they were down and it looks like they will have no problem getting caught up about and hour and 15 minutes before liftoff would liftoff essentially on time. However, as we mentioned earlier the LM liftoff will be about 1 minute 10 seconds earlier than the preflight flight plan called for. Liftoff based on the preliminary information generated by the flight dynamics officer to occur at 188 hours 1 minute 44 seconds. And we'll expect to have the flight dynamics officer final numbers for liftoff probably about an hour or to an hour and 15 minutes prior to liftoff.

|PAO|This is Apollo control at 186 hours 42 minutes. Cernan and Schmitt aboard the lunar module Challenger at this time are getting the cabin of the vehicle ship shape for liftoff. Their essentially back on the timeline at this time and ready to begin the final liftoff preparations. Aboard the command module America now in its 50th revolution everything continues to go very smoothly. Ron Evans is beginning to get suited up and configuring the command module for the LMs liftoff, rendezvous and docking.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 15:45 GET 186:53 MC-745/1
186:53:00|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 186 hours 54 minutes. We've just had loss of signal now, with Ron Evans aboard the Command Service Module. Everything going very smoothly at this time, and our preparations for Lunar lift-off will be reacquiring the Command Module in about 45 minutes. And at that time, we plan to reconfigure the CAPCOM or air-to-ground circuits with the two vehicles, so that we have both the Command and Service Module and the Lunar Module on the same circuit for the single spacecraft communicator operation. Included in the string of numbers read up to the crew aboard Challenger by CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton, was the time that will be used for ignition -
|CHALLENGER|(garble) 4.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Geno.
|PAO|The ignition time for Lunar lift-off now, as passed up to the crew, is 188 hours, 1 minute, 36 seconds. And that burn time on the Lunar Module ASCENT engine will be 7 minutes, 20 seconds.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo. The rendezvous radar looks a little warm and I'm reading about 90 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Okay, 90.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo, are you ready for AG status to operate?
|CAPCOM|Let me check. We're ready Jack, go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo. Now it's 72. RQ is not varying. I've got both shaft and trunion cross—pointers varying1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. We copy that.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy. On the radar test every thing is GO, everything is within limits. The only anomally is the one I just reported.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno. And 20 seconds here on the hour even we'll have a site hand over to Goldstone.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 187:01 CST 15:54 MC746/1
187:01:00|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. You can go ahead and park the radar at 0 and 30.
|CHALLENGER|Yes. It's gone there right now, as a matter of fact.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston. The AGS gyro calibration is complete and looks pretty good. I guess these are little, little, no, yes, these are little more than you'd expect I guess.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. Words on the radar. When you parked it there, we saw it go to the proper places. From all our indications, the interface between the radar and the PGNS is okay. And our best guess is some kind of selftest problem.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy. Thank you.
|CHALLENGER|Rate gyros are good.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo. I'm going to go to auto on the S-band, if you want it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're GO and go ahead with the check.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy. I'll give you a call, before I fire, but we're in the process of getting ready for the RCS. 
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 16:04 GET 187:11 MC747
187:11:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordo, here we go.
|PAO|Cernan and Schmitt, at this time, are firing the reaction control system thrusters in what's called the hot fire test. Everything continuing to progress smoothly toward liftoff at 188 hours 1 minute 36 seconds. And, we expect to have the lunar surface television up and in operation in about 10 minutes.
|CHALLENGER|Gordie, the AGS check looked good.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Looked good here also.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, just to make one more talkback still s t i cky .
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, here we go Into PNGS, Gordie.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno.
|CHALLENGER|Looked good here, Gordie,
|CHALLENGER|And, you've got DATA and POO.
|CAPCOM|Okay, your uplinks are coming. We'll give you vector and zero the power cells unless it's okay.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to put the ascent batteries on according to the procedures on the next page, 8—8. Just a little early because of preconditioning notice before descent, and we checked your RGA's during the hot fire, and the hot fire itself, and they both look good.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|And, Challenger, it's your computer now.
|CHALLENGER|Thank you.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're now 45 minutes from LM liftoff. Everything continuing to go very smoothly. We've completed the reaction control system's checkout. It looks good through the telemetry we're receiving here on the ground. Also, aboard the spacecraft, the primary guidance and backup guidance system clocks have been synchronized. The next item on the crew's preparation checklist will be to align the platform of their guidance system which is used as a stable attitude reference. And, we're now some 20 minutes from reacquiring the command module, which is now in its 51st revolution of the Moon. And, as mentioned before, when we'do acquire, we'll have both the LM and the command module on the same communication circuit.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 187:20 CST 16:13 MC748/1
187:20:00|CHALLENGER|Gordo, did you ever get any word on the Rover b attery?
|CAPCOM|No. I sure haven't. Haven't heard on that one .
|CHALLENGER|It's not important. I just wondered whether things were going to be working back there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got no reason to believe they won't. When you get down to parking the rendezvous radar antenna after this P57, give me a call. We're going to change the parking po s iti on.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Why don't you just give me the numbers now?
|CAPCOM|Okay. Do a, as the checklist shows, except do a VERB 41 NOUN 72 to 0 and 30 degrees. Go to slew and then delete the manual slew for 3 seconds. They want to leave it there for temperature purposes. This will be a cooler position for it during ascent.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Understand. That's 0 and 03 000.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CHALLENGER|And the first 01, first 04 was .01.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we got that.
|PAO|Cernan and Schmitt at this time are in the midst of the platform alignment and we're standing by for television from the lunar surface. The other camera on the Lunar Rover. And we're getting the first, first bits of the picture now. We should have color. And we'do have a color picture from the lunar surface.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. We've got you on tele vision now. Have a good picture.
|CHALLENGER|Glad to see old Rover's still working.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got your NOUN 5.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 16:23 GET 187:29 MC-749/1
187:29:00|CAPCOM|Go ahead untorque them.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 187 hours 31 minutes, now approaching 30 minutes until time for Lunar lift-off. The count down toward lift-off is going very smoothly. The crew aboard Challenger has completed aligning their inertial platform that's used as a stable attitude reference during powered flight. And we're less than 6 minutes now from regaining our radio communications with Ron Evans, aboard the Command Service Module, America. The television picture is coming to us from the Lunar Roving vehicle, parked about 490 feet west of the Lunar Module, looking toward the east. Cernan and Schmitt will shortly be going through their prelaunch switch checks, checking the configuration of all the switches in the Lunar Module. They'll then don their helmets and gloves.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston. (garble) looks good and the TIG's in auto.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger, there's no change to 047 and 053. I do have a K factor for you.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It's 179, 59, 5982. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, 179, 59, 5982.
|CAPCOM|That's right, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. I have a couple of PIPA BIAS updates, for the PNGS.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, a verb - with a VERB 21 NOUN 1, load address 1452 with 03045, and load address 1454 with 05246. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, that's 1452 with 03045, and 1454 with 05246.
|CAPCOM|Read back's good.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control now 25 minutes from Lunar lift-off. Aboard Challenger, the crew has set up their guidance computer at program 12, which is the program used for the Lunar lift-off. And we're less than 1 minute now, from regaining radio contact with Ron Evans aboard America.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, they're in, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Look good to us.
|PAO|And, we've had acquisition of signal now, from the CSM. About 10 minutes from now, the Lunar Module's scheduled to begin pressurizing the ASCENT propulsion tanks.
|AMERICA|Hey, Houston. America.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America. This is Houston, you're loud and clear.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 16:23 GET 187:29 MC-749/2
187:29:00|AMERICA|Okay, Gordo. Got my suit on -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We gave you the wrong SKINNY on the COMM configuration last REV. We're actually now, in a full MSFN relay mode. We'd like you to stay off of VOX. Over. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 16:33 GET 187:39 750/1
|CHALLENGER|Can do I'm off VOX.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston, when you get to a break point I have some words on what you can expect in the way of guidance steering. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Stand by.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie you can go ahead and talk while we're putting our helmets and gloves on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we never got around to debriefing you on PDI, but the out of plane indications you saw on the AGS during descent were proper. We had changed your vector slightly just prior to PDI. And so the AGS were navigating and indicating properly. We just ran the present ascent targets in the LMS with the half a mile cross range is shown on the pad. And, you're going to be steering south. That's the way the steering direction goes that's to your left for Geno's benefit. And, the crosspointer indicated a maximum of about 13 feet per second of plain velocity at about ignition plus 3 minutes and 50 seconds and then came on back to zero. Over. That velocity was AGS (garble).
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie that's good information to have. Understand the AGS on that one, okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo control coming up now on 18 minutes until lunar liftoff.
|AMERICA|(Garble) attitude.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America.
|PAO|And flight director Gene Kranz has just gone around the room checked with all flight controllers. We're go for lunar liftoff.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Ascent water is open, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|And we've now switched over to the water on the ascent stage to be used in cooling electronic equipment, as called for in the flight plan. There was some concern that we would run out of descent water before we switched over to ascent water, but the water in the descent stage lasted as long as it was required.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston, we're at liftoff minus 17 minutes and verb 47 is going over.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|America, we see your cabin at 5.5.

|CAPCOM|That's affirmative keep it like it is.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Terminator's coming up, Geneo. We got light and everything we need.
|PAO|This is Apollo control. We show the lunar module, Challenger, in an orbit of 47.9 by 9.3 nautical miles now. The CSM in a nearly circular 62 nautical mile orbit. The flight dynamics officer at this time is working up the information that will be used by the lunar module crew in their terminal phase initiation maneuver that puts the lunar module on an intersecting orbit with the command module to be performed with the ascent propulsion system engine.
|CHALLENGER|Probably because of (garble) or something.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, anytime you want them. Okay, ready 188.
|CHALLENGER|Hello Houston. Challenger has a visual on America at about 112 miles.
|CAPCOM|Okay and Americas just called. I don't know if you heard him. He hasn't got you in the sextant yet. You might check light on. He is getting a VHF marks. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay light is on. Okay 55 and 5700. That1s good.
|PAO|That was Jack Schmitt confirming visual acquisition of the command module about 112 miles away.
|CHALLENGER|The AGS saw that out of plane Geneo.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, this is Houston. I have a MS FN TP I for you.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay Delta-VX is a plus 74.0 Y plus 3.9 and Z plus 9.0. Delta-V total is 74.7 and for once they didn't give us the breaking, Jack.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, plus 74.0 plus 3.9 plus 9.0 and total 74.0.
|CAPCOM|That total is 74.7.
|CHALLENGER|Sorry. Okay 74.7.
|CHALLENGER|I'm working on my third mark.
|CHALLENGER|And Houston, Challenger. I still have a visual on America.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'm sure Ron's problem is he is looking into the Sun.
|CHALLENGER|That's right because he's sunlit up there.
|AMERICA|Yes, you are correct Houston.
|CAPCOM|Challenger we'd like ASC OMNI now.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, going ASC.
|CHALLENGER|America, how do you read Challenger?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 17:12 GET 188:19 756/2
188:19:00|CHALLENGER|He's not he turned his VHF off. You want it on?
|AMERICA|I'm reading you relay now Challenger. This is America.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's fine, Ron.
|AMERICA|Let me know when you want a voice - VHF voice check there and we'll make sure we go to VHF.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and we're holding you at 93 miles right now.
|AMERICA|Roger, at about 92.7 which is probably delay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and you just went into darkness up there. I lost you.
|AMERICA|Should be able to see you now, then.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, we're also in darkness.
|AMERICA|That's orange, you sure you got your track ing light up?
|CHALLENGER|That's affirm. I can see it flashing. we'do have our tracking light on.
|AMERICA|See it flashing?
|CHALLENGER|Yes, I see a reflection on - -
|AMERICA|Ah, I see - can't see you in the telescope but I got you right in the sextant.
|CHALLENGER|Good. Outstanding babe.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. No update on your LM weight.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, understand. No update on the weight.
|AMERICA|And Houston. I'm going to accept that because he was about one degree almost an inch of the sextant.
|CHALLENGER|Houston can you tell Challenger what's wrong with the high gain.
|CAPCOM|Stand by Challenger for America to go ahead and accept that one.
|AMERICA|Okay, broght him right in. This is America, brought him right into the center.

|CAPCOM|Jack, you're loud and clear. Looks good.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, I don't know what broke lock. Did you read us all through ascent. We had some uplink signal strength1, ,
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. We read you loud and clear all the way. We haven't figured it out either.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we had a loud uplink squeal on all
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|On all, on OMNI1s as well as high gain.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|That's steerable. Excuse me. Okay Gordy, Challenger's state vector is locked in with the raw data. We ve got twelve marks going for us now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|And Houston, can we have an LOS time, pleaser
|CAPCOM|Yes. Stand by. Challenger, LOS should be 188:51:15.
|CHALLENGER|Roger. 51:15.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We now show America leading Challenger by about 78 nautical miles. The two vehicles closing at about 300 feet per second. And we have about 21 minutes now remaining before we lose contact with the Command Module and we'll lose the LM, which is in a lower orbit 1 minute earlier than that. Shortly after disappearing behind the Moon and shortly after we lose radio contact with the two vehicles, they'll be performing the terminal phase initiate maneuver from the Lunar Module. That will be a burn using the ascent propulsion system engine, a 3500 pound thrust engine imparting an increase in velocity about 74.7 feet per second. This maneuver will place the LM on an intersecting trajectory with the CSM for rendezvous.
|CHALLENGER|America, Challenger. We got you now just under 72 miles and we're 279 feet per second closing.
|AMERICA|Okay, got you. 71 miles1,
|AMERICA|Hello Challenger, America. You still there. I lost all my noise.
|CHALLENGER|Affirmed. We're still here.
|CHALLENGER|And we're on our flight. We're coming right up beside you.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. For your information, the (garble) that we, that you probably saw during ascent was, we think, in the PNGS. The AGS is okay. It's probably a slight juice up to the rear of the PNGS.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy. Understand.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 188:28 CST 17:22 MC757/2
188:28:00|CAPCOM|Challenger and America, Houston. If that noise, which is due to low signal strength on America is bothering anyone, we could break down the relay and let you talk to each other VHF. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Yes sir Houston. This is Challenger. Let's break down the relay and America, let's go VHF.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, America. I'm on VHF.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, good.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston. We have America on VHF.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|I still got your echo there Challenger. This is America.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Gordy, you want to give us an explanation of the ascent engine garble) problem.
|CAPCOM|Let me get that story myself. We're still looking at the data. Try to have one for you before we lose you at least the next time around we will.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Yes. Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|How many marks you got?
|CHALLENGER|35.5. Okay. Go ahead.
|CHALLENGER|Go. Go.
|CHALLENGER|Well, I'm not very at Z. 15 feet per second difference. But it agrees with the AGS, if that makes you feel any better.
|CHALLENGER|Hello, Houston. You were looking at our NOUN 81 on the recycle. That's 17 marks.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Challenger. And what it was on the APS there we saw an indication, probably due to a temperature shift, which was a possible indication of unbalanced of propellant usage there. And it was sort of confirmed by an increase in the (garble, garble, garble), so we just played the conservative thing and terminated ascent speed.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordy. Thank you. I was just curious as to exactly what it was.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 17:30 CST 188:37 GET 758/1
188:37:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Gordie. Thank you. I was just curious exactly what it was.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and it's no problem for our TPI on the APS.
|CHALLENGER|Understand.
|AMERICA|Okay, Challenger, America. I got the NOUN 81 for you to recycle.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|I agree with you pretty well.
|CAPCOM|Outstanding.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I say TPI is about 4.9 off 5 feet per second.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Let's try the high gain, pitch zero, yaw 30, manual and wide and leave it In manual.
|AMERICA|Who relayed to me? I can't hear 'em (garbled).
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead, Houston. This is Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, would you relay to America to try the high gain, pitch zero, yaw 30, manual and wide.
|CHALLENGER|You want pitch zero, yaw at 30, manual and wide. That's pitch zero, yaw 30, manual and wide.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's affirmative.
|AMERICA|(garbled)
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston. He's still working at it .
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 39 minutes. The noise we're getting on the communications circuits right now is coming from the CSM link and we hope to improve that by getting the command module in operation on it's high gain antenna, which will increase our signal strength and should cut down the noise quite a bit.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston, over.
|AMERICA|Houston, America. How do you read me?
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead, Houston. This is Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Standby. America we just barely read you. Go ahead.
|AMERICA|Okay, just a second, I can read you loud and clear now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're readable. For Challenger. The MSFN V was kinda weak. We're expecting more like a plus 20 for the Delta V - V solution for TPI and that's what all the airborne systems seem to be converging on. Over.
|CHALLENGER|That sounds right. We prepared that way up here. Glad to hear that. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Roger.

|CHALLENGER|Yes, this is just normal procedure. I'm rolling 180.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're about 2 minutes to LOS. All1. the solutions look good to us. I guess if we apply the voting logic we go with the PGNS. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we've already decided that we are going to go with the PGNS. All the solutions look good on our onboard comparisons, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|This is Apollo control. We've had loss of signal now from the LM and about 1 more minute we'll lose contact with Ron Evans aboard the command module America. As the two vehicles go behind the Moon on the 51st revolution. Challenger, will be performing the terminal phase initiation maneuver in about 4 minutes 30 seconds. This maneuver computed onboard and the time of ignition and ground elapsed time will be 188 hours 55 minutes 57 seconds. This burn again performed with the ascent propulsion system engine a very short burn between 2 and 3 seconds in duration. And when last we had data from the lunar module radar it showed Challenger 39 miles behind America closing at a rate of about a hundred feet per second. And we've had loss of signal now from the command module. We'll be reacquireing vehicles in about 45 minutes. And at that time Challenger should be closing with America going through the final breaking prior to station keeping leading up to docking. The following is a statement from the President of the United Stated of America. As the Challenger leaves the surface of the Moon we are conscience not of what we leave behind, but of what lies before us. The dreams that draw humanity forward seem always to be redeemed if we believe in them strongly enough and pursue them with diligence and courage. Once we stood
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 17:39 GET 188:46 759/2
188:46:00|PAO|mystified by the stars today we reach up to them. we'do this not only because it is mans destiny to dream the impossible, to dare the impossible and to do the impossible. But aj.so, because in space as on Earth there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement and the enlargement of human existance. This may be the last time in this century that men will walk on the Moon, but space exploration will continue. The benefits of space exploration wiH continue. The search for knowledge through the exploration of space will continue, and there will be new dreams to pursue based on what we have learned. So let us not mistake the significance nor miss the majesty of what we have witnessed. Few events have ever marked so clearly the passage of history from one epoch to another. If we understand this about the last flight of Apollo then truly we shall have touched a many splendored thing.

188:58:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 59 minutes. About 2 minutes 45 seconds ago, Challenger should have performed the terminal phase initiation maneuver that will put the LM on an intersecting trajectory with the Command Module. We would like to recapitulate the lunar liftoff which was nearly normal in all respects. The liftoff occurred at Ground Elapsed Time of 188 hours 1 minute 36 seconds and shut down occurred 7 minutes 20 seconds, both as predicted. The onboard guidance system, the primary guidance system of the LM calculated an initial orbit of 48 by 9 nautical miles. Correction of 50 by 9 nautical miles, and on the ground we calculated an orbit agreeing very closely with that of 48 by 9. The CSM at this time in an orbit 62 nautical miles circular, nearly circular. There was a period of time during the early phase of the liftoff, at pitchover, which occurs at about 10 seconds when we lost tracking data. This loss of data lasted for about 3 minutes. Now later in the powered ascent, there was a period of time when the crew aboard Challenger was not receiving voice communications from the Control Center, although we were receiving communications from the LM and we were relaying messages through the Command Module to the Lunar Module. And we'don't have an assessment of what caused that problem at this time. We expect to get further information on that later. We'll be reacquiring the vehicles in about 35 minutes as they come back around on the front side of the Moon on the 52nd revolution for the Command Module, America. At 189 hours 1 minute, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 18:27 GET 189:33 MC-761/1
189:33:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 189 hours, 34 minutes. We're about 2 minutes now from reacquiring the spacecraft, America and Challenger. At the time we reacquire, the two vehicles should be about 7 miles apart with Challenger behind and below the Command Module, closing at the rate of about 5 feet per second. As they pass out over the front side of the Moon, approaching the landing site at about 190 hours ground elapsed time, they should be in position for docking. And we expect to have television of that event. Docking is unlike some trajectory events not constrained to occur at a specific time, but depends on when the crew feels that they have everything aligned up properly and in a position to move in and dock. But we would expect that we would be fairly close to that time of 190 hours ground elapsed time.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston. America here.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America. You're loud and clear.
|AMERICA|Okay, do you have me on the tube.
|CAPCOM|Not yet, Ron. I'll let you kn ow.
|PAO|And we have a good television picture.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston, we are reading you loud and clear, we're at 1 mile and I just broke into 30 feet per second. TPI was nominal.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger, that' s good news.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, and the midcourses were all less than 1.6 feet per second.and we're at .8 miles now, 5000 feet.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, our next breaking gate, is 3000 feet.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I've got a plan form, I can see the Command and Service Module now.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|We are at 4200 feet and 30 feet per second. And inertial line of sites are both 0.
|CAPCOM|America and Challenger, this is Houston, We've got a good picture of the Challenger coming up from the surface of the Moon.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) It's coming straight up, all right.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ron. Coming up to 3000 feet, I'm going to break off to 20.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Hold on, here we go.
|CHALLENGER|And, we're 2500 feet and 20.7 feet per second.
|CHALLENGER|15 on 110.

|AMERICA|Okay, you're looking good.
|CHALLENGER|Coming up at at - under 114 - 116 degrees. 1900 feet 20 feet1per second.
|AMERICA|Okay, quarter of a mile, I got you.
|CHALLENGER|I can see your thrusters firing now, Ron. We're at 1500 feet and breaking.
|AMERICA|Okay.

189:40:00|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ron, we're at 1200 feet and 8.8 feet per second.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's about right. Concur.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, you do have a stub of an antenna out there on the same side as the VHF antenna's on.
|AMERICA|Yeah, how far is it sticking out?
|CHALLENGER|I can't tell yet, but about -- from where I am, about a third of the way — a third of the length of the VHF antenna.
|AMERICA|Oh, that's not very far.
|CHALLENGER|No. Okay, we're at 970 feet. 800 feet and we're at 8.8 feet per second.
|AMERICA|Looks like Challenger's in good shape. I don't see anything hanging down or anything.
|CHALLENGER|She's in excellent shape. Okay, we're at 650 feet and 8,8.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|God, you look pretty. Yeah, you just got a small stub, Ron. Probably not more than a couple of feet.
|CHALLENGER|600 feet, breaking to 5.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I've got 5.0, and I'm at 520 feet.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I'm closing at 5 feet per second, 440 feet.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Good to see you.
|AMERICA|Good to have you all back up here.
|CHALLENGER|It's been a good trip. Staying at 5 feet per second and 350 feet.
|PAO|Challenger's coming in with the crew in the — nearly heads down position as seen on the television monitor.
|CHALLENGER|Just great. Okay, Ron, 240 feet and 3 feet per second.
|AMERICA|Okay, keep her coming. Nice and easy. Getting lots of pictures.
|CHALLENGER|200 feet, 3 feet per second. I got 2 feet per second, and I'm at 170 feet.
|CHALLENGER|140 feet and 2 feet per second. About three feet of that antenna Ron, and we'll get a better look at it when you pitch over.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Everything else looks clean.
|AMERICA|That Challenger's a beautiful vehicle.
|CHALLENGER|You betcha.
|AMERICA|One little strap flapping on the top of it, and that's all.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I've got 2 feet per second, I'm at 100.
|AMERICA|Hey, Houston. You can see that strap flopping up there now on the TV, but that's the only thing. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 18:32 GET 189:40 MC762/2
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Ron, we haven't picked it out, but we'do have a perfect picture,
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I'm sneaking in at about a little over 1 foot per second.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm trying to keep you on the tube here, so —
|AMERICA|(Laughter) How come you guys do every thing upside down?
|CHALLENGER|Okay, let's let it drift in like this slowly.
|AMERICA|Okay. You still have it*
|CHALLENGER|I've still got it.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I'm going to stop it here, and you can do your maneuver.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'm station keeping on you.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'll do my VERB 49.
|CHALLENGER|Seem okay, Jack?
|CHALLENGER|Oh, I gotta get a picture here, too.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, will do, stand by.
|CHALLENGER|Took a couple of pictures here. Got 'em. 253 — 319, 254, and zoom.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you ready, Jack?
|CHALLENGER|(Garble)
|CHALLENGER|Okay, here we go. Mark it. In a minute.
|CHALLENGER|Yeah, I'm going to get the radar out of the way, but I'm not going — I'll lose him here as soon as his (garble) gets out.
|CHALLENGER|I want to just station keep.
|CHALLENGER|Roger, probe looks good. I can see it e xtended.
|AMERICA|Okay, great.
|CHALLENGER|Radar holds you — well, we'don't hold you anymore.
|PAO|Ron Evans will now maneuver the CSM into position for the final docking.
|CHALLENGER|Radar's being stowed now, Ron.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, we'd like OMNI Delta, please.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, America and Challenger - a good tight Navy formation.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Geno.
|PAO|We've switched to one of the OMNI dir ectional antennas on the command module, and we won't have television back until we get back on the high gain antenna, which should be shortly.
|CHALLENGER|Antenna is nothing more than your EVA light out there.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 18:32 GET 189:40 MC762/3
189:40:00|CHALLENGER|From where I was, it looked like it was coming out the other side, but I think you're clean.
|AMERICA|Okay. But, now the one I'm concerned about is on the side from the EVA antenna.
|CHALLENGER|No, uh uh, you were clean over there.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay.
|AMERICA|The bottom of your vehicle's got a bunch of tinfoil on it,1it's a little bit scorched, but it's all intact, as far as1-- much as I can tell.
|CHALLENGER|This bird is good enough to fly again.
|CHALLENGER|Yes sir. I'll even (garble).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 189:48 CST 18:40 MC763/1
189:48:00|CHALLENGER|How (garble, garble)
|AMERICA|I got 60 per cent left.
|AMERICA|Say I like to fly.
|CHALLENGER|You in your maneuver, Ron?
|AMERICA|Yes. It's maneuvering now.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'm going to go ahead and take a peak at your SIM bay up here.
|AMERICA|I know.
|PAO|Our instrumentation and communications engi neer estimates that it will be 10 to 12 minutes before reposition to get the high gain antenna and television back.
|CHALLENGER|Film okay, Jack. Film okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we're getting pretty close now. About another 5 degrees roll is OFF. Can you see it?
|CHALLENGER|Yes.
|CHALLENGER|How does the mapping camera look? Should be all covered up.
|CHALLENGER|Stand by.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|I think I'll fly over there and take a look at it.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Sun's shining right in it.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ron. It looks intact here. There's one cover.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. Over.
|CHALLENGER|It's got a cover on the right hand side.
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|We'd like you take a special look at the pan camera and see if you think maybe the lens is not completely stowed. Over1.
|CHALLENGER|No ah, I'm looking at this thing upside down. There's the sub, give me the location again of the pan camera Houston.
|CAPCOM|It's a round barrel type object, approximately right in the center of the SIM bay.
|CHALLENGER|It's just, if you're standing in the shoes, the pan camera would be right in front of you.
|CHALLENGER|It's stowed, it's flush.
|CHALLENGER|There's one door open, Ron. If you were standing in the shoes it's at the bottom hand, bottom left hand side of the SIM bay.
|AMERICA|Bottom left hand side, you're standing in the shoes.
|CHALLENGER|Yes. It looks like two covers open there. Doesn't it Jack.
|AMERICA|Yes. Okay, well that's part of the mapping
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 189:48 CST 18:40 MC763/2
189:48:00|AMERICA|camera, bottom of that door that pushes open by itself.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, well that's the only thing that's open. Everything is flush.
|AMERICA|Okay, you think, is that a door that extends, If you're standing in the shoes, that extends out the bottom of the SIM bay or one that extends out, If you're standing on the shoes, extending on the left side of the SIM bay?
|CHALLENGER|Yes. It extends out the left side toward the front of the spacecraft down in the bottom left hand corner, If you're standing in the shoes.
|AMERICA|Yes. Okay. Yes that's the one that the camera pushes open by itself.
|CHALLENGER|Okay. Well that's good. I can't see anything that's abnorma1 down there. Everything's covered, everything's flushed.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston. Over.
|AMERICA|Houston, were you calling America?
|CHALLENGER|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Some more words on Identifying whether the pan camera is stowed or not. The pan camera, as Ron said, is right in front of the shoes™ And if it's stowed, well if it's not stowed properly, you should be able to see the lens or probably part of it. And if it's fully stowed there'll be just a plain faced barrel facing outward. Silver colored. Over.
|CHALLENGER|It's stowed, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It sounds good,
|CHALLENGER|It's got to be. There's nothing , it's stowed.
|CHALLENGER|Let me take one more look.
|CHALLENGER|The only thing abnormal is the service module plates, just forward plus next to the SIM bay are all blistered. It's forward of those EVA hand holds,
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy that. Our concern, or the reason we're asking about the pan camera is we have a higher than normal temperatures in the pan camera and we were concerned whether it was either not completely stowed or maybe there's a heater stuck on. We'll check a heater out later on here.
|CHALLENGER|I'm going around the other side here a little bit, but it's. We have a long barrel, through the center down the XX axis, deep into the SIM bay, then you have a little barrel oh about 3 inches, 2 or 3 inches, like about a 500 millimeter lens on a Hasselblad, sticking straight up, perpendicular to SIM bay and it's well flushed. It's inside the box that it's next to.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 189:48 CST 18:40 MC763/3
189:48:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Jim.
|CHALLENGER|Yes. It's normal. There's nothing that's unstowed in that thing.
|CAPCOM|Challenger, America, that's good on the inspection from questions from here anyway. Clear to continue and proceed with docking.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|AMERICA|It is unbelievable.
|CHALLENGER|This is the greatest flight in the world, Ron.
|AMERICA|Can you see me.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, I can see you. Right in there.
|CHALLENGER|Reach out and tickle your probe.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, let's get, let's get this business going. Let's get in a docking attitude.
|AMERICA|Okay, we'll maneuver to the docking attitude here.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I can also see where your HF comes out on this side, and it's flush with the box. It's completely stowed.
|AMERICA|Okay, well that's the one that we think hid the one on that side, the other side is the one that we are a little concerned with. we'don't worry about it.
|CHALLENGER|It's so true,
|AMERICA|Oh, Okay.
|CHALLENGER|We were over there.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|And I'm maneuvering back to a docking atti tude .
|CHALLENGER|Your high gain is not pointing at the Earth, though, I don't believe.
|AMERICA|Oh, we're not using it yet. It's pointing where the Earth will be when we maneuver back around.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|AMERICA|Another one from there.
|CHALLENGER|I'd try 11 and 8. That's what I'm doing.
|CHALLENGER|Right.
|CHALLENGER|We took a punch (garble).
|CHALLENGER|Guess I ought to pull my radar breakers, now that it's s towed.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, can you see my logic yet. Or you want to wait until the high gain? This is America,
|CAPCOM|Oh, we can see it now Ron. We can do it now.
|AMERICA|Okay, Logic 1. Mark it. Logic 2. Mark it.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you're GO for pyro 1.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Backing off here a little bit Ron. Give you a chance to maneuver.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 18:50 GET 189:58 764/1
189:58:00|CHALLENGER|Hey Jack, what are we forgetting. Let's see the high gain or the rendezvous radar is stowed and as soon as he gets his attitude I'll get to mine.
|CHALLENGER|Looks like you've been flying well up there pardnor. The spacecraft looks good.
|AMERICA|Oh, you betcha. CHALLENGER  How, far you got to go on your maneuvers?
|AMERICA|About another 60 degrees of roll, yet, and about 10 degrees pitch.
|PAO|Ron Evans now maneuvering America into position for the docking. The final few feet of the docking maneuver performed with the command module because of the better visibility from that vehicle.
|CAPCOM|Give us OMNI alpha.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ron I can confirm your other HF antenna is stowed.
|AMERICA|Okay, good, thank you.
|AMERICA|Okay, the PYRO's are on.
|AMERICA|Sorry, but I'm out of film in the DAC. You guys will just have to -
|CHALLENGER|No problem.
|AMERICA|- be on TV (laughter).
|CHALLENGER|No problem. Let's just get in attitude and get those capture latches in that drogue.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ron, the high gain angles look good. Go NARROW and REACQ and we should have you.
|AMERICA|Okay. I'm in attitude Gene.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, let me position so I can get in attitude.
|CAPCOM|And America and Challenger we got a beautiful picture once again.
|CHALLENGER|Very good Gordie we're happy to give it to you. This worked out great Ron.
|AMERICA|Yes, it sure did.
|CHALLENGER|Null PGNS and then I'll give it to you shortly.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Ron you've got It.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, you've got it I'm going into my maneuver.
|AMERICA|I've got It.
|CHALLENGER|And that's the landing site down there. We pitched right through the landing site.
|AMERICA|we'did.
|CHALLENGER|Yes.
|AMERICA|Well good. (Laughter).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 18:50 GET 189:58 764/2

|CHALLENGER|No, don't get (garble).
|AMERICA|Yes, (laughter).
|AMERICA|Well, the drogue is still in there.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I've got you right off the overhead, Ron, now I'm going1to yaw.
|AMERICA|Okay, yaw her around.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, here we go. What a super flying mach ine.
|AMERICA|Still looks kind of tinny to me.
|CHALLENGER|He's not going to have to do anything, but thrust right into - I might even get your roll angle zero for you by this maneuver. Okay, it's all yours.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) okay I've got her.
|CHALLENGER|Should be looking — I'm looking right up your window.
|AMERICA|I got to translate through sideways a little bit here1The trouble is I'm looking right into the S un .
|CHALLENGER|Yes. Change these focus to 60. Okay, Jack let's go over1that thing again. We got anything else to do.
|CHALLENGER|Well, you're at the attitude. We're waiting to confirm1capture and then you just mode control off.
|CHALLENGER|Let me get out of the way.
|CHALLENGER|We can do it babe, keep it coming.
|AMERICA|Okay, she's looking alright.
|CHALLENGER|Command module looks just as good as the day they put it on1the pad.
|AMERICA|And you know so does Challenger by gosh. Your missing some of the pieces.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, one big piece we left behind.
|CHALLENGER|Yes, right.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, I guess I'd estimate you about 12 or 15 feet.
|AMERICA|Yes, that's about right.
|CHALLENGER|Got my reticle coming right in the rendezvous window.
|AMERICA|Okay, she ought to be coming right in there.
|CHALLENGER|Looking good, you're stable as a rock.
|CHALLENGER|Bet I'll be able to get it with that.
|CHALLENGER|Give me a little warning on capture Ron, so I can go free.
|AMERICA|Okay, try to.
|CHALLENGER|I can see all your docking latches. I can see half of them now but their all looking good.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 18:50 GET 189:58 764/3

|CAPCOM|America and Challenger, you're ...
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Gordy, we're not ...
|CAPCOM|Like to take a minute of your time here to read the following statement by the President of the United States of America. As the Challenger leaves the surface of the Moon, we are conscious, not of what we leave behind, but of what lies before us. The dreams that draw humanity forward seem always to be redeemed if we believe in them strongly enough and pursue them with diligence and courage. Once we stood mystified by the stars. Today we reach up to them. we'do this not only because it is man's destiny to dream the impossible, to dare the impossible, and to do the impossible, but also because in Space, as on Earth, there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement of ... Last time in this century that men will walk on the Moon, but Space exploration will continue. The benefits of Space exploration will continue and there will be new dreams to pursue, based on what we have learned. So let us not mistake the significance or miss the majesty of what we have witnessed. Few events have ever marked so clearly the passage of history from one epoch to another. If we understand this about the last flight of Apollo, then truly we shall have touched a many splendored thing. To Gene Cernan, Jack Schmitt, and Ron Evans, we say God speed you safely back to this good Earth.
|CHALLENGER|Gordon, those are beautiful words by a great American president. We're very honored to receive them, we're very honored to be able to serve our country in the way that we believe in. And we thank you. Thank you very much Gordy, and Mr. President.
|AMERICA|Mr. President, this is America and we appre ciate it very much. Thank you sir.
|CHALLENGER|Say, Houston, Challenger.
|CHALLENGER|Ron, would you give us a call, when the tunnel's pressurized?
|AMERICA|Okay. Stand by.
|CHALLENGER|And also, we'll need a call when you get the attitude.
|AMERICA|Okay. Will do.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 190:18 CST 19:12 MC766/2

|AMERICA|Okay, emergency cabin (garble) are off.
|CHALLENGER|Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Challenger.
|CHALLENGER|Roger. Give us a call when you want us to go through the COMM configuration, and we're going to leave the cabin fan on a little bit, keep airing out, filtering the cabin. And don't let us forget it.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston. I'm going to open the pressure equalization valve going into the tunnel. Can you keep an eye on my cabin pressure?
|CAPCOM|Roger, America. Will do.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, there's 2. Delta P is 2. Back closed and see if it stays.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. You need a PRO to get the V49 maneuver to jet attitude starter, don't we.
|AMERICA|Oh, sorry. (garble).
|CAPCOM|Ron, while you're down there, there's a cou ple switches on the SIM bay to check out this pan camera heater. Ove r.

|CAPCOM|Challenger, Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Pressure is okay, we'll go ahead and take her on down. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, when you get ready to transfer an OPS. We want you to transfer the commander's OPS. Over.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, we'll do.
|CHALLENGER|Gordie, were you able to see the lunar surface liftoff?
|CAPCOM|Yes sir, we certainly were. It was a beautiful picture and captain video stayed right on you. We saw you up to about two minutes into the burn. We could see the flow.
|SC|Oh, I'll tell you. If Challenger hits that south massif and you're anywhere pointing in the right direction you ought to have a spectacular shot.
|CAPCOM|I'm sure of that because that camera is as good as any I've seen in a television studio.
|SC|Okay, I've got about .2 on the Delta P. And the equalization valve's wide open so it must be about right.
|SC|Okay, emersion cabin pressures (garble)
|SC|Okay, we're going to open the hatch.
|SC|Ron, do you read?
|SC|What?
|SC|Yes, go ahead.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Yeah, I still got about five on the cabin I think. I got the hatch out yes, It's pressurized. Okay .
|SC|Okay, Ron it'll be a minute or two before we open that hatch. We got a little work to do in here.
|SC|I don't know what it's like (laughter). I guess it's great. Let me check the old docking latches.
|SC|Okay,
|SC|Okay, I hear you. And Houston, every latch worked perfectly.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, let's get the probe out of here.
|SC|I'm just bleeding the nitrogen out of the probe.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron and when you get back in the cabin next, we'll take pan camera power off.
|SC|Okay. The probes loose in there.
|CAPCOM|Sure sounds like it.
|SC|Is there any hurry on that Gordo?
|SC|Houston, this is America. Is there any hurry on that pan camera thing? If not I'll take the probe out . -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 19:21 GET 190:27 767/2
|CAPCOM|Negative, no hurry we have plenty of time here till LOS 14 minutes we want to see it before then.
|SC|Okay, I'll get it out before then.
|PAO|Evans will now remove the probe and drogue assembly and hand them through to Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan in the lunar module. He'll also be transfering in the vacuum cleaner and a list of other items that need to be transferred out of the LM into the command module. After, everything is cleaned up as possible in the LM cabin the crew will begin transferring samples and other equipment into the command module and getting - begin the process of getting transfered themselves from Challenger into America. We have about 13 minutes remaining before we lose radio contact with Apollo 17.

|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 190 hours 51 minutes. We've had loss of signal now with America and Challenger docked together in the 52nd revolution and we'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes. The current orbit for the two vehicles is 62.2 by 61.6, and they're currently at an altitude of about 62.2, very close to apogee at this time. This is Apollo Control Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 2026 GET 188:53 MC770/1
188:53:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 191 hours 34 min utes, about 1 minute away from reacquiring America and Challenger on the 53rd revolution of the Moon. During this front-side pass one of the major activities here in the Control Center and also aboard the spacecraft will be to get the lunar module Challenger properly configured for the LM jettison and the subsequent de-orbit burn that will impact at — into the lunar surface near the landing site at Taurus-Littrow. The Flight Dynamics Officer will be coming up with the numbers that will be programmed into the LM for that de-orbit jettison and subsequent de-orbit maneuver. Right now, we're looking a time for ignition, or rather, a time for separation of the LM of 193 hours 58 minutes, and a LM de-orbit burn at 195 hours 38 minutes 14 seconds. The LM will be jettisoned by severing pyrotechnic bolts that — pyrotechnic charges that in turn sever the connection between the two vehicles. And we have AOS. We'll pick up the live conversation.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) I've been sleeping floating around in the tunnel.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We hear you talking.
|AMERICA|Hey, okay, Houston.
|CHALLENGER|Hello, Houston, Challenger's up also.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger. Keeping busy up there?
|CHALLENGER|Yes sir, Gordo. I think we're moving right along with the transfer and stowage, and we'll give you a hack here. We got the ISA bag over for 82. We got the — two of the sample return bags stowed and a decon bag, and they're over in a lot of miscellaneous stuff.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|(Garble) probably, yeah.
|SC|Jack, is that —
|SC|What did that do, come lose sir?
|SC|Yeah, my whole book came lose.
|SC|You got something on there.
|SC|(Laughter) (garble) bag.
|SC|Thank you. I'm checking some of this stuff off.
|SC|Yeah?
|SC|That was a good one.
|SC|I didn't like (garble).
|SC|Okay, you going to put the Buddy/SLSS in the decon bag and stow it on A1?
|SC|That's in there now.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, ISA has got the — yeah.
|SC|You just took the ISA bag — the big —
|SC|Okay, but it had a lens brush, 16 millimeter mags, 3 of them?

|SC|Okay, so I got those in.
|SC|Garble
|SC|Okay, those 16 millimeter bags are in R-13? You have extra sample collection bags? You got two of those in here? In there? In the ISA?
|SC|I need another — yeah —
|SC|Okay.
|SC|I need another decontamination bag.
|SC|Got one that's got a metal plate in it somewhere.
|SC|That's it right there. That's got a metal p 1 a te.
|SC|Yeah, that goes in the BGA bag, I think.
|SC|Huh?
|SC|That goes in the BGA bag.
|SC|(Laughter) Oh, boy, I had a pretty nice little home here by myself.
|SC|You got to go (garble).
|SC|I'm out of bags, I think.
|SC|How you doing down there?
|SC|Good to be back.
|SC|Yep.

|SC|Yep.
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|I'd —I don't even know what's going on in the flight plan. Let's see.
|SC|This .
|SC|This, I think, isn't it?
|SC|Hey, what time is it. Let's see — 191:40. Ah, let me check.
|SC|One hour from now.
|SC|What?
|SC|One hour from now.
|SC|No, no, we haven't (garble).
|SC|One hour from now, it's suppose to be.
|SC|Okay, let me get some out.
|SC|We'll be working (garble) I guess.
|SC|Guess it doesn't make any difference which one goes where, does it?
|SC|Jack, (garble) tangled up in the vacuum cleaner cable.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We heard you talking about the time there. As far as we can tell, you're right on the time line.
|SC|Timeline (garble)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 20:26 GET 188:53 MC770/3
188:53:00|SC|Right on the timeline, huh? Aren't we supposed to be closed out in about an hour?
|CAPCOM|Well, let's see —
|SC|That right? Or not?
|CAPCOM|Ron, it's about an hour and a half until you're supposed to close up the LM hatch.
|SC|Okay. An hour and a half yet. Yeah, we should get it by then, I hope.
|SC|Hey, Gene, do those SRC's have numbers on them, or weights, or anything like that?
|SC|(Garble).
|SC|Both weigh the same?
|SC|Yeah. Almost.

|SC|Yes, that's alright. Well, it's serial number 1007 is in the B6 rock box area. I don't know how you tell which ones the number which numbers what.
|SC|Just a second I can't get the other one closed. No, I don't mean that one. I mean the B5 rock box.
|SC|Oops, I got the B6 back again. (laughter), yes I'll take it. Okay, there's a neat way to pass things back and forth. Okay, that's alright we'll keep - okay. Let me look - no.
|SC|You guys still got your PGA pockets on? Oh, okay. You didn't want any of the stuff that's in them? Oh (laughte r).
|SC|You guys got some sample bags your putting A9?
|SC|You got a sample bag for me to put in A9?
|SC|No.
|SC|Youdon't.
|SC|Oh, wait a minute.
|SC|Okay. No, I just got an empty box.
|SC|Oh okay.
|SC|No, it just goes in an lithium hydroxide canis ter.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|You want the canister? It's easier to just put the bag in the thing over here, I think.
|SC|What's that? Okay, that's alright I'll get it. (Laughter) doesn't look like it's going to fit. Yes, it's number 7. Well, maybe it will fit. Oh, it fits. Sample bag number 7 is in A9.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 191:52 CST 20:45 MC772/1
191:52:00|CHALLENGER|You know, from the looks of that dirt, no wonder it looks dark down there at that landing site.
|CHALLENGER|No, we're going to keep them all. We're taking them back.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|What do you mean. Unused ones.
|AMERICA|I don't know what this is all about.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|We're getting a one way bit of communications here apparently with Ron Evans, whose mike is on voice operated, voice operated mode. Triggered by his own speech and Jack Schmitt and Gene Cernan in the Lunar Module apparently operating their microphones in the push to talk mode.
|CHALLENGER|Weight those yet?
|AMERICA|Yes.
|CHALLENGER|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And we hear Evans whenever he speaks to them, but we only hear the Lunar Module crew when they press the push to talk switch on their mike. Interesting to note that when Evans' mike is open, you can hear the vacuum cleaner operating in the background, presumeably in the Lunar Module, where Cernan and Schmitt are facing the monumental job of cleaning up the LM cabin, the things that are being transfered into the Command Module, and the same job is going to have to be done in part in the Command Module, from all the dirt that will be tracked in from the LM and from the rock containers that are moved into the CSM for stowage.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay. Here.
|CHALLENGER|Hey, Ron, can you use that?
|AMERICA|We can probably always use that you know.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, I'll send it over to you.
|AMERICA|Yes.
|AMERICA|Hey, Houston. How was the quality of America's TV camera. That's the first time, chance we had to use it on this flight.
|CAPCOM|I don't think it could have been any better. We had a real nice picture.
|AMERICA|Hey, okay. Good.
|AMERICA|Never did find that one set that you were talking about.
|AMERICA|Send the tape over here. You want it? Yes.
|CHALLENGER|Here's your ...
|AMERICA|Okay. AMEEICA1Okay, you can come up.
|AMERICA|No, we only have about 6 more sleeping pills left. Or 7 or something. I don't know.
|AMERICA|I don't like them. Sleep about one more p robably.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 192:01 CST 20:54 MC 773/1
192:01:00|SC|(Laughter) You want in? Okay, just a second. Okay. Watch that bag. Oh, the big one. You'll have to have a bigger hole than this to get it through. (Laughter) Okay.
|SC|Okay, Houston, this is Challenger. I think we're getting close to being able to take your uplink.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger. We're ready when you are.
|SC|Okay, you got (garbled) data.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I also got the pads checked.
|SC|(Garbled) in R2. I don't think I'll ever find it in here. What does it look - is it a small book or what? Hey, Gordy, it looks like we got - we've got data card book stowed away and can you read each of the items and I'll copy down the pad that way.
|SC|Hey, wait a minute and I'll tell you (garbled) Jack.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, Jack, no problem. It's not that complicated anyway.
|SC|That's right, this is an easy one. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It's a LM deorbit pad and NOUN 33 or TIG is 195 38 1300. NOUN 81 X is a minus 002246. Y is a plus 00569. And Z is a plus 01677. The Apogee and perigee are — perigee is going to be minus. And Delta VR is 02860. Burn time will be 158, and the FDAI attitude for what it Is worth here is 048 138 and 075. Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, here's the deorbit pad. TIG 195 38 1300; Delta V's are X minus 002246; Y is plus 00569; Z is plus 01677. Total Delta V is 02860, burn time 158; and FDAI angle is 048 138 075.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's all correct.
|SC|Okay, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|You will need a LM weight for the DAP if you want to write that one down it's a 5185.
|SC|Okay, 5185 is the LM weight.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|I never did get the purse back over here yet. It's in here. You don't need it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I think that's all the stuff - think that's all the junk. Well, the - you know we have more than enough to eat everyday - the only food that's left is the - you know the food that's to come up. We got more yellow pills than we know what to do with. You do? Okay. Yeah. But that food that we'didn't eat, it's gone. What did you do with it? In that big bag. (Laughter)
|PAO|The big yellow pills that Ron Evans was referring to are the germicidal pills that are mixed with the food after it has been - the astronauts have
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 192:01 CST 20:54 MC 773/2
192:01:00|PAO|eaten what they want the remnant is mixed with the germicical pill and stored* The pill prevents the bacteria build up and the subsequent build up of odors and so on in the spacecraft. The last series of numbers passed up to the crew included the time of ignition for the lunar module deorbit burn. And the parameters that will be fed into the LM guidance system to control that burn. The result of which will be to impact the lunar module into the lunar surface generating seismic waves.
|SC|That's your helmet over there, right? Yeah. Okay, because I've only got 2 helmets here.
|PAO|The LM deorbit burn is now scheduled to be performed at ground elapsed time of 195 hours 38 minutes 13 seconds. This will be a 158 second burn, using the reaction control system thrusters on the lunar' module and the burn will be controlled by the lunar module primary guidance and navigation system. With a total Delta V of 286 feet per second.
|SC|You want to make sure you got those -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 CST 21:04 GET 192:11 774/1
|SC|Okay.
|PAO|The deorbit burn will give us a predicted impact time of 195 hours 57 minutes 12 seconds. And the predicted latitude and longitude for impact is 19.95 degrees north 30.57 degrees east.
|SC|How about the monocular.
|SC|Yeah, I got it in my pocket.
|SC|Okay it's in your pocket.
|SC|You need that?
|SC|What is it?
|SC|Just a big bag.
|SC|No, I don't need it.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|(Garble) okay.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|If that's a good one, you just need one. Okay1,
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|Is a mag dog dog for LM jet on the 16 millimeter?
|CAPCOM|I'll check that. One other thing we'd like a H2 tank 1 fan on. Now to start getting it set up for the sleep period.
|SC|Okay. Just a second here. I'm stuck (laughter). Oh, Mr. Clean. You guys are so dirty. I'm going to make you sleep in the tunnel. Let's see H2 -
|CAPCOM|H2 tank 1.
|SC|Tank 1?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, tank 1 fan.
|SC|Okay, to on?
|CAPCOM|That's right on.
|SC|Okay, H2 tank 1 fan is on.

|SC|Okay the old CMC making a big hatch right there in the middle of things. There it is. Okay, you've got accept?
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey you guys keep the bag up there. I'll get the rest of it .
|SC|We keep the bag.
|SC|Yes.
|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston. The answer to your ques tion is yes mag delta delta is the one.
|SC|Delta Delta okay.
|CAPCOM|Shoot the whole thing, Ron.
|SC|Thank you. Get in there in a minute. Let's see.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 192:21 CST 21:14 MC775/1
192:21:00|AMERICA|Okay. Wait a minute. You're stuck on something. Okay., got it. Okay, I got it. You want the tape? The tape. Gene wants the tape.
|CHALLENGER|Yes. I'll need it.
|CAPCOM|Ron, Houston. If Delta delta is more than 50 per cent finished, then use Charlie Charlie.
|AMERICA|Okay. I don't think I've used Delta Delta, have I? I'11 have to look at it and see.
|CAPCOM|Ron, one other thing to bug you, we'd like you'd to do the V48 load as shown in the flight plan. It'll claps a dead ban so we can check and make sure the LM steerable is right on the money.
|AMERICA|You want to do that now?
|CAPCOM|That is affirmative.
|AMERICA|Okay, why don't you read it to me, Gordo. And i'll get it, LAB DSKY down here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's a V48 R-l, you want 61101.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston. This is America. I should have clasped it there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. That caught what we wanted.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Yes. The jettison suited. Okay, Houston, mag Delta Delta looks like it's full. I was just going over the list of stuff here I got. And I think you've got everything.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, I guess we're GO or NO/GO for your LM closeout.
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by 1 on that.

|CHALLENGER|Hello, Houston, Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Challenger.
|CHALLENGER|Gordo, how soon is LOS?
|CAPCOM|Okay, LOS is 16 and one-half minutes.
|CHALLENGER|That's for LOS. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, I have a couple up dates to go in the flight plan.
|AMERICA|Ah, yep.
|CHALLENGER|(garbled)
|AMERICA|Oh, okay.
|AMERICA|Houston, I'm ready for the flight plan update.
|CAPCOM|Okay, what it is is the CSM and LM weights for the dap at 192 10.
|AMERICA|Okay, go.
|CAPCOM|The CSM weight with 3 men, assuming you're going to have 3 men from here on out, is 36 545. And the LM weight is 5185. And you might jot down a couple trims for 3 men aboard. Pitch trim will be plus 0.60 and yaw plus 0.81.
|AMERICA|Okay, CSM weight is 36545, LM weight is 5185, pitch is plus 0.60, yaw is plus .81.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's a good readback. The LM jettison numbers are nominal as shown down the LM jettison time for TIG and attitudes.
|AMERICA|Okay, wait a minute.
|CAPCOM|I realize there is no -
|AMERICA|19403 30.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's right for CSM SEP and the LM jettison time is on a page before the 193 58 30.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CHALLENGER|Okay, Houston, Challenger is going off the air.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Challenger. It's been a pleasure talking to you the last few days.
|CHALLENGER|It seems like an unfitting finish to a super bird, but it's got one more job to do.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that.
|CHALLENGER|Take care, and Gordy, thank you.
|CAPCOM|Sounds like you're planning to stay there .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 21:23 CST 192:29 GET 776/2
192:29:00|CHALLENGER|(laughter) I speak for the Challenger.
|CAPCOM|Say, one final thing. In - some time in the next 30 minutes Parker will be coming on to take over here and just for your information today is his birthday. 
|CHALLENGER|Okay, thank you much.
|PAO|Parker is Astronaut Robert Parker, who is the spacecraft communicator, as Capcom, will be coming on to relieve Astronaut Gordon Fullerton on the shifts change in about 15 or 20 minutes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/14/72 GET 192:39 CST 21:31 MC777/1
192:39:00|PAO|After that last transmission, Gene Cernan indicated that he and Jack Schmitt were ready to return to the Command Module, close the hatch and leave Challenger to be jettisoned and later deorbited into the lunar surface. And again to go over the information for the Lunar Module deorbit, the time of ignition, which will start the LM on its trajectory toward the lunar surface is 195 hours 38 minutes 13 seconds. The deorbit burn will be a 158 second burn, using the reaction control system thruster, providing a change in velocity of 286 feet per second, primarily slowing the LM down, and getting it in orbit that intersects the lunar surface. LM impact is scheduled to occur, will be targeted to occur at 195 hours 57 minutes 12 seconds and the target at impact point will be 19*95 degrees north, 30.57 degrees east, which is about 9 kilometers from the ALSEP in South Massif, and hopefully will be visible to the television camera on the lunar surface.
|CHALLENGER|You want a hose. Yes.
|CHALLENGER|What, the suit hose?

We'll be reacquiring in about 45 minutes on the 54th revolution of the Moon. And, on that revolution, the lunar module, Challenger, will be separated and jettisoned from the CSM, preparatory to it being de—orbited and impacted into the lunar surface. We re having a shift handover here in Mission Control. Flight Director, Pete Frank and his team of flight controllers coming on to relieve the team headed by Flight Director Gene Kranz. And, we're planning a change-of-shift press briefing for 10 P.M. in the MSC News Center Briefing Room. At 192 hours 50 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

Still docked to the lunar module Challenger. Challenger will be jettisoned during this front side pass. We'll stand by now for first call to the crew.
|SC|Did I tell you direct 02 is OFF? The other day mine went up to 45. Well, it just goes that high. Don't make any difference what you do. I am too. So am I right now. No right yet, we got to wait till the 02 flow stops. Yeah, it'll increase out to, should be 41 to 4.5. Well, she's still going up. I'm reading 4.2 on the cuff gage. 41. And we're going up to about (garbled). Well, there's the total suits. Yeah, it's got 85 - 89. And it's stabled off about 43, 44 on mine now. Houston, America, how do you read?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, America.
|SC|Okay, we're in the(garbled) old suit circuit integrity check at the present time.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're copying you live.
|SC|Okay, direct 02 Is coming down now. Okay, 02 flow's coming down. And Houston, the tunnel's closed out and we're still in tunnel vent, and the hatch integrity is go .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SC|And 02 flow's down to .5 now. Yeah, that's right. The suit integrity check will pump you up that high. It's a - regulates through the Delta over cabin. Yeah. Maybe she might make it down to .4. It's going down. Well, maybe she's got her sensors stored up tight. What do you mean, there's so much dust in the joint they couldn't be anything else but tight. (Laughter). They're tighter than they were when we started. Oh yeah? But that lubing is just so it collects dust to make them tight. Uh huh.
|SC|It was down to .4 now it's up to about .5. .4 1/2. All we need is less than .8.
|SC|Well, I hadn't been timing it. I guess it's about 30 seconds though.
|SC|Oh, yeah. All set.
|SC|Yeah, I'm happy. Let's go to depress.
|SC|Me too.
|SC|Don't go to OFF, Gene,

|SC|Are you going to let the suit down or what?
|SC|It's going down - it's going down slow though.
|SC|Yeah, it is. We'll take it down real fast it you want to, but that's kind of hard on my ears. Okay, SECS power armed, circuit breaker, I wonder if I can reach those.

|SC|Okay, suit circuits integrity checked. We have already done that.
|SC|Okay, I'm loading the EMS to plus 100 and making a no bias check right now.

|SC|Okay, right down here now. I can't see that very well. Do you want to read the checklist?
|SC|Okay, uncase the B mags. Right to low. Then bend in, okay, wait a minute. We will do that. Already at 45, let's see. Okay. Might as well, I guess. Okay. The SCS. Man, I don't use that anyhow really. I just -I really don't use that anyhow really, (garbled). Did you ask if full power is on?
|SC|True.

|AMERICA|Yep.
|CAPCOM|Okay, then over at 195:31 -
|AMERICA|That just means you want the VHF OFF, doesn't it?
|CAPCOM|Right. All of these, I think - three switches over there along the side. And beacon ranging and —
|AMERICA|I think I understand that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I thought even an LMP would under stand that. At 195:31 we're going to move lunar sounder operate to OPERATE. The new start time there will be 195:3138. Over.
|AMERICA|Okay. Lunar sounder operate will be done, new time will be 195:3138.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and at the next page at 196:20 which was the original lunar sounder stop time, we will move all that block which starts with lunar sounder operate standby and achieve stop - that will all move over and goes down to UV ON. That block will move over to the 196:30 time of the next column and the T stop time there will be 196:30.

|CERNAN|Okay, Bob, and that's grey now. And HF antenna 2, mark it.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, we're observing C & C and 3 instead of going through the P 20. We wonder if you accidentially could have switched.

A - we're getting Ron out of his suit so that he can operate more effectively and efficiently the SIMBAY. And, then Jack and I are going to start getting out of our suits and trying to clean up a little bit and that's going to probably be a long and a tedious operation but we're just going to have to take that time.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. And, Ron, HF2 is the one that we're not quite sure of and you might take a visual on that — I think you've looked at it before when it's fully extended and and give us a clue whether it's 99 percent extended or not. Go ahead, Gene, I think I cut you off.
|SC|Stand by one - Wait until sunrise Bob, and he can look at it.
|SC|Bob, you're probably going to have to wait until sunrise to get a good verification of that.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Copy that. I just looked down the flight plan and saw you going into darkness.
|SC|It's easier with us.

|CAPCOM|That's affirmed. They're worried about HF 2 not being being all the way out and they think that they won't get much - if it's partially extended so we'll see what we can get with VHF instead. And right now we're going to standby to warm up the film to set it to go.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|I don't think I ever told you down there that mag keyhole keyhole was on frame 99 at the end of the rendezvous. At the end of the picture taking sessions there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and America, we'd like to bring up the high gains - what they use in the VHF and we'd like pitch of plus 25 yaw of 200 NARROW and REACQ.
|SC|Pitch of plus 25 yaw 200 REACQ and NARROW.
|SC|Pitch of plus 25. - Okay. - Okay,
|PAO|15 seconds to ignition.
|SC|Okay. Mod sensor.
|PAO|The LM is burning now.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we'd like H2 tanks 2 and 3 fans to on.
|SC|Okay. - 2 - H2 tank 2 is on, tank 3 is on.
|PAO|The burn has been completed.

|EVANS|Roger, 5 minutes to Challenger impact, h uh .
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. I don't know if you guys can see It out 1 window or not -
|SCHMITT|We're doing all right.
|EVANS|Let's see, we should be what - behind it, aren't we?
|CAPCOM|Say again, Ron.
|EVANS|Shouldn't we be behind him.
|CAPCOM|I should think he'd be a little bit behind you, right? Ron, I'll take that back, I think he is in front of you.
|EVANS|That's kind of the way I thought it would be. But unfortunately, we're looking behind us.
|CAPCOM|And 3 minutes to impact.
|EVANS|Okay, 3 minutes to impact.
|CAPCOM|Mark, 1 minute to impact.
|EVANS|Okay, 1 minute. Yeah, we're right over (garble) now.
|CAPCOM|10 seconds.
|CAPCOM|We've had LOS on the LM. Okay, we've had LOS on the LM and we'don't believe we saw it down here, fellows.
|EVANS|What do you mean you don't believe you s aw 11.
|CAPCOM|That means that we'didn't see it - on the TV.
|EVANS|Oh, on the TV, I see, I see.
|CAPCOM|We are picking up the signal on the siesmograph, though, the geophones.
|EVANS|Okay. Hey, Houston, I can see a bright spot on the South Massif, on the top of the South Massif.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead again there, guys.
|EVANS|Okay, this is America, I can see a bright spot on the top of the South Massif and - let me see -from the west you got the first hill or the first part of the mountains, then there's the valley and then there's a valley that kind of goes into a Y - a Y looking valley. I guess if you come from the east it's the second ridge from the east and right on top of that ridge is a bright spot. I don't know how big, I don't know how big a crater it should make.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that and we'll take a look at the maps and see what we can find.
|EVANS|And I'll put a spot on my map if I can do it here. Just a second.
|CAPCOM|And, Ron, this is Houston, you ready to copy an update in the flight plan, please for me.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 00:36 GET 195:43 MC 789/2
195:43:00|EVANS|Okay, do you need it right now or could I mark this on the map first.
|CAPCOM|No, oh no, go ahead and mark the map first .
|PAO|The seismic recorder data on the monitor is coming from the Apollo 17 Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment. The preleminary estimate is that the LM impact was within 15 kilometers of the Apollo 17 ALSEP site. And the TV camera will be coming off shortly.

196:08:00|AMERICA|Hey, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, America, this is Houston.
|AMERICA|Okay, Bob, I don't have a map with South Massif on it, you know with the radial interval on the thing and it looks like the only thing I can use in the visual observations book would be landing site 204, and if you draw a line - do you have that one?
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'm alining site 204 in f ront of me.
|AMERICA|Okay, if you draw a line from Shorty to that resolve mark that's on the top of the massif -
|CAPCOM|Copy that.
|AMERICA|And then extend about a little better than an eigth of an inch toward Shorty to that resolve mark. Have you - yeah, somewhere right in there. I'll look at it again the next time I come over. But, that's a bright spot on the top of the massif that I hadn't noticed before in any of the observations going by there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I've got it marked down. We'll also see if we can find it on the bigger map.
|AMERICA|Okay. You know that bright spot might already be there, but I don't think so, I don't remember seeing it,
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Okay, and Ron, we'd like to press on with our flight plan update for you.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Number one, we'd like to go HF2 to extend for 3 minutes.
|AMERICA|When? Now?
|CAPCOM|Roger, now.
|AMERICA|Okay, 5, 4 - okay, countdown - 3, 2, 1, mark it in extend. Barber pole still.
|CAPCOM|Ron, drop the antenna, please. My mistake.
|AMERICA|What?
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, let me read through this one for you. They are anxious to extend that but they want the data system on so they can see it first. Why don't you go to 9620 in the flight plan. You're probably sitting there looking at it, anyway. And run through that block, the spare starts at about 196:19. We told Jack to move but since we're aborting the lunar sounder path, let's go to 196:20 and carry out the steps in there with the following exceptions: Do not turn recorder or radar to OFF. Okay. We want lunar sounder left in standby.
|AMERICA|Okay. Let me read those through.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and don't move the high gain. The high gain has been taken care of already.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'll do that. Lun ar sounder is verified. Stand by. Data system coming on. High gain is already working. (garble). Jack, could you turn on the service module AC? I'll get it. Yeah. Okay, service module AC power's off. Lunar going to standby.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Ron -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12715/72 GET 196:98 CST 0100 MC 790/2
196:98:00|AMERICA|and we'll leave the recorder on and radar off.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, while you're putting those last three on, let's start the HF2 to extend. They'd like to get it before it gets too cold again.
|AMERICA|Okay, HF2 is going to extend - 4, 3, 2, mark it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll time it for 3 minutes for you while you get the IR and so forth.
|AMERICA|Okay, IR is going on. Self test is on heaters. EV Is on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that. Okay, Ron, we see the clock backwards and got off.
|AMERICA|Hey, it did. Okay, it's off.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I guess we'll try and work that in some other time now that we've got the antennas out. And we'd like to high gain antenna to auto and 2-1/2 degree deadband now that were not doing the lunar sounder.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, and did you get the high gain in the 2-1/2 degree deadband?
|AMERICA|Affirmative. Yeah, I got that.
|CAPCOM|Okay. You got that and I got a TI of 65 pad when you get ready for it.
|AMERICA|Okay, let me pull out the old book.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Ron, if you'll give us the com puter, we're ready to uplink some loads, for you. You'll be the jet out monitor and the (garbled) sensor.
|AMERICA|You can have the computer.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm ready to copy the TEI. Got it all dirty. Houston, America, I'm ready to copy the TEI pad.
|CAPCOM|Okay America, it's Houston. I'm ready to read the TEI pad if you're ready. It's an SPSGN which is a surprise, I'm sure, and it says, 36541 plus 060 plus 081. 216454823 plus 27545 minus 01469 minus 00090. 179103359. The rest of the pad is NA. GDCR in stars are Sirius and Rigel. I guess they picked some bright ones for you for a change. We have alinements of 136 -
|AMERICA|There, that's a good one -

196:22:00|SC|Sirius and Rigel, 136 160 034 dead 12 seconds for ullage and we used liftoff rest mat, which is what we have right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, and you dropped out there at 2 momentary seconds. 1, the DELTA VZ was minus a 9.0 — ullage was 4 jets.
|SC|Okay, that's right. DELTA VZ is minus 9.0 and 4 jet ullage 12 seconds. Lift off REFSMMAT.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you had a momentary dropout when you redd those two figures.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And, America, Houston. Do you fellows think you have any chance, or would have any chance next time to take a picture of that possible impact point - with the hand held Hasselblad - or something?
|SC|Ah - sure can. You betcha. I think the best way to do it is with the 250 lens on the Hasselblad.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It might be something worth getting just in case we'don't hit it with the pan camera later on.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ronald. The computer is yours and you can turn the lunar sounder radar switch off - leave the recorder switch on.
|SC|Okay. The recorder's staying on and we'll turn the - radar off.
|CAPCOM|Roger, radar off - recorder on and the computer is yours.
|SC|Okay, radar's going off and the recorder is still on. And - we LOS.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 196 hours 25 min utes. The tracking stations at Carnarvon, Honeysuckle, Hawaii and Goldstone recorded the Greenwich Mean Time at LM Loss of Signal as 6 hours 50 minutes 20 seconds.
|SC|Yes, (garbled) do it later on.
|SC|How about getting the recorder going there?
|SC|What?
|SC|How about turning the recorder on? - Huh? It's right in here.
|SC|Yeah. It's time to eat.
|SC|I don't care. Okay, waste to purge line heat e rs.
|SC|You're on. Then vent.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Ron, over.
|SC|Roger, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, one, while I'm talking to you how about flipping up and turning H2 tank 3 fan off?
|SC|Okay, tank 3 is off.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 01:1SCST 196:22GET MC791/2
196:22:00|CAPCOM|Okay, and then, how about you 3 guys giving us - giving some consideration the next 2 or 3 minutes to the following proposal? One, we totally avoided that lunar sounder pass because: 1, we couldn't get the HF antenna out and 2, because the temperature in the dome cassette was too low. Those things are both taken care of now and they're talking down here about essentially starting over at 197 hours which will be the top of the next page and pretending that that's 195 hours and running through that 195 hour page, beginning at 197 hours. The only problem with that, of course, is it runs into your eat period and destroys that, which essentially means that you're going to get to bed an hour later and, I guess what we're saying is if you're going to get to bed an hour later anyway we might go ahead and ask you to do it if you're agreeable. If you're clean—up - cleaning up companions there and have progressed far enough that you think you're going to get to bed on time and don't want to do it then that's another story. So, how about chewing it over there and letting us know.
|SC|Okay, let me talk to the guys here for a minute, but I think we'll probably do it. Stand by.
|SC|Hey, Houston, America. Let's press on and pretend like I'm eating between when I'm turning the lunar sounder on and off - Okay? In other words, let's get the lunar sounder pass.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well you're saying, well - well, we don't want you to have to do that in the middle of your eat period and destroy that, Ron. That's another concern we h ad h ere .
|SC|Don't worry about that. I - I can throw those switches on and the other guys can fix the food and I can eat it at the same time. No problem.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got that recorded on tape there, Ron. Okay, what we're going to do is essentially -
|SC|Okay, (laughter)
|CAPCOM|- essentially start at the 195 hour page and we'll just mechanically add 2 hours to every thing on that page and run through it as - on the page. Okay? The change that we originally had in the flight plan which I read, I don't know whether it was to you or to - a - Jack, which moved the group from 196 20 over to 196 30 - will still move over to 196 30, so that will stay as is. And, again, that will be of course at 198 30 then. Do you understand what I'm saying there? Over.
|SC|Yeah, I think what you're saying is, we'll just do the flight plan like you - like we're starting at 195.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Looks like we'll be 2 hours later on the Mason Timer.
|CAPCOM|Roger, you might call it mini-mock update.
|SC|Okay. Sounds good. Lunar sounder operating time will be 197 31 38 then, right?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 01:15 CST 196:22 GET MC791/3
196:22:00|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, and 2 comments on that. Let me make a couple of other amendments to that. One, the lunar sounder operating time instead of being 31 38 will be 32 51. At that 195 -top of the right hand column on 195 there. 195 32 51 . Over.
|SC|And Houston, these waste water dumps fuel cell purges, that doesn't foul up sounder as I recall, does it ?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 196:39 CST 1:32 MC 792/1
196:39:00|SC|And, Houston, these waste water dump fuel cell pressures that doesn't foul up the lunar sand as I recall, I don't think - does it?
|CAPCOM|Oh, we can go ahead and do those in parallel, right.
|SC|Okay, good. That's what I thought.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, one other - did you catch my one - my 3251 update there on that start time?
|SC|Did you say cancel it? I'm sorry.
|CAPCOM|No, do copy. I gave you 1953251 as the start time, instead of 3138, did you copy that?
|SC|Yeah, I copied, I'm sorry. Used to working in the box all time and I forget to push the button.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and the other thing we'd like to keep you aware of, if you hadn't noticed it, and that is that this thing of course, Ron's originally to a 19630 plus which means that you're going to be running 19830 plus which kind of looks like you're going to be eating at least a half an hour into your sleep period, at the very least. Over.
|SC|Yeah, we understand that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we'd like to have H2 tank 2 fan OFF now please.
|SC|H2 tank 2 is going OFF.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 196 hours 46 minutes. We've had loss of signal from America. We'll acquire next in about 45 minutes, on the 56th revolution. In about 13 minutes another lunar sounder pass will begin to compensate for the one that was lost at 195 hours. Because of an antenna problem and low film cassette temperatures. Those problems have been corrected and the crew will do a new pass beginning at 197 hours. This will probably put them to bed about 30 minutes later than the flight plan time. Rest period will probably begin now. About 199 hours.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 02:23CST 197:29GET MC793/1
197:29:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 197 hours 29 minutes. We are less than a minute away from acquisition of America on the 56th revolution. We'll standby for this pass.
|CAPCOM|Hello, America. This is Houston. One minute to lunar sounder operate - mark.
|SC|Okay, one minute to lunar sounder operate MARK. This is your friendly commander, clean and happier, back up.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Geno. We're glad to hear you're clean again.
|SC|Well, I'm not really clean but it's a major step in the right direction.
|SC|30 seconds.
|SC|Okay , 30 seconds .
|CAPCOM|Okay, and mark on lunar sounder operato n ow.
|SC|Okay, Bob.
|CAPCOM|And, America, a question here. Did you get an ISS alarm on the backside just a few minutes ago?
|SC|No, sir.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We lucked out. We'd - since we'd had the jet monitor program operating and it hadn't been killed, which had originally been planned after lunar sounder, there was a possibility that we'd get an OR but we'don't have it. Good enough.
|SC|What was going to cause that to come on?
|CAPCOM|The possibility, Ron, was when you were reloading NOUN 79, getting a smaller dead band - it depends upon where the vehicle was at that time within the old dead band. EMP 523 might have suddenly found you outside the dead band and been unhappy.
|SC|Ah, okay. I'm with you. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, looks like we lucked out some.
|SC|Say, Bob, do you know - do you know any more about the demise of Challenger?
|CAPCOM|We know that it was within 15 kilometers of where it was supposed to be, Gene. We could not get a visual on it. It was quite obvious that the geophone saw it and all that - there's no question about that, it's just that as it turned out at the last minute it was pretty hard to pick where exactly it was going to be In order to have the TV camera there.
|SC|But everything appeared to function properly on the ALSEP and - you're pretty happy with it?
|CAPCOM|Roger. Everything except the TV and of course that's just an extra goodie.
|CAPCOM|And, America, if you guys are interested in trying to take a couple of 250 millimeter shots of that time, we've got a little camera pad here 4B can pass up -if you're interested.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 02:23CST 197:29GET MC793/2
197:29:00|SC|Hey, you bet I'll take - I'll try it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, let me know when you get a piece of paper there, Ron.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's LM TCA and it's time is 197 56 35 and the camera data is CM 5 EL 250 CEX F5.6 1/125 infinity and magazine Kappa Kappa or Kilo Kilo and you can use up to 10 frames on it. Over.
|SC|Okay. I think I'll put Kappa Kappa back, I've got Oscar Oscar on there. How about it if I use that, Okay?
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's fine, Ron. And, we'd like to get H2 tanks 2 and 3 fans back on.
|SC|2 and 3 are on.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Hey, Bob. A quick summary on that ren dezvous as far as LM performance was concerned. Handling characteristics were outstanding and pretty much the same as they have always been on LM command. The APS burn went nominal the residuals on that one were actually quite big, about 744, that's feet per second - and we nulled those out and after that the midcourses were back to 1.3 and then a max of 1.6 on the second one. But, after the TPI we were coming up the pike right - over - right - all the way in the line-of-sight range -actually both out of plane as well as in plane were - zero -practically zero for out of plane and as predicted on a nominal curve for in-plane. And really, it was pretty much a story book rendezvous .
|CAPCOM|Okay. Ron, do you want to give me that TPI again or did you already pass that down to ground command didn't copy the residuals then?
|SC|No, I didn't tell them that. we'didn't get a chance to copy them down cause I wanted to get this all down on tape. It surprised me after the APS burn because they were relatively large. They were 7 feet per second in X 4 in Y and 4 in Z. And that was, I guess, just short of a 4 second burn or around 4 seconds.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SC|And one other little thing we put I think 2 marks - 3 marks - 2 or 3 marks in the AGS - manual marks, after the last midcourse, as we'd been doing in the Simulator. 3 marks, and Jack tells me that the range rate came right up to -right up to the actual radar range rate - right up to 100 feet or so.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 02:34 GET 197:42 MC-794/1
197:42:00|SC|Bob, we're all just eating away here, anything interesting in the World news that* s worth commenting on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by, let me find out. Did you guys get any news this morning?
|SC|No sir, we were busy otherwise.
|SC|Yeah, I did.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well stand by and let me get hold of the people and see if we can get some news for you. Okay, Gene, we're working on that, it may take us a while to get it and but we ought to have it for you before the end of the pass. From my own experience talking around you although none of us hung around much to read that stuff today, we'don't think anything much did happen in the world today. There is a report that something did happen in outer-space. The Moon vehicle, we believe, had a lift off this afternoon and a rendezvous, we're trying to see if we can track down any further news of that. Over.
|SC|Okay, we're pretty much up on that one. Just wondering, you know Mr. Truman has been pretty sick and so forth, wondered about some of those things, but no big deal, we can wait.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll get with you shortly. Hey, in the America, did you fellows do your hydrogen purge on the back side.
|SC|That's affirm. Had us a purge, an 02 purge, and - would you believe we forgot to turn the H2 purge line heater off, off now.
|SC|Thank you.
|SC|First saw the leak on there.
|CAPCOM|Old Decon was watching the currents there. He had you pinned down.
|SC|(laughter) Good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and America, I presume you guys are sitting there looking at page 195, is that affirm, so I want bother to tell you all you all these other things that are going on on that page, presuming that you're not looking at page 197.
|SC|Yeah, we're on page 195, yeah.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good enough.
|SC|Really is the hour 195, you know.
|CAPCOM|OMNI Bravo, please, America.
|SC|Okay, You have it. Houston, this is America, there was frame 145 to 150 on magazine Oscar Oscar.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy 145 to 150 on Oscar Oscar, and if you guys are starting to sort out film mags for the next day, which is for what, about 198 hours, it will be magazine Kilo Kilo instead of November November in that. It will be Kilo, Kebet and Romeo for tomorrow.

198:00:00|SC|Houston, 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|A little historical note. Passing over the Hadley Apennines sites from Apollo 15, we notice that at their landing point, there's the same slightly or - destinctly brighter albedo area as there is at Taurus Littrow site.
|CAPCOM|You mean down on the plains of Taurus- Littrow right where the LM landed? Or you mean where you think the LM impact was?
|SC|That* s affirmed that in spite of the - no, no, no, where the LM landed - in spite of the - as we walked along the surface, and this is true at Hadley also, you stirred up a darker zone, albedo-wise, but when you look at it from orbit, the area around where the LM landed is a distinct bright spot on the surface of a very uniform gray albedo plain. And both sites look just alike.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that.
|SC|In that regard, anyway.
|CAPCOM|We copy that.
|PAO|That report was from Jack Schmitt.
|CAPCOM|And America, you might be interested to know that the way this Span status report still lists all the LM ECS parameters as normal.
|SC|Beautiful, Span's up to their old tricks again, I see.
|CAPCOM|I guess you depend on how you define normal.

|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy. You're down as far UV ON. Now we'd like to have IR cover OPEN, and UV cover OPEN also.
|SC|Okay. Stand by. Did you want 2 and 1/2 degree deadband for the night?
|CAPCOM|Rog. I was just going to say we can also go to VERB 22 for the 2 1/2 degree deadband. Okay, and America, another thing down here 19647 there are the 2 COMM call outs DSE in motion and setting the high gain to manual before LOS, and we want to catch those before you go around the back side. And just - yeah, as you around at LOS and after that we're then ready for you guys to skip to 198 and the pre-sleep - pre-sleep checklist.
|SC|Okay, we can do that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and America, if you have time I have a few news items to read up to you here.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Dateline Washington, the United States today threw it's support behind the Christmas peace package proposed by South Vietnamese President, Nguyen Van Thieu and accused North Viet Nam of using high pressure tatics in attempt to impose an incomplete peace settlement. American representative of the Paris peace talks, told the Communists it was futile for them to continue clamoring for signature of the cease-fire agreement drafted in October by Kissinger and Le Due Tho. In Kansas City the condition of former President Harry S. Truman weakened to quote very serious Thursday. His doctor says vital signs are stable but Former President Truman was unable to speak his lungs were filling with fluids still, and his kidneys have been impared. In Mexico City the international federation of airline pilots, meeting in Mexico City this week, has promised a world-wide stoppage of all transportation industries if the government does not take action to stop hyjackings. In New York, the United States won an apparent victory in the United Nations when the General Assembly voted an approval of a cut in U.S. contributions to the world organization. Vote was 81 to 27. And reduces the U.S. budget assessment from 31.5 percent to 25 percent starting 1974. Here at home in Houston, the city council voted to locate the new proposed sports arena in Greenway Plaza. The (garbled) however stipulates that the mayor find a way to finance it without using city tax funds. Council indicated that if the mayor can't do this, the city will abandon it's plans for the 10 million dollar 18 thousand seat facility. On the lighter side, in Jersey City, only 1 of 51 women who took physical exams for the police department passed. Police director Fredrick Stevens said 24 of the women were too short, 7 were underweight, and 4 did not have eyesight that could be corrected.

198:29:00|CAPCOM|In sports, the Alberta Oilers, that's Alberta and not Houston Oilers, these are the hockey ones, skated passed the Houston Arrows for a 3 to 2 victory here in Houston. And the Minnesota Vikitigs in the City of Minneapolis, came to terms on the lease agreement to play their games in a proposed stadium up there in the north. Oh I guess it's building a stadium to keep it from being too cold, instead of being too muggy like it is down here. And that's the news as you can see it's a slow news day and things are still moving very slowly down here.
|SC|Thank you, Bob.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 198:36 CST 0329 MC 798/1
198:36:00|SC|Bob, we realize it's tomorrow down there but this still might be appropriate. (All together) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Bob, happy birthday to you.
|CAPCOM|Well, all I can say, it might be appro priate but it's not very musical.
|SC|(Laughter)
|CAPCOM|Thank you, guys.
|SC|Happy, Bob, happy. At least you know it's from the bottom of our - hearts.
|CAPCOM|And just to let you guys know that I'm not easily swayed and made soft by such shows of sentiment, I want to remind the CDR on the LMP that they're going to start collecting their urine from now on, and you shouldn't have been dumping it since 197:00.
|SC|Okay, we're in the process of changing over.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and cover the rope on the UV and the IR so we won't be dumping it anyway right now, tonight, right?
|SC|That's right.
|CAPCOM|And Jack, you're going to be on the biomed t on i ght ?
|SC|Whose side are you on? Of course I am. Bob, I'm hooking up right now. I sort of rested my own personal sensors and I'm putting the mechanical ones on - electrical ones, I guess.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I tell you what. If you wait 6 minutes until after LOS to finish that, you'll leave the surgeon in suspense until you come around on air (garble). That'll help keep him awake.
|SC|Okay, I'll see what I can do one way or the other. It's not according to flight plan. Hey, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Would you say what you said a little while ago about the waste - not waste dumps, but urine dumps?
|CAPCOM|Okay, as per the checklist, it says at 19 - 197 hours, CDR and LMP collect urine in UTSs until 208 hours, so until tomorrow morning. And I was just reminding you that you don't want to be hosing it overboard right now because the UB and IR covers are open and we presume since you have already done the waste water in the H2 purge on the backside, that sufficient time has passed to open them. My guess is that we sort of presumed that you weren't in the mode of dumping urine overboard.
|SC|Okay, that's fine. I was thinking of the BUSS collection then - that's fine.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and America, once you fellows finish your presleep checklist, you're to go for sleep. You're GO for LOS and we won't be saying anything to you when you come around the front side next time around, in case you've nodded off. Call us if you want to and we'll just let it be as if we're finished with you for the night.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 198:36 CST 0329 MC 798/2
198:36:00|SC|Okay, thank you, Robert. We're hastening to finish the checklist and get some sleep, and unless we have some problems or questions, we won't be talking to you until tomorrow.
|CAPCOM|Okay, talk to you tomorrow night.
|SC|Hey, Bob, on the biomed LMP, if it doesn't show up to my normal standardsj it's because maybe the sensors have come off. I'm - I've put a little of the bacterial salve on them and they probably won't stick too well, but I'll do the best I can.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Preventive medicine, Bob, not curative.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that'll make the surgeon happy.
|SC|And, before we fade out of sight, you might look at the biomed. Whoops, I've got one left.
|CAPCOM|We're in low pit rate, we can't see you right now.

|PAO|Wake-up music today was Roberta Flack's rendi— tion of The Last Time Ever I Saw Your Face.
|SC|Who selected that song, Joe Allen?
|CAPCOM|No, that's Neil's special. You've got Neil Hutchinson to blame on that one. I must say he had a lot of accomplices on that.
|SC|Yeah, Bob, I think maybe that's one of the best songs that's come out in the last ten years, if you ask me.
|CAPCOM|Roger.

|CAPCOM|Okay, the only thing we want to tell you is don't do the solar corona, and we've already told you that. We'll get back with you later on that. If you want I'll read you the morning news.
|SC|Hey, okay. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, there's been a temporary halt to the peace talks in Paris, and as we mentioned before, Henry Kissinger is in Washington and has conferred with President Nixon. A ceasefire proposal suggested by South Vietnemese government officials has been rejected by the U.S. White House News Secretary Ron Zeigler has declined to characterize the present Paris peace efforts, but did say there are still some obstacles to overcome. And we had another hijack attempt, a youthful Canadian, who hijacked an airliner in northern Canada was talked out of his escapade by his father. The youth had held 62 persons aboard the plane for a short while, then retained only 4 hostages for 10 hours. It appears that the United Mine Workers may have a new president. Maverick candidate Arnold Miller retained a strong lead over Tony Boyle in the government supervised election. The transatlantic airfare price war that seems imminent, promises to be a real boon to the vacationer. It is now estimated that airfare may be as low as $136.00 for the transatlantic fare in some special categories. Juan Peron has ended his month long visit to Argentina. An attempt was made to nominate him for the presidential election while he was there, but the move was declared illegal and he returned to Paraguay. A few other news highlights -the village of Rhonda, Switzerland is threatened by a half million ton portion of a glacier moving down a mountain. Willie Brandt has been sworn in as Chancellor of West Germany for his second term. Former President Truman remains seriously ill.

Comedian Bob Hope is set again for his annual tour1 of U.S. overseas military bases. His first Christmas show in the Far East is December 21. Now in the local news here, there's a good chance that Texans may soon legally put a bet down on a horse race. A state senate's studying - study committee has heard some1. : heavy opposition to paramutual betting in Austin, but the proposal1; appears to have a good chance of approval. And if you follow the Tomball police force, who quit en masse a couple of days1, ago - Tomball has rehired three of the officers who quit, and two more of the police who walked out are seeking to be rehired. And just a note here - there was a little beautification of Houston. Some of the thousands of billboards that line main highways around Houston will be coming down after the first of the year. All signs must be licensed by the state and a fee paid after that time. Some of the sports news: Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds catcher who had a benign spot removed from a lung Monday, is recovering nicely at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. The star baseball player will remain hospitalized for about five more days. Brad Van Pelt of the Michigan State University defensive star won the Maxwell Club trophy as the year's top college football player. The Washington Redskin's Larry Brown took top honors as the top professional player of the year. Southern Methodist has apparently chosen a new football coach to succeed Hayden Fry, but University officials say an announcement won't come until week. Mark Spitz and Shane Gould, both top Olympic swimmers, were honored as top athletes in the world by European sports writers. With this batch here, of course. There was no action last night in college basketball. The University of Houston is getting ready to play California tomorrow night. Joe Paterno, Penn State coach, has won the Walter Camp Football Foundation award as coach of the year. And it appears that Mike Tillamen of the Oilers may play out as option this year and this - Coach Bill Peterson says that it upsets his draft plans this coming year. And I've already updated the weather to you. I just might add a little parenthetical thought that it's really not that much in the news and all the news around here anyway has been Apollo 17 and your liftoff. We picked up the liftoff last night from the Moon and carried it live TV for about 2-1/2 minutes as you went out of sight like a star, and then of course, live TV picked up your docking and rendezvous and docking. A very spectacular picture, I might add, of the lunar surface as the Challenger came up to meet America. Ove r.

Before things go too far, i'll be around watching for the rest of the flight, of course, but before things got too far I wanted to pass my comments on to you guys that, boy, it's really been super. You guys have — between the performance of you guys and the performance of the hardware, it's been a piece of cake down here. I hope it's staying that same way up there, and we're really looking forward to finishing this thing up and getting you back home, and my hat's off to you.
|AMERICA|Okay, Jerry, I appreciate those words, but any performance of ours, and certainly that of the hardware, has to go all to the performance of you guys down there, because you know, you are the guys that make it happen and we'do appreciate it. And I guess this is sort of a semi-retirement for you then, is that right?
|CAPCOM|Well, I don't know whether to call it semi retirement. It's a relaxed feeling, I'll tell you that. But I'm anxious to do it again, and hoping to get a chance to do something more like this.
|AMERICA|You betcha we're all going to keep doing it, and listen you couldn't have left it in a more able set of hands than Neil's down there. We'll have to celebrate your 3 day or 4 day rest period when we get back.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Talk to you later.
|AMERICA|I didn't realize we wore you out.
|CAPCOM|I will throw one thing right quick, you know the activation descent bay, that was the third one I had handled, and including all the simulations and all the three of the actual flight, I think it's the first time we can say we really did it all right. For one reason or another, it really turned out to be a fairly easy day and I was really surprised.
|AMERICA|Jerry, that spacecraft that we were working with was undoubtedly the best vehicle along with America that I've ever flown.

Meal A had bacon squares, scrambled eggs, orange juice, and coffee, vitamin, Meal B, piece of lightning (laughter) Meal B is chicken and rice soup, meat balls with sauce, butterscotch pudding, orange drink, carmel candy, apricot cereal cubes, brownies. I guess that was it. Meal Charlie, potato soup, beef and gravy, ambrosia peaches there - about half of it - 4 brownies and an orange drink. Okay, on the medical log - PRD is 150 47 and I had about 6-1/2 hours of sleep in oh, cat naps I guess - some of them were a couple hours long. And had two sniffs of nose drops on each side prior to going to sleep and 5 cans of fluid. Okay, for the commander s menu - how do we get to day 10 - day nine yesterday -
|CAPCOM|Ron, excuse us - would you have somebody turn the pan camera to OFF, please.
|SC|Mark it. It's off.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we'd like the IR cover closed and the UV cover closed at this time.

|SC|Bob, in lieu of the solar corona photography, I watched - Gene and I both watched it set and there are two bands which I still can see now a zodical light I guess, going out symmetrically on either side of the plane in the ecliptic and they make an angle between themselves of about let's say 70 to 80 degrees. I can still - knowing they are there - I can still pick up the bands, the streamers, I guess would be a better word and last night when I watched one set there was a strong linear streaker going out -oh, maybe 3 or 4 or 5 diameters - I'll have to get my directions straight. Well, I'll figure out which side of the ecliptic it was - that was not nearly so strong when I looked this time -now partly that may be dark adaptation, I don't know, but I'll1; try to keep track of that one. But these two streamers today are about an equal strength and they are still visible as zodiacal light.

|SC|Okay, we're in reacq.
|SC|Going retract.
|SC|(garble) wait a minute.
|SC|Oh, okay.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Mapping camera is going OPEN. Mark. And it's grey. And you want to extend the mapping camera, huh?
|CAPCOM|AUTO and high gain, first of all.
|SC|Okay, that's what they said they wanted. Okay, going to AUTO again.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Houston, America. You say you're going to extend the mapping camera, now?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, we're extending it early cause we want to time it, and extend it now, please and give us a mark when you start it.
|SC|Okay, mark it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and might as well finish up the flight plan updates if you don't mind. The next one is at 20901.
|SC|Okay, go ahead, 20901.
|CAPCOM|You're going to delete the mapping camera laser altimeter cover open and mapping camera extend, at that position cause you've just done it. Just scratch them out.
|SC|Okay, Bob. I got that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and at 20903 - add after pan camera power - add V over H override high altitude.
|SC|Okay, I got that V over h high alt at 20903.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, and -
|SC|Hey, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|Okay, let me interrupt here a minute, Bob. Can we go ahead and dump with the mapping camera extended?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Ron.
|SC|Okay, mighty fine, thank you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll just show a full extend at 20940, Jack, in the flight plan where it says liftoff time update is not required. At 20940, we'll not do a liftoff time update.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 13:16 GET 208:23 813/2
208:23:00|SC|20940. You're not going to do a lift off time update, huh?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. And I've got a pan camera pad while you're on that page. The pan camera pad which is opposite 209 15- 209 15.
|SC|209 15 pan camera photo pad. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, T-start 2091444, T-stop 2092736, and that covers1all of it. We can settle back to the flight plan now11
|SC|Okay, we - I will do that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sir, and if you'll give us ACCEPT, we've got a state vector at this time for you.
|SC|Okay, you have it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and Ron, you may be interested, we had a nominal extend on the mapper.
|SC|Hey, great. I guess once the door stays out of the way, it'll come out alright, huh?
|CAPCOM|Right.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Just for - first of all - the computer is yours, you can go back to block. Just for your information, at the beginning of the next rev we re going to have a flight plan update. Or actually, we'll have a pan camera pad at the beginning of the rev and then into the rev after the orbital science visuals, we'll have a flight plan update. What we're going to be doing is - we're going to be doing an extra ultraviolet scan program and we're going to do some antenna calibration on the HF and lunar sounder antenna so we got quite a lengthy flight plan update and after that it'll just be flying the flight plan. The thing with the lunar sounder is that we're getting a1. lot of noise from earth that we'don't see on the back side of the Moon in the HF and we'd like to calibrate this out.
|SC|Okay, you want to give us those updates now or are you going to -
|CAPCOM|Negative, we'll wait until next rev, they're not that extensive - we just have a number of them. We want you to be aware that they'll be coming up. They will not interrupt your orbital science visual targets there at Mare Smythii or at the landing site visual.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 13:26 CST 208:33 GET MC814/1
208:33:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. You're about 2 minutes from LOS here. We've got 2 items - the America lsJooking great and as you go around the horn there's no problems open on it. If you do - we would like the LMP Jac t you'd push on your EKG sensor a little bit we isn't too good - the EKG sensors. And on your H2 tank configuration, Ron, we'd like you to take H2 tank 3 fans to OFF and H2 tank 2 fans to ON.
|SC|Okay. Tank 3 is OFF. Tank 2 is ON.
|CAPCOM|Roger1nhanoe
|SC|Okay, Bob. First break I have I 11 change - have to change those sensors. I - I needed to put that salve on and I didn't. That's probably the same problem on the way out1, T.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Don't change them Jack. The CMP is due to come on before too long so just press on them and see if we can improve the data a little bit ut on change them out. And you're looking great and we 11 pick you up again at 209:23.
|SC|Maybe that ratty data is me.
|CAPCOM|No, No, it's not that way.
|PAO|And we've had loss of signal as the space craft, America, passed behind the moon nearing the end of the 61st lunar orbit. Some 48 minutes until the spacecraft comes around again on revolution 62. During that frontside pass the crew was wakened very pleasantly by a recording uplink to them by Roberta Flack of The Last Time Ever I Saw Your Face. And after they had sufficiently wakened the flight plan updates for the days activity were read up to the crew by spacecraft communicator, Bob Overmeyer. 65 nautical miles by 62.5 pericynthion and at 208.40 this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 14:14CST 209:22GET 815/1
209:22:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 209 hours 22 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 17 Spacecraft America coasting around at this time on the start of lunar orbit number 62, 40 seconds away from acquisition by the ground station antennas. Still in a 62 by 65 nautical mile orbit. Waiting confirmation as the spacecraft comes around the corner. And we have, indeed, picked up the downlink voice and data signal at the tracking station. We have had acquisition. Let's stand by for the initial conversations.
|SC|Okay, we've got you OMNI D. Somehow we got off attitude here -
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, understand you're on OMNI D. You're coming up on 30 seconds away from pan camera D stop time. I have another pan camera pad I'd like to give you before we get into the GARBLE visual.
|SC|Okay. Geno, get the pad. 27 36 - 27 36 Jack.
|SC|Grab on the pan.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the pan camera photo pad is at 209 30 - 209 45 are you read for that one?
|SC|Standby - pan camera to standby. Okay, pan camera standby.
|CAPCOM|That should get it. Okay, the pan camera photo pad T start time 209 49 04, T stop time 209 51 01. Over.
|SC|Okay I've got T start of 209 49 04 and T stop 5101.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and we'll hold off on the other pads until after your visuals.
|SC|I don't have much to do anyway with Bob, what yo u s aid.
|CAPCOM|Rog, if you want we're readyto start GARBLE copy the visuals.
|SC|Okay, that's right. GARBLE. (static in background) Okay, we're coming across Mare Smythii, one of the -first thing I'm concentrating on is the - well, it's both of the GARBLE camera GARBLE high gain angle.
|CAPCOM|Roger, trying to get one.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Ron if you'll do a standard reacq for the high gain GARBLE.
|CAPCOM|Sounds great.
|SC|How do you read, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, Houston, how you?
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|We'd like reacq on the high gain until we call auto, please.
|SC|Reacq in narrow gain.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we're standing by.
|SC|Okay, Houston on the - the crater is to the north of the Wright Brothers. The slope of the walls is steep -probably 45 degrees on the inside - it's a gradual slope on the outside slipping away from the crater. There is no apparent albedo differences in the ejecta or pattern annulus around the crater itself and we're looking specifically at the one to the northwest of the Wright Brothers now. There is a definite mare flow that is unindated and it's a different color and you know that you have a light albedo to it now, it's kind of a grayish tan. It's a light grayish tan material that has flowed - and I can't tell - it almost looks like it's sloped down to the crater. There is an impact crater right at the breech of the crater which has nothing to do with the flow itself. The material in the -I'm almost outside of it already, I was going to say the material in the inner crater in these boulder ring structures down there — the material all the way in the center of it is comparable to the hummocky bumpy looking type stuff that is not really the mare -not the smooth mare of Smythii - but the other part of the mare is Smythii. And -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 14:24 CST 209:32 GET MC-816/1
209:32:00|CAPCOM|Are there any differences in the craters, Ron?
|AMERICA|Yeah, some of the craters are crystalline and you can't see the multi-ring structures on them. And some of them that are definitely impact craters, you know, that have the ejecta rings around them. I've got to study them a little bit more, it's really the first chance I've had to look at Smythii. Was there some comment about (garble) but I want to take a look at him a little bit more. Some of the multi-ring basins there - the walls are not delta shaped at all. The one to the north and let's see, as you look to the right (garble) there's one directly north and then the next one, and then the next one. One directly north we'll say is 12 o'clock; the other one is 1 o'clock; and then a 2 o'clock crater. The 1 o'clock crater looks to me there is a high lava mark around the outer basin, the outer ring of the crater itself. The one at 12 o'clock is the one I was talking about, has the breach on it with the later impact, the small impact crater on it. And without the binoculars I couldn't tell flow direction whether they were flowing into the multi-ring basin from that mare patch on the outside or vice versa, so I'm going to try to check that out next time around.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we're standing by for any comments along your ground track here and we're following you. We would like to — when you get up on the landing site, we'd like you to concentrate on Stoney and F crater. F crater where those textural differences we noticed the other day.
|AMERICA|Okay. Bernie, I think - right, I called the Stoney the other day too I think but -
|CAPCOM|Bernie, yeah, Shorty, I'm sorry.
|AMERICA|The one out on the land slide.
|CAPCOM|All right, we want you to mark the breach that you see on the photo, please. Or on the map.
|AMERICA|Okay, that's that's the breech on the - on Mare Smythii.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm, Ron. And Ron, if you'll ask Gene or Jack or somebody to get your pan camera to mono now, please.
|AMERICA|Okay, pan camera's going to mono.
|AMERICA|Okay, good. (Garble) as much as stick 'ui, I got the binoc's.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, we're still standing by for any calls you might want to make enroute to the landing site.
|AMERICA|Okay. Well again you can speak of text- or color - the differences on the thing. And the sun angle now looking west you get the same streaked — well, the verticle streaks that I talked about before that you see on the back side at the high sun angle - higher sun angles again. And that seems to show up more and more, I think, at the higher sun angle. And these are the -what I call radial - radial streaks down in the fresh craters that essentially start at the top of the crater rim and go down inside of them. If you take a look at these streaks, I don't - I don't
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 14:24 CST 209:32 GET MC-816/2
209:32:00|AMERICA|see bow they could be due strictly to the sun angle on them, I think, because they're all the way around the crater,
|CAPCOM|Roger, did you have a particular crater in mind along the -
|AMERICA|No, and they would -- Well, I'm trying to find the name of it right now. It doesn't make any difference which one it is. It's in all of the -- all the craters,1. . all the valleys, and everything, and it looks like the Sculptured Hills around the landing site.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We understand there.
|CAPCOM|Set one up at AP Polonius. That area now (garble).
|AMERICA|Yep.
|CAPCOM|Is there any significance -- any difference between the contact of Crisium to the Highlands or is the (garble) in that — the area where you're flying over Mare Tran — Fertility? And, the Highlands right there between the two contact points?
|AMERICA|No, the Highlands look essentially the same as you — as you pass from Crisium on across to Fertility, and, again, they look so much like the Sculptured Hills, it's ridiculous (garble). It's all the high sun — high sun angle again. You got the streaks and the highs and there — there are masses of Highlands, though, on the border of Crisium here, though that — although they look like the Sculptured Hills, the sculpturing seems to be radially upslope and then downslope from the center of Crisium and just in small local areas of the Highlands.
|CAPCOM|Roger, roger. Do you see any (garble) -
|AMERICA|In that way, I think they do differ from the Sculptured Hills.
|CAPCOM|-- Fra Mauro (garble)?1.
|AMERICA|No, Bob, the one I'm referring to is on the Highlands bordering Crisium, but in about all of them you do see a definite radial pattern upslope and downslope. From the center of Crisium, but none of the lineaments like you're talking about like at Fra Mauro.
|CAPCOM|Roger, copy.
|AMERICA|Kind of film — oh, I got the wrong film in the mag. (Garble) Let's see, there's Xerxes, and then, to the side of the slope, come Xerxes, then there's about a 50-kilometer crater, then there's a subdued crater, and right on the western rim of Crisium, the western edge of that subdued crater, it's almost a 70-degree slope down there, and it's a square straight slope on the thing. There doesn't seem to be any ejecta piled up in the bottom of it at all, but within the slope, and it must be 50 — about — yeah, 50 kilometers long, and there's a bright impact crater on the top of the hill, top of the rim, right below that bright crater, you have the tannish brown streak that goes through the whole slide.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 14:34 GET 209:42 817/1
209:42:00|SC|Go through the whole slide. The rest of the slope itself is the bright light - real light light tan, I call it. I'll find the name of that crater on the map in a minute. I think the circumference of that crater right there ceases to be round - it just is squared off with a linear brink about oh - at least 20 percent of the circumference of the entire crater.
|CAPCOM|Now are you talking about a crater on' the Mare or Crisium or are you talking about up near Barocius P in that
|SC|Yes, it's right - no it's right on the mare. A subdued crater right on the Mare of Crisium just below Yerkes.
|SC|Jack, where's the -
|SC|Oh, the film - (garble)
|SC|Window 3 is a good one. Glare is (garbled)
|SC|Ah, let's see, F8 at 250, right here.
|CAPCOM|Very shortly you should be coming up on the mare prior to the landing site across TranquiHit atis and then to the landing site.
|SC|Oh, yes, that's affirm, we just, I got Proclus at the window No. 3 now.
|SC|Yeah
|SC|Yeah, the landing site really shows up - even from this distance right now we're right over Proclus and looking off across off down through the hills there, you have a definite dark and now the albedo or the colored texture of the thing to me is turning more of a gray than a tan-gray. In the early parts of it I thought it was a dark grayish tan I guess or something like that. Now it looks to me like it s more tan - I mean more gray. I'm sorry, It has essentially the same -
|CAPCOM|On (garbled)
|SC|Ah, not yet.
|SC|Yeah, this is Gene. I've got it on and the streaked albedo changed differences very definitely. One is the dark mantle on the floor. One is the South and North Massif and the other is the Sculptured Hills. And the Sculptured Hills are at a light gray albedo between the Massiff and the dark mantle. It is not very evident and there's a definite break in slope that you can. The South Massif (garbled) slide , but the white mantle is out on the valley floor. And from here Shorty stands out like a sore thumb.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're interested in all three of you on that colored texture difference up at Shorty and then we'd like to have a comparison from Shorty to F Crater if it is possible.
|SC|Okay, that crater is a harder than a son of a buck to find. That crater is right on Family Mountain and there's one to the north of Family Mountain or a little i ways there's a darker crater and then there's also one to the south of it. I can't find one on Family Mountain at all. I couldn't the other day so I'm going to see if I can find it today.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 14:34 GET 209:42 817/2
209:42:00|SC|Bob, to me the Sculptured Hills incor porate the albedo, both of the North Massif, or the Massif and the mantle area and combine them to give you a generally in between gray albedo but the sculpturing is produced by the darker albedo that looks like the mantle, and the lighter albedo that looks like the massif.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And for Ron, the F crater is just to the south of Family Mountain. It's the one that you mentioned south of Family Mountain.
|SC|(garbled)
|SC|Ohhh, okay. That's the one I saw the other day. It looks about like Shorty.
|CAPCOM|Is there any -
|SC|From here Bob, they're both very dark
|CAPCOM|Is there color differences up -
|SC|Have to check that just a second.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we're about 30 seconds from the start time on the pan camera.
|SC|Can't see that far standby.
|SC|There is a definite bright spot up on the side of the hill with the - almost the extension of that slide area from Shorty.
|CAPCOM|Hey, you guys, we're about 10 seconds from the start time on the pan camera.
|SC|Yeah, Jack's getting the T start. Okay I still get a -
|CAPCOM|Mark T start time.
|SC|11' s an -
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|Okay, on Shorty I still have the light and orangish tan type of material that is essentially perpendicular to the line of the slide area there in the northern semi-circle. Another thing I see F crater - boy, I can't hold these crazy glasses still enough.
|CAPCOM|Okay, let me read you some questions about F crater if you will. If you'll direct your attention to F crater, we'd like to know the shape of the crater profile, the rim crest and probable or possible breaching, the smoothness and distribution of rim deposits and tlio superposition re 1atiionship with Family Mountain or Family Hill.
|SC|Okay. Now those - it is a - by golly there is a raised rim to it. It's light colored down inside the crater though. And I can't hold the glasses close enough to see if it's breached or not. SQ1God, I can't see any more, but let me add to it what I can remember real quick, the inside is white, the outside is red with a it's just a - the rim itself is dard, very dark, there s some white to the south about a crater diameter, sort of a - small distribution radially to the south and then there's a sort of a what I would call a pre-patterned dark light gray about 2 crater diameters maybe 3 crater diameters, to the south just slightly to the west of this light area were talking about, but to the south, another definite one to the west and another definite one to the north, but not to the east.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 14:34 GET 209:42 817/3
209:42:00|CAPCOM|You just past pan camera, T stop time guys. Jack, pan camera to standby, please. Go on Gene, sorry to interrupt.
|SC|Just got it.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, go ahead with your description
|SC|I going to draw a picture here while I'm thinking of it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good show. Hey, guys, that com pleted the orbital science visual pass. Are there any other comments you'd want to make about the landing site. g q1Yeah. It's an interesting place.
|CAPCOM|Naw, not that. Geological -
|SC|Yeah, I've got some more - well my white spot there is (garbled) the same spot, there's two white spots I'm talking about. Now the one I'm talking about primarily is the one I saw right after landing, on the thing was a lighter grayish area that was evidently blown up from the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 14:44CST 209:52GET 818/1
209:52:00|SC|Top of the LM landing does that go on the same spot? You can still see that all right.
|CAPCOM|We'd like pan camera power to OFF now.
|SC|Okay, it's OFF. CAPCO M1Okay, Ron, anytime you're ready now I've got a - that whole series of flight plan updates and I've got a few words of explanation with each one so maybe you might want to take these.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, high gain to AUTO.
|SC|High gain's in AUTO.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, one more question, how large is the bright zone you were talking about, Ron?
|SC|Right between Sherlock and Camelot there are two small craters there and I'll have to get my map out to look up the name of them for sure. Oop - they should have been behind the LM - right behind the LM. And the bright spot is about the same size as those.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And I would say equilateral triangle with those two craters.
|CAPCOM|Okay, fine. I would recommend one of you go on to the configured camera while we start the Flight Plan update. We'd like to get the Flight Plan update all read prior to that P52 that you've got to do there, and somebody will be taking those terminator photos.
|SC|Okay, soon as Gene, Gene's drawing the flight plan there. Okay, ready for a Flight Plan update.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Who's going to take the terminator photos. You want me to give you call about 2 minutes before the photo time?
|SC|Yes. Jack will.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well, here's the Flight Plan update. At 210:30 add the following: mapping camera OFF, wait 30 seconds mapping camera stand by, image motion OFF, laser altimeter OFF, select POO POO, V (garble) 49 maneuver to UV scan attitude. The angles are as follows: 167, 125, 354. Over.
|SC|Okay. Mapping camera off. This is at 210:30. Mapping camera OFF. Wait 30 seconds mapping camera to stand by, image motion to OFF, laser altimeter OFF, POO, V49 to UV scan attitude. Roll 167, pitch 125, yaw 354.
|CAPCOM|Good call, Ron. The next one is at 210:35 and this is a P20 maneuver that's going to set up a rotation about the X axis for a UV scan. You copy?
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|P20, option 2, UV scan. NOUN 78 all zeros 000. NOUN 79 minus 0.4000 plus 000.50, NOUN 34 0021000042019.00. Ove r.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 209:52 CST 14:44 MC818/2

|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|SC|Minus 0.4000. Okay, then dead band is at .5 and a half degrees. NOUN 34 is 2104219.00.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Ron. Okay, at 210:41.
|SC|Okay , 210 : 41.
|CAPCOM|Add the line, the standard line, verify DSE tape motion, high bit rate record forward command reset.
|SC|Okay, at 41, verify tape motion high bit rate record forward command reset.
|CAPCOM|Roger. At 210:57, you've got another P20, Ron. And this P20 will set up the orb rate minus sight on the horizon. Okay, here's the P20, option 5. NOUN 78 plus 16201, let me read that again, plus 162.01 plus 040.76 plus 184.78. NOUN 79 plus 000.50 and we're going to orb rate around the Moon, so NOUN 70 will have a 50 in it for the Moon.
|SC|Okay, at 57, it will be P20 option 5. Now, orb rate minus sight on horizon, NOUN 78's a plus 162.01 plus 40.76 and plus 184.78. NOUN 79 a half degree and it'll be orb rate around the Moon 50. Okay?
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. Okay. Stand by.
|SC|Bob, while I'm standing by, oh, that's allright.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We're ready with some more if you are .
|SC|Okay, go.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 211:02. Add the following at 211:02: UV cover closed, and in parenthesis put 2110209. Configure DSE ^
|SC|Good, we1re going to close ... oh, ... That s allright, go1ahead.
|CAPCOM| Configure DSE, stop/command reset. Select POO. Manual roll left to a roll angle 039 by 21105. Over.
|SC|Okay, UV cover closed at 2110209. Configure the DSE stop command reset. Whip her into POO and manually roll it to 039
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 14:54 GET 210:02 MC 819/1
210:02:00|SC|REV to POO and then we roll that to 039 by 211 plus 05.
|CAPCOM|Rog. And just the prediction from the simulator, you might want to use the excell command for a rate of about 1 degree per second to accomplish that. And the purpose of that is to get the sun out of the mapping camera.
|SC|Okay. Can do, excell command to 1 degree. per second .
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 211:08.
|SC|Just a second, Gordy. Hey, Jack on here it shows the little circles on the map, which part (garble) pretty soon? REV 2 or what ever it is.
|CAPCOM|One REV -t
|SC|Except for some reason, my map D doesn t - Yeah. On map DELTA. I must have got the backup map or something, I didn't have any of the portable - the camera settings, on it. (Laughter). Terminator hose -^
|CAPCOM|Ron, we can break from this now, we re pretty well ahead now, and we can come back to it, if you want to do the photos1,
|SC|Do you have any options there on La Hire Rille? And if not La Hire, what the photo settings are.
|CAPCOM|Roger, I'll read them to you right off the map.
|SC|Okay1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, if you're looking right at the map, draw a circle around La Hire BRAVO. And that is F-32
|SC|Oh, I've got the circle around it.
|CAPCOM|1 5 00.
|SC|Good. F-32, 1 500. Okay, start with that one Jack1,
|CAPCOM|Got the circle around MT LaHire, it s F-li1,
|SC|250 millimeters lens. - F—11, okay.
|CAPCOM|At the next circle up, which crosses, which encompasses the La of La Hire Rills, you want F-8 at 1 250.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And the one that crosses the circle that covers across the terminator there, at Diophantus, is F-5.6 at 1125th, 1125th.
|SC|Okay, we got them all, Bob. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just a question for some other period where we have to (garble) that for P-66 and P-74 REVS, .
|SC|Yeah. Don't have anything on this map.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 14:54 GET 210:02 MC-819/2
210:02:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll schedule that in prior to those REVS, Ron.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, we're coming up on Timocharis, now. Look at the map there and get me, right along the La Hire Rill, see -
|SC|Take 6 6 6 shots you know, kind a in each area at that - yeah, north and south. Yeah, you know point them every which way, or whatever1s interesting out the re . Okay .
|SC|Okay. Mt. La Hire, you can get in there at F-ll at 1 500.
|CAPCOM|Hey, Ron. Just a point. -
|SC|There's (garble) coming up there. Okay, go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Do you have 2 copies of the maps onboard, and if so, would the other copy of D have the updates on it? Or have the settings?
|SC|Got 2 copies? I didn't know we had 2 copies. Okay, and then next to order we've got F-8 at 1 250 (garble). There's ah, well we're just about - Okay, we're just about up there, On the terminator line. Yeah. No, F-8 at 250. Okay. North and south along terminator. You're getting close to it. Then, change to - right on the . terminator change to F—5 .6 to 122. I was wondering when you guys were going to say that. (Laughter). Okay.
|SC|(Laughter) Yeah, that'll be a good one. I'll tell you it goes a lot easier when you're by yourself.
|SC|Okay, 1 MAG 55, I mean frame 5 5 and MAG Romeo, Romeo.
|SC|Yeah, we'didn't get some of the ones up around La Hire. We'll get those next time around.
|CAPCOM|How's the pictures going, Ron?
|SC|Okay, We got the pictures of Rover. And, that's Lunar Rover Chart DELTA. It doesn't have anything on it, you know, got the circles on it, but don't have anything y et.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll - We'll schedule it up - all the updates on that after you go LOS we'll figure out some convenient time to read them up to you on the other round.
|SC|Okay, and we're ready to continue the flight plan.
|CAPCOM|Okay. 211:08, 211:08.
|SC|Okay. We're all set.
|CAPCOM|Ron, just one comment before we start the flight plan. You've got a 52 coming up and we want to
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 14:54 GET 21:02 MC-819/3
021:02:00|CAPCOM|make sure that gets done prior to the VERB 49 maneuver 210:30. And there is no slack on that VERB 49 maneuver at 210:30. So you'll have to get on to the 52 at about 20, but we should have enough time to get the rest of these updates up.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, at 211:08 delete the lines, mapping camera off, wait 30 seconds, mapping camera standby image motion OFF, and laser altimeter OFF. Delete those lines.
|SC|Okay, they're deleted1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 211:11, change the receive only attitude to the following: roll 039, Pitch 159, Yaw 300.
|SC|Okay at 211:11, VERB 49 will be to 039, 159 and 300.
|CAPCOM|Okay. At 211:26 we're going to do a P-20 maneuver and it's going to be a rolling P-20 which will roll about the OMNI BRAVO line of sight to the Earth. We'll need high bit rate during that time. That's why we need the - line of BRAVO and we're doing the Earth study with the lunar sounder to determine the polarization of the noise from the Earth. So we can subtract it out of our Data. And during these maneuvers you're going to see a little gimbal angle of plus or minus 65 degrees. We saw that on the simulator, but a word of caution that. You'll see a little gimbal angle plus or minus 65 degrees.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 15:04 GET 210:12 820/1
210:12:00|CAPCOM|The P20 maneuver is as follows at 211.26, P20 -
|SC|O'k ay .
|CAPCOM|— option 2 HF SCAN, NOUN 78 plus 270.00 minus 03930, NOUN 79 minus 0.3000 plus 000.50, NOUN 34 is all zero s.
|SC|Hold it there Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, roger.
|SC|I got your NOUN, I got fouled in the NOUN 78's. Plus I'm going to need two of those so it's NOUN 78 is plus 270.00 and a minus 039.30. Okay, your NOUN 79 are now say again.
|CAPCOM|Minus 0.3000.
|SC|Okay, three tenths of a degree per second.
|CAPCOM|Roger, .5, .5 after have to (garble).
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And, NOUN 34s are all zeros.
|SC|Okay* so your going to pro at 211:26 then, right.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay. f
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron this next one actually we re calling it 212:20, but the simulator came out at 212:18:40 just for information. And at the following stop scan at roll 039.
|SC|Okay, stop scan at roll 039.
|CAPCOM|Rog, verb 49 maneuver to lunar sounder receive only attitude. Roll 142 pitch 286 yaw 0.
|SC|Okay, verb 49 lunar sounder receive only, roll 142, pitch 286, yaw 01 ', *.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and the last one is 213-03 configure the DSE high bit1rate record forward man reset.
|SC|Okay, at 213 was that 03?
|CAPCOM|03 that is affirm.
|SC|Configure DSE high bit rate record forward command. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay -
|SC|For the high bit rate record forward plan reset.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we'll be - no more flight plan up dates we promise today and we'll be working —
|SC|Laughter.
|CAPCOM|- at delta getting that updated to you, but everybody here thinks there's two maps onboard and I think you're right. I think there is only one in there.
|SC|Oh really -
|CAPCOM|FAO thinks there is two.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 15:04 GET 210:12 820/2
210:12:00|SC|Oh wait a minute. Jack said they put an extra one - okay well there were two. Jack just said he had one put on for him. I must have picked his up or something.
|CAPCOM|Okay, rog.
|SC|Mine must be in there somewhere. We'll . lo ok for it .
|CAPCOM|Okay, if you'll check that and tell us if we need to update you. We'll still plan the update, but if you've got it fine.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And it looks like you ought to be getting in your P52 when you get a chance here.
|SC|Yes, I'll get her down here. (Huming). Can't tell about these geologists. They put on extra maps in your spacecraft and things like that you know. I gave1' you the last frame number on that romeo romeo, but I think I forgot to tell you the one after the other one. Oh, by the way on the other one Agassiz was completely in the darkness and there was no crater rim at all to shine down on Agassiz so we'didn't get him at all.
|CAPCOM|We copy that.
|SC|Oh, are we in P20 go free. We use to be in P20 - let's go back into P20. Not much but (garble).
|SC|They go right along here. I have them right along here it showed them down over there is what they used to do with them. (Garble) called get into auto now see the auto deadband.
|SC|Okay, are we at - AGS going and every thing okay go CMC free now. Okay. That's my fault Gene I should have gotten it. (Laughter). That's right - number 12 Rigel hey I can find Rigel I bet you. There she comes. There's Orion. Man oh man I've done P52 already and it's within the half of the crosshair with - come on Alphard. Ah ha there's Alphard - on rev 62. Fine there baby.
|SC|Well up to my usual tricks (laughter). Ah, 12 and 21 - thrust forward 21, triangle difference five balls. Okay, Houston there is the NOUN 93's.
|CAPCOM|Rog, we copied them down.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 15:14 GET 210:22 MC821/1
210:22:00|AMERICA|Okay, and we'll torque them at 2245.
|CAPCOM|We copy.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Here's the auto now.
|AMERICA|Yeah, just a second, Gene. Let me look at it. See resolve (garble), (garble) power is off. Those the old optics? Yeah. (Laughter) Outstanding idea having a great drink. (Laughter) Okay, 24. (Garble) Okay.
|CAPCOM|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Say again.
|AMERICA|Okay. Hey, Bob, how many frames of Mag RR do we have to diddle with? Got a -- our own, or are there any?
|CAPCOM|That's in work right now.
|AMERICA|Okay. Uh huh, here's another Chart D.
|CAPCOM|I do owe you a consumables status yet, and -
|AMERICA|Hey, you know -- put all the stuff in it. Hey, do we — we have a good chart Delta.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Good. Great. I owe you a consumables status, and when you woke up, you were right on the flight plan line, and you had 58 percent remaining of RCS. And, all other consumables are on the line or above.
|AMERICA|Okay. Hey, Bob. Sorry we'didn't let you get that in. We're not moving too fast for you, are we? (Laughter)
|CAPCOM|Uh, Ron, you have zero spares on RR. No -- no film available for yourself on RR.
|AMERICA|Oh, okay. We'll--^
|AMERICA|Hey, Bob, this is Jack. If you can possibly swing it, I would strongly recommend that we let Ron redo that last terminator sequence if we can work it in the flight plan. Because Gene and I may or may not have done what you wanted there, and I know we missed the first couple of them.
|AMERICA|I'll -- I'll use the 35 millimeter. I still got about 8 or 10 frames on the 35. (Garbled)
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll take that word under advisement, and we'll evaluate it.
|AMERICA|Thank you. We may have to send you to the U.N. with that diplomacy.
|CAPCOM|Thanks a lot for your confidence, Geno.
|AMERICA|Garble. (Laughter)
|AMERICA|Glad to hear your voice down there, Bob.
|AMERICA|Garble.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston. Mapping camera is off.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we suggest you start that VERB 49 maneuver at 210 30, or you'll be behind the eight ball there on time.
|AMERICA|Okay, image motion is coming off. Laser altimeter is coming off.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 210:32 CST 15:24 MC822/1
210:32:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. You're looking real good here coming up to LOS and we'll see you at 211:22. You look good.
|SC|Okay. Will do.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal. Apollo 17 spacecraft America has gone behind the Moon nearing the end of revolution number 62. It will reappear again in about 48 minutes on revolution 63. Presently the orbit measures 62.4 by 65.2. Cabin pressure was holding steady at 4.8 pounds per square inch aboard the spacecraft America. The crew busily running some photographic assignments, both with the Hand cameras in the cabin and the mapping and panorama camera is back in the SIM bay of the Service Module. Members of the white team of flight controllers beginning to drift in to replace the off going gold team. And at 210 hours 39 minutes, Ground Elapse Time, this is Apollo Control.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 16:14 CST 211:21 GET 823/1
211:21:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 211 hours 21 minutes. We are about 1 minute now from regaining radio contact with Apollo 17 as it comes around the eastern rim of the Moon on it's 63rd revolution. Here in Mission Control we've completed a shift handover. The Flight Director on this shift is Charles Lewis and our Spacecraft Communicator is Astronaut Gordon Fullerton. Flight Director Chuck Lewis has completed a status review for each of his flight controllers and from all around the room a — reports of everything nominal come back. During this shift two things of interest will be the firing of the explosive charges left on the lunar surface by the astronauts to SS scientists and determining the sub-surface structure. The first of these charges, designated charge No. 6 is scheduled to be detonated at about 212 hours 51 minutes. There is some latitude in this event and because of that we'll have the television camera on the lunar Rover up early to catch the event as - at it's earliest possible occurrence, which would be 212 hours 21 minutes and will leave it up through 213 hours 21 min utes.
|SC|Ah, yeah, just checking to see how the weather was doing there in Houston before you came into work.
|CAPCOM|Ah, it's kinda - bunch of high clouds cirrus, I guess, but it's down around 35 I'd say and pretty windy. So it's nippy when you're outside.
|SC|Ahhha. And Houston, how's my biomed looking?
|CAPCOM|About 10 seconds to your (garbled)
|SC|Okay, thank you.
|CAPCOM|America, we'd like the IR cover closed and I think there might be a chance the sun will get in it there.
|SC|Oh, and away we go.
|SC|Okay ?
|SC|Okay, Gordy, and we're (garbled)
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ron, your EKG looks good. The surgeon wandered how the irritation that you had mentioned because of the sensors, is it getting any better?
|SC|Well, it's - yeah, it gets better when you take 'em off and leave it off for a while and I put the cream on and looks like it lasts for about a day and every time I put it on I put it on at a different spot. And it takes about a day for it to get red and irritated.
|SC|And Gordo, for information that's not unique, we're all having that and taking 'em off is the best relief for it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 16:14 CST 211:21 GET 823/2
211:21:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, I've got some words about what you might use for optional corruptional photographs. Over.
|SC|Okay, yeah, let's write it down there.
|SC|Why don't you write it on the back page or something like that so we'll know where it is.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Ready to copy,
|SC|Okay, magazine RR has no spare frames so if you want to take any photos, we are suggesting the dac and the 75 mm lens, and using JJ which is very high speed black and white. 98 percent of JJ is unscheduled. Here's some settings you may use for terminator photo-. graphs over Mare use T 2.8 1/500 and infinity For terminator over Highlands use T 4 1/500 and infinity. And for Tsiolkovsky on rev 74, that's GG at 232 58, that s some time in the future here. We're suggesting using T 5.6 1/500 and infinity. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, what was the F stop for the Highlands on the terminator? CAPCOMT1Okay, the Highlands terminator is T 4
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 211:31 CST 16:24 MC824/1
211:31:00|SC|Okay, Gordo, what was the F dot for the highland terminator1hi hlands terminator would be T4 I guess that's the far side terminator, and the near side terminator is over mare. That's the mare setting.
|SC|Okay1, _ . ,
|SC|. Hello Houston, America. Is today Friday doWn 
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I'm sorry. Say again please
|SC|Just wondering, Gordo, if today is Friday.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. It's Friday.
|SC|Okay, thank you.
|CAPCOM|Happens to be pay day. It's the 15th.
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston. We see no need for you to wear any of1your Biomed sensors, if you'd rather take them o , give your skin a rest. Feel free1T'ii wait-
|SC|Okay, Gordy I've done that. And I 11 wait till my next time and put them on then.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 16:33 GET 211:40 825/1
211:40:00|SC|Gordie, how do you read LMP?
|CAPCOM|Loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|In a relatively quiet period, we're going to make a few comments about some of the things that cross the two big basins that we're getting very familiar with or actually three. Smythii, Crisium and Serenitatis and the degradation of the balls of the major ring and the lack of any obvious blanket structures. I think in contrast the Imbrium and Orientale which we've also had a pretty good look at Orientale and Earth shine on the earlier revs is quite striking - that contrast is quite striking to me at any rate. Also, within Orientale at least at the southeast -on the east southeast portions of the mare floor. The wrinkle ridge system is not nearly as well developed, but there is a wrinkle ridge system that roughly forms an inner floor ring at any rate.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The front of the major ring at Crisium are strikeingly different than those of the Apennines just . In their general slopes - sharpness of topographical features. And in any appearance of having even a hint of boulder fields on their slopes like we observed say on the south massif anything like that at least Serenitatis massif seems to locally show fairly major boulder fields on their flanks. And, I haven't seen any around Crisium yet maybe Ron's already talked to you about that, but I haven't; seen any.
|CAPCOM|Okay1.
|SC|Ah yeah, the craters now I'm speaking of the, Ron, of the front faces themselves. The rim - the face of the ring itself.
|SC|Oh, I see the ring itself okay, that's what you're talking about.
|SC|No a - it crater - fresh crater in the mare or a fresh crater in the blanket area - rim area will have boulders, Gordie, don't misunderstand me but the front faces the ring front face does not have boulders that I can see. And, I think boulders are pretty obvious when their there. We've seen them well defined on the central peaks of Seaquosky and I think any time you have a major boulder field you can see it with the minocular - with a 10 power minocular.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Getting into areas that resemble in their surface texture the Sculptured Hills of the Taurus Littrow landing area. Here we're just passing - now where are we that would be. I got disoriented all of the sudden - Poculus is there. So it's in the ray exclused zone of Poculus where
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 16:33 GET 211:40 825/2
211:40:00|SC|there is a mare surface projecting up into the terrain it looks like Sculptured Hills and that mare has the distinct blueish gray color in contrast to the regolith associated with the Sculptured Hills between the Hills at least which is - let's call it a tanish gray. Quite a sharp color hue contrast to my eyes at any rate.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, that was a projection of Fecunditatis Mare I guess up in there. Sculptured Hills tend to have both a regional distribution and a structurally controlled distribution. The structurally - structural control being apparently related to the rims of old craters. For example, there is some sculptured hills appearing topographic materials that again in the ray excluded zone but out in Fecunditatis we find the rim of a fairly large flooded crater in Fecunditatis. And all of this may tie in with the possible - possibility that we saw at the landing site that Sculptured Hills are composed of an igneous gabbroic rock and these may represent local intrusions controlled by the structure of an old impact crater - extrusions controlled by the structure of the old impact crater.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I've noticed now I'm getting a good view of where at Fecunditatis there is tannish - let's call it more of a brownish gray mare in contrast to blueish gray mare in Fecunditatis itself.
|CAPCOM|Roger.-
|SC|And in the walls of some - of a large crater, I'll try to figure out which one it is in a minute. It's near the large crater that the Sculptured Hills define. You can see in the east wall or maybe northeast wall of that crater. An area of bluish gray material that is streaking the normal tan gray of that crater wall.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 16:43 GET 211:50 MC826/1
211:50:00|CAPCOM|This is a kind of one-sided discussion. I ___. wish I was there so I could take a more active part.
|SC|That's all right. I just thought I'd fill in a few things. This isn't a good viewing attitude at all, and we get a few isolated views that may be worth commenting on. The contrast, in my eye anyway, between the three color units around the landing site is a -- let's call it a medium blueish grey to grey for the dark mantle; a light blue—grey for the annulus around Serenitatis; and then, a tan-grey for the Serenitatis Mare proper. And, in Dawes, you can see — I think1. . you can see that the overturned — or the, the rim materials are made up of the brownish grey material, and the walls underneath those rims are the blueish grey, which is the age relationship suggested by topography. That'd be the lower unit in forming the rim with inverted stratigraphy.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The light blue-grey annulus is also the locus of most of the circumferential grabens that Serenitatis is noted for is in that area. And, that's nothing new, but, in one place there's a very subdued flooded crater which seems to control a a arcuate project — or let's say a circular projection of the light blue-grey out over the tan-grey Mare. Most of the major wrinkle .ridge system of Serenitatis, of course, is outside the annulus of blue-grey except locally, and one of those places was in the — to the west of the Taurus-Littrow site. Although that wrinkle ridge system does — I can see now as we look south of — in the southern portions of Serenitatis that wrinkle ridge system does cross the contact between the blue-grey and the tan-grey. That's the light blue-grey and the tan-grey.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|The impression I've had in looking at all the Mare where the wrinkle ridge system are developed is that they're a late feature. They — at least at low sun, and sometimes even at high sun, they have a very, very sharply defined ridges with steep slopes on either side that seem — that, in general, give me the impression that they're constructional, possibly associated with some thrusting movement.
|SC|In the vicinity of Sulpicius Gallus, there are several small craters that look like impact craters that, believe it or not, have — in my eye anyway, orange ejecta blankets.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Yeah. Ron says that he — that he already commented on those, and they look very obvious to me. No, I -don't know, no, I don't think you can with those ones. We'll get a good view of them again in one of the other attitudes.
|SC|It's a light orange, obviously, not a — that is in contrast to the brown-grey of the dark mantle in the vicinity of Sulpicius Gallus. There's a good one right down there. Now, that one looks like a constructional cone, that's orangeish. And, that's — that's right out on a raised projection of the -- of the brown—grey dark mantle out onto the — out onto the light blue-grey annulus material.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 16:43 GET 211:50 MC826/2
211:50:00|SC|This southern and southwestern portion of Serenitatis has a general appearance of the Sculptured Hills, although the individual hills seem to be more widely spaced than around Taurus-Littrow. Once again, historically, we're passing over the landing site of Apollo — or near the landing site of Apollo 15.
|SC|Tell Dave Scott that the north complex looks just as interesting as it ever did. It's going to remain with Emory Crater as one of the unknowns of the space program for awhile, I guess.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, Gordo, I've been looking at the landing site off and on the last few revs, and I'd like to get — now that we've been there and back, your best guess of the exact position of what you think we landed. Because I think I've got it pinpointed pretty much though from here.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Stand by one.
|PAO|That question on the landing site location coming from Eugene Cernan.
|SC|This is one of the first opportunities that I've had to look closely at Archimedes, which is one of those craters that, in the early days of the lunar mapping program, helped establish some of the fundamental age relationships between the various units that were visible in the Earth-based photography. In this particular case, it related to the sequence of events that created Imbrium, cratered it, and then flooded it with Mare. And Archimedes is a completely circular - closed circle as a crater, and it is filled with Mare. And it in itself is superimposed on the — one of the main benches of the Imbrium Crater.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 16:53 CST 212:00 GET 827/1
212:00:00|SC|Now, to have Mare filling that crater and actually filling all the depressions of approximately the same level in the vicinity of Mare - the large Mare region.  It's one of the things that's suggested to many people that rather than single sources for Mare lavas, you have a multitude of sources in a very fractured lunar crust. Ultimate source in depth is still certainly a subject for controversy1,
|SC|The ridge and valley structure of the Archimedes impact blanket is not covered by Mare and extends to the southeast out onto the Imbrium bench. That was also one of the pieces of evidence used in those early days of photo-geologic maping of the Moon. You'll have to excuse the reminiscing, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Rog1i r i j
|SC|And Houston, America, frame 150, lbl ana 152 were taken of the Silphecius-Galois region with a 250 lens. 154 was taken at de Guldara and that's magazine Oscar Oscar.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. p^O1This is Apollo Control at 212 hours 2 minutes and we've within the last couple of minutes had a report from the ALSEP officer here that we're seeing seismic activity on the seismic profiling experiment which indicates that our first charge may have detonated early, either tha^ or a meteorite has struck within range to be recorded on the instrument and we'll be checking that first grenade charge 6, which is a one pounder, was scheduled to have been detonated at 212 hours 51 minutes. It does have a mechanical timer and from past experience we know that mechanical timer to have some variability and when it opens the window allowing a continuous firing command to get through and fire the charge.
|SC|Bessel in Serenitatis that Ron and I were looking at last night and I think he had commented on being layers in the ledges that were visible in the walls and I certainly concur with that1, 2C1Yeah, although we could not trace layers,individual layers from ledge to ledge within a coherent ledge the layers were traceable, and in one case I m sure I could count 6 or 7 ledges, some - well, layers within a single ledge. Reason it reminded me of it was looking at Timacharis an I can not do that with Timocharis.
|SC|It looks like it's - those ledges, any ledges that may have been present as a result of the Imbrium Mare have since disappeared by weathering. That's lunar weathering of course. Of course down here in the Imbrium, southern Imbrium, is one of the better regions of the Moon to observe the wrinkle ridge systems or Mare ridges sometimes they re called. And it's purely that, they're fairly sharply defined -quite sharply defined ridges that are wrinkled in their pattern — continuous would be another term. And with sharply defined slopes on either side of the ridge. Sometimes they are flat top ridges. Sometimes they are more like spines. And occasionally you see 'em they'll almost appear to have vertical slopes on one wall or the other. The whole impression that I have any way, is that they're maybe a combination of structure and folding of the surface of the Mare. Construction on the surface and folding of that surface. And particularly interesting that they can do wherever they're -has apparently been an old sub-flooded crater. Yeah, did you want to get that sum -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 16:53 CST 212:00 GET 827/2
212:00:00|SC|They seem to be controlled by the shape of flooded old craters within the Imbrium basin. And I think that's a safe conclusion because you get the standard outlines shown by the rille - the ridges, excuse me. Some of them are polygonal and some of them are quite circular.
|SC|Ron, did you want to get these ridges, these rilles south of Eulea here?
|SC|Yeah .
|SC|Okay, they're coming up.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I guess the last team promised you no changes to the flight plan but they didn t say anything about changes to the changes and I've got one. At 15 minutes from now 212
|SC|Standby a minute.
|CAPCOM|--- in the flight plan. Might get that out and I'll give you a change.
|SC|Keep talking, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 212:20, you're to stop the roll at 39 degrees, and then do a VERB 49 to 142 and we want to change the PITCH to 268 and zero. That would be 142, 268 and zero.
|SC|Okay, I got that change and you want that about 18 - 212:18.
|CAPCOM|I - have to check back here. Yeah, I guess that's when it is.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Also, as long as you've got the book and a pencil let me give you a few other one liners.
|SC|Yeah, I can operate and copy.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Let's see. The first one is at 214:55 and they want to add after that other stuff just above there: UV cover OPEN and IR cover OPEN.
|SC|Okay, at 214:55 you want UV and IR covers OPEN.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 16:53 CST 212:00 GET 827/3
212:00:00|CAPCOM|Rog. Turn the page at 215:37, change magazine November November to Kilo Kilo.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And, the reason I'm so slow in an answer on that landing site position, is all I've got it in is latitude and longitude, and I assume that you want it in good coordinates. For your reference. One suggestion here was you tell us and then we'll confirm your guess. I just ran across couple updates. Back to 213:15 in the flight plan I'll give you the lunar sounder pads, the two of 'em on that page.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 17:02 GET 212:10 MC-828/1
212:10:00|SC|Okay, I'll get them. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. T-start on the left hand one there, is 213 20 10 and T-stop is 213 24 20. Then the next one is, T-start of 213 41 40 and a T-stop of 213 59 54. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, got them all. There all at 213 hours start is 20 10, stop 24 20, start is 41 40 and stop is 59 54.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good readback.
|SC|And, Gordo, I guess my best guess after looking down there from here is I've got a — the northeast chart of the lunar surface traverse (garble). And about 84. - correction about 83.3 and DELTA .5. We're right on the top of the o in Poppy. Looks to be about where we landed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got that.
|SC|And in thinking back, about what my intentions were, that looks like probably a very reasonable, reasonable suggestion, and the first thought I had about being close to Trident, I didn't think I was anywhere near that close and of course you can look out there and see a big hole, you don't know how big to dig when you're down there. That big hole out there might very easily could have been Poppy out at 9 o'clock.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, from science we finally got it converted to your map coordinates and their guess was close. Their best guess with all the data considered is, 83.2 and DN 21, Delta, November 21.
|SC|That would definitely make sense -.
|SC|That's pretty close to where the old LMP set up the first REG after landing, isn't it.
|SC|- north of where we put the - remember it was a little ways away, you were at the edge of a depression and it would (garble)
|SC|Yeah, I'll buy that. That's in my scatter and then that crater as I looked out at 9 o'clock we landed next to was actually Poppy. Pretty sure that's that large crater.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And, Houston, America. On MAG Yankee, Yankee, use frames 31 thru 35, at that last Earth site terminator there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Got that.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. There is some debate in the Control Center at this time as to whether or not that first explosive charge did in fact fire early, or whether the seismic profiling experiment was instead a reacting on natural phenomenon, such as a meteorite impact or a Moon quake and we have brought up the television camera on the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 17:02 GET 212:10 MC-828/2
212:10:00|PAO|Lunar Rover early and we'll be looking at the area and attempting to draw some conclusions as to whether the aft charge did in fact go early or whether it's still in place. Now that question could be answered quite easily if the charge, of course, explodes on command as it's scheduled to at about 212 hours, 51 minutes. And that first charge is 1-pound explosive charge about 1.1 kilometer from the Lunar Rover.
|SC|Gordo, I'm just going to stop this maneuver this time around at 39 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene. Say, we've got one question for Ron. We've got large teams of engineers trying to locate the missing sissors and we haven't asked you in a while whether you might have found them. It might save them a lot of effort down here.
|SC|No, I haven't found them yet. And there's a lot of room underneath these C02 absorbers I found out the other night. Because, I lost my flash light but it's kindof floated out and I saw it every once in awhile. And, we found the flash light and got it back. But I still haven't the slightest idea where the scissors are.
|SC|Gordo, you might have someone hide them in the CSM and send a backup crew down to the Cape and see how long it takes them to find them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll get an airplane schedule up right away.
|SC|I've just been 39 degrees, I'll wait for it next time around.
|SC|By the way Gordy, you working on next week's airplane schedule?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, what do you need? You mean the one from Hawaii back, or something like that?
|SC|Yeah, you might have some 38s waiting for us in LA, we can pick them up there.
|CAPCOM|Okay, but we'll have to work it three ways, swap with some Skylab troops that will be out there and Deke will meet you in Albuquerque half way back, and I'll let you know how it all works out.
|SC|That sounds great. That sounds like easier than usual.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have a Press Breifing scheduled with the flight director from the previous shift, Neil Hutchenson. And that Press Breifing is scheduled to begin in about 5 minutes at 5:15 PM in the MSC News Center Breifing Room.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 17:12 GET 212:19 829/1
212:19:00|SC|Every commander has the right to change his mind.
|SC|And, Gordie I'll watch the cranapple.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 212 hours 28 minutes. We are ready to switch to the MSC news center briefing room for the press conference press briefing with flight director Neil Hutchinson. There is a possibility that during this briefing we'll have the detonation of the first seismic charge now on the lunar surface. If that occurs we'll interrupt the press briefing to announce the firing of that charge. We'll switch now to the MSC news center and our press briefing.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 17:32 GET 212:38 MC830/1
212:38:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 212 hours 39 minutes. During our press briefing, we had loss of signal with the command module. Also, we'did not have the detonation of the seismic charge. We have about 2 minutes of tape of conversation with the crew before loss of signal. We'll play that back at this time, and, of course, we'll interrupt if we should get the firing of th e grenade.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We're starting to get to the margin of our signal strength to get the data back. We want you to improve that by turning S-band mode, S-band normal mode voice switch to (garble) for about 5 minutes.
|SC|Say again,
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to turn the S-band normal mode voice switch to "Off Center" for about 5 minutes to improve our signal margin as you approach the terminus -- the LOS here .
|SC|Okay, "Off Center" for 5 minutes.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Don't bother to answer, but we'd like H2 Tank 2 fans off. That's Hydrogen Tank 2, fans off.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Bravo.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, you can turn the voice back on now. Have about a minute and a half to LOS for a final goodby e.
|SC|Okay, this is America with —
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've just had a report from ALSEP that one of the bombs went off. we'didn't see it on television, but we are beginning to see some seismic activity and we'll switch now on our television monitor to the seismic tracing, let you — let you look at that.
|PAO|No one here in the Control Center observed on the television the detonation of that charge. However, we are planning to replay the tape from that time and see if a close look at the tape shows any -- any activity that we can see on the television camera.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It's going to take several minutes before we're ready to rerun the video tape of that time segment when the explosive charge detonated. In the meantime, we'll continue with our tape playback leading up to loss of signal with America on the 63rd revolution.
|SC|Okay, this is America with a goodbye for this p ass .
|CAPCOM|Okay, I guess the real reason for having you turn the voice switch off there so the secretaries that are transcribing the air-to-ground here can catch up with Jack.
|SC|Ha, ha. I don't believe it. Yes, I do. Okay, that's all you ever hear from me again.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 17:32 GET 212:38 MC830/2
212:38:00|PAO|That brings us up to date now with all of the air-to-ground that we've received from the crew up through loss of signal. We'll be reacquiring Apollo 17 in about 36 minutes.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The time at which we copied the firing of that first explosive charge was a ground elapsed time of 212 hours 39 minutes 44 seconds, which translates to 6:32:45 Central Standard Time, or rather 5:32:45 Central Standard Time. And, we should be ready shortly to rerun the video tape from that segment of the television. And, again ' looking very closely to see if the charge explosion is visible on the TV, The charge was placed about 1.1 kilometers from the lunar rover, and it was the 1-pound charge.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 17:42 GET 212:49 831/1
212:49:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 212 hours 56 minutes. We've had some unexpected activity on the lunar seismic experiment. And the ALSEP controller reports that there is a lot of activity in the ALSEP room looking at the very active seismic tracings that we are getting right now. Some feeling that this may, in fact, represent the detonation of that grenade rather than the previous signal that we recorded. If in fact that is the case we missed it on the television because the television camera was pointed at another area at the time that activity began. And, as soon as we have a further report from ALSEP we'll pass that along to you. \
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 17:52 GET 212:59 MC-832/1
212:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control we've had no further word from the ALSEP Control area as to which of the 2 seismic events we registered at the Apollo 17 site represents the firing of the first charge. However, it is noted that the second event came much closer to the anominal charge firing time.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we've concluded right here in the Control Center that the second seismic event, registered on the Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment, was in fact the one pound explosive charge going off. Tthat occurred, at 212 hours 55 minutes 35 seconds, which was about 4-1/2 minutes later than the nominal or T-0 time. There will be a second charge fired. It is scheduled for 2 15 hours 27 minutes, that will be a 1/2-pound charge that is located 6/10 of a kilometer from the Lunar Roving Vehicle. We're now some 14 minutes from reacquiring Apollo 17 in its 64th revolution of the Moon. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 18:13 GET 213:20 833/1
213:20:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 213 hours 20 minutes. We're standing by now to reacquire Apollo 17 in its 64th revolution of the Moon. And we expect this at least from the crew work point of view to be a relatively quiet period. During this revolution they are scheduled to begin their eat period. And they will be operating some of the scientific instruments in the scientific instrument module bay the SIM bay. But, relatively little scheduled in the flight plan during this period of time. We show the spacecraft in an orbit of 65.3 nautical miles at its high point, and a low point or pericynthion of 62.4 nautical miles. And, we should have acquisition of signal any second now.
|PAO|And we've had acquisition of signal. And, it will take a second before we get good solid lock up.
|SC|Yes.
|SC|Hey Ron do you want me?
|SC|That's right there's a lot of those with the platform have got to be a lava type thing down there.
|PAO|And we've got a good solid signal now from the spacecraft - good data. Hearing Ron Evans in the background. Ron apparently has his mike in the so called VOX mode where it's triggered by a voice.
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Roger America hello once again. You've got about 1 minute to T stop.
|SC|Okay, we're right with you Gordie.
|SC|Okay. T stop is it - 24 20. Stand by, okay .
|SC|Okay, we're coming up on 24 20. The visual of Tsiolkovsky is hopefully pretty much recorded on the recorder.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|18, 19 mark it - stand by. (Garble) stand by. I guess the somewhat - very small summary anyhow of the visual of Tsiolkovsky concentrating primarily on the flow from the northeast corner. To me that particular piece that's fallen down in the crater there and it's on one of the pictures Tsiolkovsky four or five. The piece that is down in the crater is on the right hand side of the page. And, that portion you know is somewhat of a molten state. It looks like it is a land slide that has slid down the wall of the crater and detached from the — rather molten state of material rough looking material that's on the rim of the crater Tsiolkovsky.
|CAPCOM|Roger Ron.
|SC|There seems to be high lava marks around the western and northern sides of the central peak. For some
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 18:13 GET 213:20 833/2
213:20:00|SC|reason it's not evident or visible on the south side of the central peak.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Also, there seems to be the high lava marks along the raised portion of the floor and the contact between the dark material on the floor and the lighter oh rough looking just before - on the northern side of the1. crater. In the first observation of the mass of material that goes out into the crater Farame. It looks like there . is a whole bunch of craters in there that have essentially rimless craters. However, on close examination with the bionocs I couldn't see any that didn't have at least a slight indication of a rim. The rims that were on them were essen- ti ally very subdued. They extended out to about oh a half a crater diameter and these are on the craters in the 500 to 1000 meter size. I didn't get a chance to look at them looking straight down the craters to see if there was any1. depressions or any domes or any type of structure in thebot tom of1; craters. I get the impression that theyjre primarily all look just of cones with no flat bottoms at all. And I'll look again at those things when we go by the next time. The flow that goes down into Waterman - if we look at the pictures Tsiolkovsky five of five the shadow is about the same area on this one as it is on that one - I didn't take a chance to look at that until I got to the west of it. So I'll have to look when I'm passing it from the north side of Tsiolkovsky looking south to see what's down in the shadow area there. When your on the west looking back across it you can't see into the shadow. But the material that's in the floor of the crater1; Waterman is the same type of material that the little flow on the northeast corner has broken off and slid down into its own little crater.
|CAPCOM|Okay roger that.
|SC|So I guess what I'm saying is that essentially1j whatever molten material that's up around on the rim of the1; crater Tsiolkovsky has been - well I want to say extruded -: not extruded but pushed out I guess away from the crater and has been in a semiliquid or semimolten state in its period of deposition - - g q1I'll reserve judgment on some of the flat- floored, flat mare-filled depressions that are around the crater until I get a change to look at those the next time around.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 18:23 GET 213:30 MC834/1
213:30:00|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Say, Gordie, something that struck me, some thing maybe everyone else has thought about, but I hadn t before. At the southeast corner of Smythii, there was a relatively large -several large somewhat subdued craters but with relatively steep sides to them, and next to this one was a very small, white, bright halo crater. And, I watched the rays of this crater, and the southeastern rays draped over the slopes of this much larger subdued crater, draped over the walls. All the way down onto the floor. And, as they draped over the walls, they obviously gave me a very good albedo change from the darker wall to the very much lighter colored. But, as they hit the floor of the crater, they form patterns that are not only — not unlike, but actually very, very similar to the light-mantled area that we have been referring to as a possible slide, back at Taurus-Littrow. The patterns as they drape down the inner slopes of the crater, and onto the floor, I would be willing to bet if we went down there we'd probably find the same type of things we found at Taurus-Littrow. By that, I mean albedo changes that we can see here versus to what we can see down there.
|CAPCOM|Roger, very interesting.
|SC|I looked for these type of — looked for these ray patterns where the rays just went out on a more horizontal plane, and you can — you can find them if you look hard, but as they drape over the slope and onto the more level floor, they re very obviously alike.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|That crater, if you look at Smythii one of one, and the craters right above the Rev 62 there, you can see a bright spot on the northwest portion over there. And that's the breech zone of that particular crater. The thing that's intriguing about that to me is that if you look at the inner ring, it's a gradual slope from the center -- the center of the crater is lower than the secondary, the secondary ring around the thing. And, while the center of the crater is low, you have a gradual — CAPC0M1Ron, let me interrupt here. Say the name of the crater you're looking at again at Smythii.
|SC|Okay, it's Smythii. And, Mare Smythii, one of one, that — that picture --
|CAPCOM|Roger, I -
|SC|And, right about where it says Rev 62. Okay?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 18:23 GET 213:30 MC834/2
213:30:00|CAPCOM|Okay, gotcha.
|SC|Now, there's two — there are two rings in that picture. Okay, and the inner ring, the central portion of that thing is lower and slopes outward, radially outward to the first ring. And, then it drops off, in other words, it's a gradual slope, maybe oh, somewhere in the 15-20 degrees slope upward to the first ring. Then it's a steep slope on the outside of the ring, at about oh, 45 degrees, dropping down into the annulus.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Have color? With 250 lens. Yeah, all along. I just took it today, two of them, three of them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I took three of them the last rev.
|SC|Gordie, this is the LMP. While we're waiting for the site to come up again, which seems to interest us every time we go over it, I think we sort of came to a general concensus on the problem of the smaller cone-shaped craters on the far side that have the little pool-like concentrations of material1. in the bottom. If you look at the breccias of those craters, the — that seems to be contiguous with the streaks of very dark material that cover the walls and the rim of the fresh coneshaped craters. As a crater gets older, that material — that distinction becomes less obvious; however, the pool remains, and all you lose is the dark streaks on the rim and on the walls of the crater. I think we sort of feel -- suspect that that pool in the bottom of the fresh craters is just the concentrated impact melt that -- some of which is -- stayed there during the impact and other which drained back —
|SC|That ought (garble)
|SC|-- that drained back after the impact from the — drained from the walls, and then, with time, that pool may be subdued some. The structures in it, the little swirls and little domes in that pool are subdued probably not only by the impact but by debris, slides and avalanches off the walls of the crater.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SC|It's getting to be a very consistent pattern when you start piecing several of them together.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|That black streaking on the walls and the blankets, Ron may have already told you, but it is characteristic of only the very freshest of those cone-shaped craters, and — or pool craters, whichever you want to call them. It seems to be very logical that it just represents a thin veneer on the rim and the walls of the impact-generated glass, and it's darkest presumably where it's quenched, and the pool itself is somewhat lighter grey than the black streaks and mantles.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 18:32 CST 213:40 GET 835/1
213:40:00|SC|Yeah, Jack, I get the impression that these bright ones, see the bright one right down there in front of us there, if you look at those with the binocs or with the - I get the impression of a dark greenish black or blackish green. In other words I get a green
|SC|Green casting '
|SC|Yeah, green cast to the rock. To the big blocks you know that are laying around there - around the crater and also the ones that are down in the bottom.
|SC|Right
|SC|That greenish cast to 'em.
|SC|Yeah, it is, isn't it. I can see that with the naked eye. That's a bright one
|SC|I say, where is the crater though?
|SC|Oh, that' s the Yerkes and -
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Hey, Gordy, we got another orange-red crater. And we'll spot it. I think everybody agreed. And this one very clearly looks like an impact crater that has it's - let's see we'decided you're looking north
|SC|Yeah.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It's north - ah - east and west quadrants
|SC|Ah - (garbled) you describe it. It's Yerkes and maybe 28 -
|CAPCOM|Hey, you got the T start time coining up very shortly. About 10 seconds.
|SC|Okay
|SC|Quit interrupting.
|SC|Okay, we'll get it.
|SC|What time is it?
|SC|We'll hack it up here Gordy.

|CAPCOM|That was close.
|SC|That was a very good call. No sweat.
|SC|Say get (garbled) map of -
|SC|Any rate in the northeast and west quadrants of that little crater and we'll spot it for you on the map is a very clearly an orange pattern - an orange color to the ejecta. The other quadrant is a lighter color light gray.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|If I had a map. What did I do with my map? I got a picture of that I think.
|SC|Ri ght here.
|SC|No, go ahead. APOLLO 17 MIS SION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 18:32 CST 213:40 GET 835/2
|SC|I can't see the landing site anyhow, I don't think.
|SC|Gordy, my impression from Shorty the other day and also from seeing these craters that seem to have orange - that are around them, that look very much like impact craters from orbit at any rate. It may be that the - if that is an alteration phenomenon, that it's being localized around the structure created by the impact. But in this latter case it looks like the impact itself penetrated into a zone of that color.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack.
|SC|(laughter) Yep.
|SC|Are we going to use your -
|SC|Here, take a look at it.
|SC|Doesn't show up that way today.
|SC|Here. The color -
|SC|Oh, oh, that's the spot.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|Can't see it any more.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 213:49 CST 18:42 MC836/1
213:49:00|AMERICA|Yes. That's a good view over there.
|AMERICA|They're between Tack A and Melanes, aren't they?
|AMERICA|Yes. I see them down there. Okay.
|AMERICA|They're little bitty one. They're about a little bit bigger than Shorty.
|AMERICA|Yes. Those are the ones that I called the other day. It was a very, very light tan. I guess you can put an orange tint to them.
|AMERICA|Gordy to put orange in to perspective, at least as far as the LMP guys are concerned from orbit, I would say that it's a orange gray, it's still a gray, with an orange hue to it. And when I use any blue or tan or anything it's a hue on gray, and I'll usually try to say gray in there, but to say something's orange, I think would be misleading. It's really an orange gray, but it's clearly a distinct hue.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Kind of like dirty beach sand, with a little orange in it, huh?
|AMERICA|Well, we can't use that term any more. That's copyrighted.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Yes. That's right. There is. That's the one. That's the area where I was trying to talk about.. That's just north of, oh that's the (garble). No, it's a couch, just yes, northwest of (garble) crater. Yes. I didn't doubt it. I didn't talk about that thing. That's a, I was talking about the little orange crater. Now you can see all the colors down in the shadows itself.
|AMERICA|Hey, Ron. We'll spot this one on the map, too, Gordy. But there's a large gouge just south of the (garble, garble) ridge. The gouge, it's a rimless depression, and streaming down from the upper portion of that depression are not only our (garble), the orange grays, but some would be a red brown gray. Very, very clear coloration in this light, in, I think, my goodness, there's another crater we'll have to 1ook at.
|AMERICA|Yes. There's a whole bunch of them down there .
|AMERICA|There's something in the wall of it in that area. Yes, it's starting, man, we're seeing an orange Moon now. Now this whole Dark Mantle in here around (garble) there're scattered craters with variety of orange to red brown hues and they all, except for that large rimless depression, looked, looked as if was exposing some layers, which were streaming those color, that color depris down it's walls. All the other craters seem to be small impacts, that apparently
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 213:49 CST 18:42 MC836/2
213:49:00|AMERICA|are penetrating just far enough Into the Dark Mantle material to tap this zone of orange to red brown material1'
|AMERICA|And just north of that elongate depression there is another circular crater, and it also is penetrating down through this mantle of stuff, and it has the reds and the browns and oranges dipping down it too. Hey, Gordy, just so you're aware we're not sort of just leaning and getting color blind up here, I tell you last one Jack was talking about was not even suttle. It's entire ray pattern was this same (garble) material and definite contact between it and the dark material around it and it had that orange brown hue Lo without any question at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Very interesting.
|AMERICA|It really is, you know I saw that dirt day before yesterday at Littrow, but, and I really haven't seen too much from orbit that I'd call really very distinct in color, until this one. But boy there's no question about this one.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|And we will pick up the lunar sounder at 59:54.

|SC|No, here's the Selvikous Galois. No, you're up too far, you're up too far. Closer to Selvikious Galois. Right in that ridge Mesa, right in there on a red line.
|SC|And, we'll get a picture of it anyway.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|(garble), yeah.
|SC|(Humming)
|SC|Okay, sorry, Houston. We turned that one off at a minute off. (Laughter)
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|We'll pick up an extra minute on the next one.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|(Humming and Laughter)
|SC|Okay, Houston. Recorder's going OFF.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Hey, Gordo. I better make this note now. What Jack and Ron were talking about apparently was A elong-gated depression. I was talking about in the same area, and I'm trying to mark it approximately on the chart. But it was a classic small bright haloed crater. The classic with a classic ejecta and everything. Except it was this orange hued-crater. It was not bright white. But it was very classic. And, as I said earlier, not subtle at all.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I have a TEI for REV 72 pad, no hurry, maybe you want to wait until sunset.
|SC|Yeah, we'll wait for sunset, okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Houston, 160 and 162, the MAG Oscar, Oscar. We're taking from the north, viewing the Central peaks of Copernicus.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|SC|It's a long ways away, I don't know if it'll show up or not. It might.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 19:00 GET 214:07 838/1
214:07:00|SC|Houston this is America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay Gordo I'm looking ahead - trying to stay ahead and see what's happening today and tomorrow in the flight plan. And although this has come up in the past we haven't said anything about it. You know Ron put his biomed harness on a couple of hours ago and he's going to end up wearing it a total of six hours then when we make a change over again and I put it on and for a twelve hour period and then we change again. And, one of the problems up here is putting these things on and you'd like not to leave them on too long but once you get them on you like to make use of them, and it's a problem, it's time consuming I'd like you to consider down there letting Ron wear wear those until tomorrow morning and let me change over then. And one EVA time comms rule take special consideration to whatever requirements there are.
|CAPCOM|Hey, you just got a thumbs up on that from the surgeon.
|SC|Okay, very good thank you.
|SC|Okay, Houston took whatever the three were before 39 on1mag yankee yankee of Euler Tobiousmyer terminator stuff.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron and for Jack the surgeon says he's getting occasional erratic trace from Jack's biomed he would be happy if Jack wants to take it clear off.
|SC|Gordie, I don't know how to tell you this but I haven't had my biomed on for about 6 hours.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|As a matter of fact I haven't even had the sensors on.
|CAPCOM|We must be copying the heart beat of the America or something.
|SC|How does it look maybe we ought to use it instead of mine.
|CAPCOM|America's ticker is doing fine - along with everything else.
|SC|Okay, Houston, this is America I've got a flight plan change for you if your ready to copy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, ready to copy.
|SC|Okay, if you'll turn to page 3-26 at 217:52.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|SC|You can delete both those steps.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I've got that.
|SC|Okay, if you'll turn to 230:40 you can cross out LMP1and put CDR.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 19:00 GET 214:07 838/2
214:07:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got that,
|SC|Ckay, if you'll turn to 230:29.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|You can change the first line cross out LMP and put1CDR, and on the second line you can cross out CDR and put CMP.-
|CAPCOM|Okay, I must be on the wrong page - did you say 230:29. Must be 231:29. Okay got you.
|SC|231:29 cross out LMP and put CDR on the first line. Cross out CDR and put CMP.
|CAPCOM|Alright.
|SC|Okay, and we'll further update you as the mission progresses. I know your pretty busy and we 11 hold any flight plan updates down to you to a minimum from up here.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 19:09 GET 214:16 MC-839/1
214:16:00|SC|Okay, Gordy. You want to give me TEI p ad?
|CAPCOM|There's nothing I'd rather do. Ready to copy?
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It's TEI for 72, SPS/G&N. 36477, plus 061 plus 083. NOUN 33 is 230 42 5917. NOUN 81 plus 28874, minus 03394 minus 00503 179 095 356 rest of the pads NA. GDC stars Sirius and Rigel 136 160 034, ullage is 4 jetts 12 seconds. Remarks assumes ascent RESFMMAT. Over.
|SC|Okay, TEI, 72, SPS/G&N. 36477 plus 061 plus 083. 230 42 59 17. plus 28874 minus 03394 minus 00503 179 095 356, Sirius and Rigel 136 160 034 ullage is 4 jetts for 12 seconds,.and it assumes an ascent REFSMMAT. Over.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's a good readback. Say, we have a little summary of both the surface and the orbital scientific equipments working, probably about 5 minutes worth. If there's some handy time, I'll be glad to read it to you.
|SC|Right now, Gordy. We'd love to hear it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, let me start with the America's gear there. The - On the UV spectrometer well, I'd say having to do with UV. Back during REV 38, they sent an Arrow bee sounding rocket from White Sands, up and it carried a UV spectrometer above the atmosphere, successfully acquired solar UV calibra— tion data. Far side terminator shows that there is an hydrogen atmosphere but it is much less than had been predicted. The PI is very happy with the mode 4 maneuver. On the IR scanning radiometer, it's still performing beautifully and the PI is getting lots of high-quality data and I understand there is ecstatic about it. On REV 33 the crater Kepler C showed up as a 132 degree kelvin anomaly when a 94-degree kelvin background. After 11.6 days of lunar night. The crater Reiner was a similar anomaly on that revolution. In low orbit on REV 9 Keppler A showed a broad hot spot corresponding to its ejecta blanket with a sharp spike corresponding to the crater in the center. One cold spot anomaly seems to correspond to a cinder cone-like feature in Mare Orientale near the crater Homan. On the lunar sounder. Telemetry monitoring of the sounders average reflected power indicates that the Mare and Highlands exhibit markedly different reflectivity both HF and VHF. The data is consistent with distinct layerings in the Mare, as would be expected were the Mare flooded by successive layers of Mare. Although, they say other explanations are possible. They don't see that layering indication in the Highlands. Predicted topographic signatures over features such as craters and
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 19:09 GET 214:16 MC-839/2
214:16:00|CAPCOM|mare ridges have been confirmed as invi sible. Of course, as you know, until they get the film back they don't have - they can't really reach any definite conclusions. On the cameras. The cameras, both cameras and the laser altimeter all appear to be performing very well and everybody's especially happy with the solid laser altimeter performance. Okay, that kind of sums up SIM BAY. Do you have any questions that I could chase down or shall I goonwithservice stuff?
|SC|No, why don't you press on.
|SC|That sounds good Gordo, press on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, on the surface, the Heat-Flow. These are little short summaries each written by the Pis or COIs on each experiment. Mark reports that the entire Heat-Flow System is working perfectly. Probes have cooled down to a temperature of minus 16 degrees centigrade at a depth of 2.3 meters. And are nearly at their final temperature. For a comparison, Hadley Rille is on the minus 20 degree centigrade at 1.5 meters depth, to refresh your memory was minus 16 at 2.3. Both probes show an increase of temperature with depth and it is clear that we will get a valid Heat-Flow measurement. The LEAM is functioning properly responding to calibration and sensors show a low noise figure. The LEAM will be off until lunar afternoon and on with sensors covered until after sunset. Otto Berg asked that you accept his thanks and appreciation. On the LSG, the sensor beam cannot be nulled at this time in spite of Jack's efforts. We are still studying the problem and hope to find a workaround. In any case, the instrument does function to some extent as a vertical seismometer and may be useful in a search for a gravitational radiation from pulsars. The LSPE is fully operational LMS and clearly recorded on all four geophones and apparent seismic velocity measured across the geophone array was 110 meters per second. Regolith velocity was very close to that measure at the Apollo 16 site. The LM impact was clearly recorded on the geophones and the estimated distance was 10 kilometers away in the South Massif, actually very close to the targeted point. Although I guess you've discussed this; we'didn't see it on the video. The first charge went off while you were on the backside last REV and it s very apparent on the traces which I'm monitoring right now. I think the next one's due sometime within the next 2 hours. Okay, the lunar mass spectrometer - the low voltage circuits of the LMS have been operated briefly. All monitors indicate the proper performance of the instu-ments but application of high voltages will await lunar sunset when both the analyzer and the site have had time to outgas. The temperature of the radiator plate is slightly above normal but not so high to be even important. That was from Dick Hodges. Okay, here's a little summary from Dave Strangway on the SEP. He starts out by saying,1i water, water everywhere and plenty to be found because you didn't get behind the timeline. The SEP transmitter was confirmed to be working well at the correct power level using the lunar sounder. The receiver heated well above predictions during the whole mission as I'm sure you are aware, but the two prime data legs were operated within the temperature limits of the recorder and we have no reason to doubt that we got good data. There is also a good chance that leg from station 4 to the LM was within the temperature limits. Your procedures were performed excellently and we look forward to processing the DSEA tape. Okay, now to - let's see, we got the TGE which is considered a spectacular success. The Earth-Moon gravity transfer indicates a value of - we'll read the numbers in milligauss - at the Taurus-Littrow base -but the value will be used to obtain a revised value for the lunar radius at this landing site. Gravity measurement made during the three EVAs showed a large negative anomaly of about minus 38 milligauss at the base of the South Massif and a similar negative anomaly of about a minus 30 at the base of the North Massif. Preliminary conclusions of the traverse gravimeter mea - the TGE measurements indicate that the material under the valley floor of Taurus-Littrow is much denser than that of the North and South Massif. Gravity values will support the hypothesis that the valley subfloor consists of dense basaltic rock perhaps as much as three or four kilometers thickness. The extra measurements between station 2 and 3 will be of great help in determining the nature of the boundaries of this basaltic layer and the varied extension of the massif. The cosmic ray detector, actually you know as much as we'do about the data return from it, of course, but the - we'did recover it early in EVA-3 as you remember, and that was due to minor increase in low energy solar protons and heavier particles - we checked it here - and the reduced exposure will not offset the scientific results. The neutron probe was exposed to tge surface for 49 hours. PI estimates that the distance from the RTG to the probe is 40 meters which will mean that the background count will be low and he thanks you kindly for those few extra steps.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 124:28 CST 19:21 MC840/1
124:28:00|CAPCOM|And the last one was to be summarized was the field geology and they asked for a very short summary, so Waltberger came through with 3 typewritten pages. So, we're just going to skip the whole thing, except the last line, which was to say that you guys did an outstanding job. Over.
|AMERICA|Thank you, Gordy. We're just pleased that so many things are working well, and happy that the Pi's are satisfied. That was our objective and we came up here to meet it, and those things that are done, I hope we met it well, and we've got a few more things to do yet.
|CAPCOM|Well, I can assure you you're not the only . ones that are pleased.
|AMERICA|Gordy, you know it's satisfying to have put that much time in and come out with some meaningful results. That makes us all feel good. Have you been able, or did you see that first charge on the video.
|CAPCOM|I forgot to mention that. No. We sure didn't see a thing. We had the camera aimed over there, but it was almost a kilometer away. That was a one pound charge and we played it back several times, but nobody saw a hint of anything.
|AMERICA|Okay. If you guys you got a few more going off here in short order don't you.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. I don't think we're up to the next one yet, but we'll keep you posted on whether we see anything, or how they're doing.
|AMERICA|I might also say, we appreciate the time and effort the Pi's put in with their experiments and with us also .
|CAPCOM|Okay. I'll make sure that gets to the back room.
|AMERICA|Gordy, this is Jack. What did they see over next to the Sculptured Hills on the gravimeter?
|CAPCOM|Well let's see, Jack. They kind of - let me turn back here. They actually reported when they mentioned the negative anomaly of minus 30 milligals at the base of the North Massif. They said Stations 6 and 8 parenthetically there so evidently they're including the whole area there as the negative anomaly. I'll try get a more amplified answer to yo ur question.
|AMERICA|Now, could you see if you can verify with them that they were unable to or there was no distinction between the measurements in the Sculptured Hills and the North Massif.
|CAPCOM|Yes. I'll work on that.
|AMERICA|Or better yet, what was the distinction between the Sculptured Hills and the subfloor area?
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 214:28 CST 19:21 MC840/2
214:28:00|CAPCOM|You may have to wait til next time around for your answer.
|AMERICA|Oh, there's no hurry. You can wait til tomorrow or even a week if you want to. I was just thinking about that problem.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|By the way, Gordy, you might tell Bob Walker, if he's around , that the cosmic ray as far as I know was untouched by human hand at least on the Moon. And it looked very, very clean when I put it back together.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack. We'll pass that along.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. One more question from the surgeon on this mysterious trace on the LMP's biomed. Do you have anything plugged in to the, is the biomed still plugged in and laying over on Jack's umbilical or is there, is there anything plugged in to, to Jack's that could explain the funny trace here. It's kind of a sporatic looking, looks like somebody with a heart in a pretty bad shape. Over.
|AMERICA|Gordy, my heart has always been in bad shape for other reasons than the one the surgeon's thinking about. It turns out that I am still plugged together. I just don't have the sensors on. I will remedy that situation, so he doesn't have to worry anymore.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that solves the mystery. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|Say, America. About 30 seconds to LOS. See you next time.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordy. Thank you very much and we'll see you coming around.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 214 hours 36 min utes and we've had loss of signal now with America on the 64th revolution of the Moon. Be reacquiring in a little less than 45 minutes. And coming up at about 215 hours 27 minutes, a little less than 1 hour from now, we're scheduled to have the second detonation of an explosive charge on the lunar surface as part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment. This charge will be a one-half pound charge located about six tenths of a kilometer from the Lunar Roving Vehicle. The summary of science information read up to the crew by our CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton will be available in the News Center. We hope to get copies of the information read up to the crew to the News Center and reproduced and available. It will of course also be available on the transcript somewhat later. At 214 hours 37 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 19:50 CST 214:56 GET 841/1
214:56:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 214 hours 56 minutes. In about one minute we'll be commanding the television on the lunar roving vehicle ON and we'll have it positioned to look for this second explosive charge which is going to be fired at about 215 hours and 27 minutes. This charge is part of the lunar seismic profiling experiment. It is a one-half pound charge of explosives located about six-tenths of a kilometer southeast of the lunar roving vehicle. And we've got black and white TV now from lunar surface and we'll have that through the converter and up on the area where that charge is located. And the instrumentation communications engineer will be putting that camera in the proper position.
|PAO|We're about 27 minutes away from the predicted time of detonation. However, we are within the window during which the charge could explode. As we mentioned on the previous charge, this window is brought about by the fact that the timer is a mechanical timer, the firing charges set continuously during the window and as the timer moves across the face of the firing pin, the firing charge going in - the firing command going in continuously fires the charge as the window moves across the pin.
|PAO|And we believe the television camera is now centered on the area where this charge is located. Hopefully the charge is right in the middle of the television s creen.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 20:10 CST 215:16 GET 842/1
215:16:00|PAO|Tbis is Apollo Control now about 1 minute 20 seconds away from reacquiring Apollo 17. It will be on the 65th revolution and we're looking through the lunar rover television camera at the spot on the Moon where we believe the second of two seismic charges to be detonated, is located. we'do have a problem with the TV camera in that it appears to be heating up close to the acceptable limit and it could become necessary to shut the camera down prior to the time we have the detonation. This decision will be based in part on what sort of priorities the scientists have for other things they would like to view with the camera in relation to the detonation of this charge. And the instrumentation communications engineer is keeping a close eye on those temperature readings reports that the temperature has apparently begun to stablize and to maybe even move down a bit, so we maybe out of the woods on that score,
|PAO|And we have acquisition of signal. Should get a good stable lock on shortly which will decrease the noise on the air-to-ground circuit.
|AMERICA|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Hello, America. Here at Houston.
|AMERICA|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, America, a lot clearer.
|AMERICA|Okay, Houston, America here. The mapper when we took the image motion from OFF to OFF and then the mapping camera switch from OFF to ON-OFF-ON I think. Maybe it was stamped by a 0, but anyhow, as soon as we went to ON the barber pole on the (garbled) back, went back to standby at just before AOS or just about AOS there, it (garbled) 20 about 15 20. Then we got a gray on the talkback with the mapping camera standby, then we went back to the cycling and it worked okay, so it's working now and it's ON. What a thing. It didn't start working until about 20.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we got that.
|AMERICA|Must have been to cold, huh?
|CAPCOM|We'll look at it now.
|CAPCOM|America, would you select wide on the high gain and then narrow?
|AMERICA|Don't seem to make any difference. I'll try a react position again manual. And wide.
|AMERICA|AUTO narrow doesn't seem to be working very good.
|CAPCOM|Let's try react, Ron. You're in a skim reflection zone there is probably the problem.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 20:19 GET 215:25 MC843/1
215:25:00|PAO|And, we just had a call from our Instrumentation Communications Engineer that he saw the charge blow down in the lower left corner of the television screen, and simultaneous with that, we're getting very active response from the seismic experiment, the tracing pens are very -- very active, almost going wild at this point.
|PAO|And, the scientists in the back room here also confirm having seen the charge explode. We'll be re-rolling -- rewinding the tapes and playing back the video tape of the detonation.
|SC|Gordie, this is the LMP. How do you read?
|CAPCOM|Jack, you're loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, add to that little discussion of the pool-bottomed cone-shaped craters that I had, I think, the last rev, that the one place there seems to be some variety in the freshness of those kinds of craters is in Mare Smythii where -- the ejecta blanket of many of those kind of craters has some small dark halo craters on them — have small dark halo craters on them. Three or four or half a dozen per crater, on occasion. But, that seems to be something that we -- I've only seen, so far, in the Mare Smythii region.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|They're superimposed on the bright ray or ejecta blanket and are ejecta blanket systems of the -those fresh cone craters.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/.15/72 GET 215:29 CST 20:23 MC844/1
215:29:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I got some words for you to request for a little visual observation at the landing site area, having to do with orange material. If you're ready for about a 5 minute briefing, I'd like to give it to you so you can get set up.
|AMERICA|Okay, go ahead, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, what we want to do is see if, this was triggered off by your observation of orange material last REV I guess, and possibly earlier. But the idea here is to look for some craters that we've identified on photographs that are in similar geologic setting to Shorty Crater and see if we can see orange material around them. We're trying to determine if the orange material at Shorty was a one time special occasion or whether possibly its common to the area and just never been noticed before. We think you'll be able to determine this visually, better than any other way. So, if you can get out the orbit, the orbit charts, the orbit photographs, let's see, the lunar landmark maps for the CSM and turn to the landing site number 2 of 4 picture. Let me know when you've got that, and I'll show you where we think a likely point is to see craters that are similar setting to Shorty, to look for orange material.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordy, we'll do that. I made a couple passes with the binoculars over the Dark Mantle around Littrow already, and have seen nothing comparable with what's around Sovicius, but let's have the examples, and we'll make a special effort on it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, have you got the site photo number 204?
|AMERICA|Stand by just 1.
|AMERICA|Which one is that, Gordo, 2 of 4.
|CAPCOM|No. Number two of 4 of the site photos.
|AMERICA|Oh, 2 of 4, okay. Okay, we got her.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you can see the landing site there at about 4 o'clock, and the 7 kilometer crater in the, on the center line of the page, about a third of the way down from the top, the large bright crater there is Littrow B is the name of it.
|AMERICA|Got it.
|CAPCOM|And on the southern half of the ejecta blanket from that crater, there're several dark halo craters, which we think are in similar structure as Shorty. We think that would be a likely spot to look for orange material. There's a, Farouk has circled about 4 or 5, they show up say at 4 o'clock 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, and 9 o'clock out about, from the center about a crater diameter, in other words, a crater radius, beyond the left, roughly. We suggest that you utilize the best window in your attitude which you should be maneuvering to now If you if I haven't completely interrupted the Flight Plan. Is, at that attitude window, let's see, 1 is the best and 4 should i
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 215:29 CST 20:23 MC844/2
215:29:00|CAPCOM|point up that way also. We suggest you get somebody on the binoculars at 1 and use the same camera setup with the exception of using the 250 millimeter lens, if you can, that you're going to be setting up for as per the Flight Plan for the orbital science photos. If you can put the 250 on there, use KK as shown, and F8 1 250 as an infinity I'll repeat that when you get to it. For the pictures if you see anything. What we're looking for is orange material.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordy. We're working on that now, and we'll get KK out.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We were thinking you might be able to get the guy on the camera in window 4 and the binoculars in window 1.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're about ready to replay now the video tape showing that second seismic charge detonating. You'll see it down in the lower left corner of the screen. It'll appear as a bright flash, with little or no dust visible.
|AMERICA|I think maybe you're right about window 4 possibly being the photography window. If I can get oriented right. I thought you, oh. There you go. Yes. It's all set right here. And, Gordy, I'm going to try to also shoot if you'll let me 2 pictures on KK of that depression, colorful depression we saw near Sovicius Galois, if I can see it. Is that okay?
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll give you a unilateral GO on those two frames and we suggest upu use 2 or 3 frames on this area we've been talking about also, in addition to the scheduled 28.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|If we get short of film or something Farouk says the last part of this orbital science photos after you get to the end of the run change to 125th of a second, it's kind of marginal for photography anyway.
|AMERICA|Right. Okay, Gordy, you want the pictures whether we think we see orange or not, huh?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|AMERICA|That's very strange. May have to pass you the camera in a hurry, Gene. I'd love to. do that. You know, Gordy, the craters we're seeing around Sovicius that are orange or gray, orangish are very clearly orange, orangish gray and the whole, or at least most of the crater is that way. We looked at Shorty today and Ron said that even the little bit of orange that he saw the other day is now visible. And I have to agree with that. The amount of orange we saw on the surface certainly would not be comparable to what we re seeing around Sovicius Galois.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 215:29 CST 20:23 MC844/3
215:29:00|AMERICA|And in a couple of quick scans of previous REVS of the area, the Dark Mantle, near Littrow, I could not, I did not notice any obvious orange gray craters.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 20:32 GET 215:39 845/1
215:39:00|CAPCOM|Just to make - to be sure we're clear on this. We suggest that area to look for them only as a likely spot. But any evidence of craters with orange material in the whole dark mantle area around Littrow and the edge of Tranquility there is worth noting and getting a picture of i f you see it.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|I don't thing there's anything there. Yes, I've got a few. Yes. Okay, 5.6 and a 250. No, I don't either. I don't see anything comparable at all. You know the ones that we've been seeing the - definite orange and the light tan stuff around are pure light ejecta blankets around them not dark.
|SC|Houston, I guess none of us see anything comparable to what is down by Scopicious. And no obvious color either.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Well, their comparable to Shorty but their not comparaable to the ones that we've been seeing the obvious orange.
|SC|The craters are comparable to Shorty as Ron points out, but the color is not there.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'd like to give you a couple space craft chores like to terminate the charge on battery B and turn H2 tank 1 fans on.
|SC|Hand me the camera. H2 tank 1 fans going on and I'll get that charge in just a second.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and just a reminder to go back to f-4 at 250th when you get ready for the orbital science photos also the 80 millimeter lens if you happen to be (garbled) 250 on there.
|SC|We're getting a litter closer to the terminate change to 5.6, Jack. Oh, maybe not -

|SC|Better I change to f.4.
|SC|Yeah, but you're going to look at the nadir, aren't you?
|SC|Yeah, that's right.
|SC|You sure we let the -- yeah, that's right, 8 second interferometer or for looking at the nadir with the 80-millimeter, right?1.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|Okay. Let me take a look down at the - that Mare floor and Dawes, no, that's — that's not Dawes, that's Bessel.
|SC|Doesn't look like Dawes' dust. It's got a bunch of little depressions; they look like rimless pits in the bottom of it.
|SC|Bessel doesn't have any of those. It looks like a bunch of debris.
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|Yep, yep, I see it.
|SC|Yours is -- I see yours, Gene. It's on up there a little further, but all of these are in the -this is not out on the Mare floor of Serenitatis. It's on the hills there Haenus Mountains. It's just to the west of the Sulpicius Galois Rille, and it's elongate feature that runs kind of north northwest by south southeast. Yeah. No, it's not from hard core at all. It's up there in the edge of the Haenus Mountains. But, that was the same type of material -- it has the same color difference as the material around the Tacquet Rilles back there. Yeah, see . all those bright orange craters right in the -- in the Sulpicius Galois Rille, up at the north end of it? Jack calls them an orangeish-grey, I call them an orangeish-tan. No. No. Jack, did you get the pictures — good picture --s because I can take it. See that one, oh yeah, see that one on the Mare?
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|There's my orange crater. I knew (garble).
|SC|Yeah, that's It. Yeah, I can, too.
|SC|Yeah, Gene, your's Is out of the -- I got a picture of it,
|SC|Are you sure?
|SC|Yeah, yeah, I know. It's got a -
|SC|It's just inside (garble).
|SC|Just in the — wait a minute. Okay, 1'vc got one out in the Mare Itself that's got a strep --

|SC|Yeah, when we get to — when I see one out there, I'll get it.
|SC|Yeah, I better have becausewe're getting close to — as a matter of fact, I need it just about now.
|SC|El Gordo, we're going — we're going to get set up around orbital science, but that little classic crater — I could see it again with the —
|SC|With the 250?
|SC|— with the naked eye. I don't think it's the same one that Ron and Jack were talking about, but this is so classic; it's just out of the Mare into the foothills to the — right along our orbital track.
|SC|And, we're starting with Mag 109 for the orbital science on kilo kilo, and I don't know what the number was before we started taking all our (laughter).
|CAPCOM|(Garble) we copy that 109 on a k -- on kk.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|What? Okay, there's the old Apennines. Where we heading for on this, Gordie? Can you give me a clue, as we go along? Well, yeah, Mare Imbrium is a big thing. Oh, the stupid thing doesn't work. I got that one. I got that one.
|SC|Ah, I think you're kidding.
|SC|Yeah, I did.
|SC|Gordie.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|This is Jack. My impression in that rimless V-shaped depression that had the striking talus on it that it also was a spotted, mottled rim area that has the orangeish-tan, or orangeish-grey color as the spot* And,it looked as if the in the first — in this pass — and, I'll try to verify it if we have another opportunity. It looked as if the more red-grey, red-brown-grey, if you will, material was lower in the section within the walls of the depression. This is a very steep-walled depression, by the way. It has talus streaming down the sides of it, and the coloration streams in the same direction. It looks as if there may be layers, or roughly, horizontal zones that are -that have the colorations that we're seeing, which are forming the talus slopes down below there.
|SC|Very quick — the window I changed to2.8.
|CAPCOM|Okay, not till you get on up the line, Ron, to Lambert.
|SC|Oh, okay.
|SC|Lambert? Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ad , your pictures are pretty much right along the nadir.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 215:58 CST 2051 MC-847/1
215:58:00|SC|There, I got it okay, there's La Hire Rille coming up. Lambert's right over therecoming up just to the south of - what is that? Maybe we can start with the LaHire rilles. There's one rille goes right through it almost, and another one -see, goes northeast southwest. Oh, I see, okay. Gordy, getting a good oblique view of Copernicus on this trip and some of the dark haloes craters that we mapped originally on the north portion of the ejecta blanket which were similar to Copernicus. H are very clearly darker haloed than the -or have darker blankets around them than ejecta blanket from Copernicus.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and Ron should be due to change to 2.8 about now.
|SC|And, this is a good view of the central peaks although from some distance, and, as Ron and I were discussing earlier, it's not at all clear that that in fact that dike does not come through as the - the so-called dike -as the - as the unit that is clearly defined. Yeah, I was looking at it through the binocs last time and I couldn't see anything that was really defined as coming on through there.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|There's still a very clear distinction between the dark floor material of Copernicus and the hummocky floor material - the dark smooth being in the northwest quadrant. You know, if Lambert is an impact crater, it's sure awful smooth ejecta around that thing. It only goes out about a half a crater in diameter, maybe a crater in diameter at some spots, at the most. But It's not rough. It's blocky looking, you know it's smooth - smooth undulating.
|CAPCOM|Ron, your next camera change is at Euler which you change to 125th of a second.
|SC|I think we just clicked. we'did. You out of film? Yep. Want that other mag? Let's put oscar oscar in there and see if it will work. Here. Okay. Where's oscar oscar. We got a big oblique view of the Hortensius dome and with her nice little central pit craters. Did we hit the stick or somethig? Looks like a change in attitude, well, I'll be darned put oscar-oscar on there and I got but one picture. Yeah, it's empty. Yeah, that's probably right. It won't come out too good there, anyhow. To close to the terminator for this kind of film.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we agree with that, Ron. Farouk was mentioning that was kind of - beyond Euler was pretty marginal anyway.
|SC|Yeah. Gordo, that classic crater that I talked about last rev, I picked it up again this rev with the naked eye and I also looked at it with the binox. If Ron was talking about the same crater, and I have my doubts, he got a picture of it he said. But, the interior - I won't say there's a change of blanket, it's just dark. I'd say it's probably about the size, putting it in the right perspective, of Shorty, or just a little bit bigger. The inside is dark. By that, I don't mean it's black or anything inside - I just can't really see inside of it - but the - it's a rust colored blanket that comes out and overlaps on the rims and then has the classic ejecta, and I'm going to take a shot at trying to get a picture of it next rev or sometime when we re in attitude cause it* s too good to miss.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 215:58 CST 2051 MC847/2

|SC|Here's November November, it may have 3 or 4 pictures left. It's on 160. Messed that one up.
|SC|We've got Papa Papa for opportunity.
|SC|Y e ah .
|SC|Houston, you ready for laser altimeter ON?
|CAPCOM|Standby. America we're seeing some higher than normal temperatures on fuel cell One. We'd like you to go to panel 226 and check the fuel cell One pump circuit breaker and also the switch on panel 5. Over.
|SC|Well, don't ask me how it happened, but your switch on panel 5 isOFF. Going to AC-1.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I guess that's the best news we could have had on that. And we're ready for the laser altimeter, and get the attitude.
|SC|Okay, and A, Gordy - Gordy?
|SC|Here's one you can explain to me. When I turned that ON, well, I guess that - I got a sudden drop in H2 flow and then it went up overshot a little and now it's steady. I suspect that's what you're E Com friend there will say should happen.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's great and we see indications that the pump started up.
|SC|Okay, that was a good call. I can't - how long have you noticed that, Gordy? Do you know?
|CAPCOM|Well, it's been about 3 minutes, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I guess I'm to blame then, don't know how it happened.
|SC|Hey, Houston, America. Do we have any more orbital science photos?
|CAPCOM|Standby.
|SC|I think that was it, but I'm not sure.
|SC|Okay, Houston. Laser altimeter is ON and image motion is barber pole plus 4.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Thank you.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 216 hours 15 minutes. A few minutes ago you heard Capcom Gordon Fullerton query the crew as to whether or not a switch might have been placed in the wrong position on one of the pumps circulating glycol, a coolant, to fuel cell No. 1. And Jack Schmitt looked at the panel, confirmed that a switch was in fact in the OFF position, turned it back on and everthing was back to normal with no problem. By way of background the E Com, John Aaron, had noticed a slight increase in temperature on fuel cell One via the telemetry* After watching it for or 4 minutes he asked Capcom to check with the crew, see if the switch controlling the glycol pump was in the OFF position and as mentioned, Jack Schmitt confirmed that it was. This pump, as we say, circulates liquid glycol coolant through the fuel cells and cools it in much the same way  that water flowing through radiators and around the engine of your automobile, cools the automobile engine. The most likely explanation for the switch being in the wrong position that we have here, appeared to be a more or less transitory phenomenon, was that it was dumped by one of the crewmen moving about the cabin in zero g. The fuel cell temperatures very quickly had dropped back to normal once the pump was turned on again. We have about 18 minutes remaining in this pass before we loose radio contact with Apollo 17. We are showing an orbit at this time with a high point or apocynthion of 65.2 nautical miles and a low point or para— cynthion of 62 .2  Among the other statistics the orbital rate of the CSM at this time is 36 477 pounds. And the orbital period just a tad under 2 hours, 1 hour 59 minutes 17 seconds.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 216:18 CST 21:11 MC849/1
216:18:00|CAPCOM|Say Ron, this is Houston. And there's no more scheduled orbital science photos. We can't seem to run down Farouk to see if he has anything up his sleeves. There are a couple passes with black and white coming up, one next REV, and then a couple just prior to TEI.
|AMERICA|Okay, looks like what we got left here, as far as I can tell anyhow, just, we've got all of magazine Papa, Papa, and maybe 4 or 5 of them on November, November.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we'll come back to you if there's anything we got in mind to schedule on on either of those.
|AMERICA|Okay, we want to save some for after TEI, too. Shooting back at the Moon.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordy, that's TEI 1 not TEI 2 he's talking about. Okay, I see what he said.
|CAPCOM|Rog. TEI period.
|AMERICA|That's right.
|AMERICA|These guys can call it what they like, but I know what it's going to be and when.
|CAPCOM|America, a little human interest stuff here. We just watched the second charge go off, not just watched, it's been about half hour ago or so. Second charge went off and we caught it just in the lower left corner of the TV view. It looked like a, to me it looked like a flashbulb went off, flashbulb laying on the ground went off, just a kind of a quick flash. No big shower of dirt or anything that I could tell.
|AMERICA|How far away do you expect that one was Gordy?
|CAPCOM|That one was 600 meters away. And it was a half pound charge.
|AMERICA|Yes you're still pretty far away over that. Yes you're still pretty far away over that terrain that those things are sitting in over there. You're going to probably see something when you look at those that spiked by the end of the SEP and back to the east there.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|AMERICA|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|AMERICA|Do you need the cryo stirred at all today?
|CAPCOM|Let me see here. Stand by. No. I guess you've been bouncing around there enough. we'don't need to stir them.
|AMERICA|It won't hurt them will it?
|CAPCOM|No.

|SC|See you Gordie, and thanks for keeping an eye on us.
|CAPCOM|One last frank reminder to continue the DSE per the flight plan after LOS.
|SC|Okay, we got it.
|PAO|And, we've had loss of signal with Apollo 17 on this the 65th revolution. We'll be reacquiring as usual in about 45 minutes. And for the rest of the flight plan up to the crews sleep period which begins at about 220 hours we have relatively quiet time very little scheduled in the flight plan - have an eat period. During the next revolution the crew will be operating the panoramic camera in the SIM bay. They're scheduled to be in the midst of an exercise period at this time. And we could confirm from the biomedical data on Ron Evans his heart rate that he was indeed exercising. Prior to beginning the sleep period the crew will be going through their film magazines getting everything ready for an active day of picture taking tomorrow. There will be a lunar surface science briefing at 9:20 a.m. Saturday December 16 in the main auditorium building 1 at MSC. Again that time is 9:20 a.m. December 16. At 216 hours 37 minutes this is Apollo control Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 217:18 CST 22:11 MC851/1
217:18:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 217 hours 18 minutes, and we'll be back in radio contact with Apollo 17 in about a minute. On this revolution, the major activities aboard the spacecraft will be the operation of scientific instruments. It's a relatively quiet period of time for the crew. The pan camera will be turned on briefly, just so we can get a look at the telemetry data on that camera. We won't be obtaining any photography with it. The mapping camera will be on for one full revolution obtaining ground track coverage supplemented by the laser altimeter data that provides an altitude reference in each photograph. Also the infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers will be operating and the crew will be taking a few hand held photographs out the spacecraft windows, using the Hasselblad camera. We may have a bit of noisy communications toward the beginning of this pass. We've just gotten acquisition of signal and we'll be receiving the spacecraft through one of the 85 foot dish antennas, rather than the 210 antenna. we'do have acquisition of signal now and appear to have reasonably good signal strength.
|AMERICA|Houston, America. Looks like we're with you again.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|(garbled) we've been taking these pictures just as we came up.
|CAPCOM|Rog. You're loud and clear.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I have three one-liners for the Flight Plan.
|AMERICA|Is this the same Flight Plan we've been working on up here?
|CAPCOM|I think it is.
|AMERICA|Okay, Gordy. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 218:09, delete mapping camera retract; at 218:30, delete mapping camera laser altimeter cover CLOSED and at 219:59 next page, in addition to IR and UV covers OPEN, put in laser altimeter ON.
|AMERICA|Okay, at 219, mapping camera laser alti meter OPEN, and at 218:09, delete.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that second one was deleting a cover CLOSED, but I'm sure that's the one you got. Mapping camera laser altimeter cover CLOSED. And that laser altimeter, we'll just leave her run through the sleep period.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|May have. Smith may have on the thing. I still want to talk a little bit about these polygonal craters and Smythii. The one right above REV 62 picture on the thing, there's definitely kind of a, an unindated old depression there with mare, very smooth mare floor on the thing. With two,
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 GET 217:18 CST 22:11 MC851/2
217:18:00|AMERICA|two old craters. And that is definitely a younger flow than whatever made the polygonal crater-like depression. Right above the REV 62 number. The thing that bothers me about that is that they, they almost oh, looks like if you threw a rock in the mud, you know, to make a mud pie, and you get a wave or a ripple going out from there. In other words, you've got a high wave front going out from a circular direction with a slightly sloping up to that wave front. That's on the inner ring on the thing; the outer ring, of course, is a typical type ring that you get from an impact type of an operation. It looked like the rough looking floors of those rings, ring basins, essentially have the same albedo, the same characteristic as the rougher looking floor in the Mare Smythii itself.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 22:23 CST 217:30 GET 852/1
217:30:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|CAPCOM|We'll take high gain to AUTO.
|SC|Okay, you have it.
|SC|And I took a picture of that one in Smythii is frame 160 on mag November November, and the reason I took the picture is really because on the western edge of the big basin looks like there's a small impact crater, but it's only been dished out in the more recent flat dark gray mare material. And looks like when it comes to the edge of the original basin ring, that part is not ejected out at all. So essentially you have a cone type depression with an impact crater. The materials only been excavated in the - in the newer mare material.
|CAPCOM|Okay, understand that. Say again where that one is.
|SC|Yeah, that's the one above rev 62 directly north of the Wright Brothers in the 12:00 position from the Wright Brothers.
|CAPCOM|Oh, okay.
|SC|You know, Houston, we're just passing over a little polygonal crater that's maybe 15 kilometers in diameter - 15 or 20 kilometers in diameter. It maybe 10 to 15 and down in the basis of it is kind of a polygonal fill. It again has that dark greenish black rock that is collected down at the bottom of it and you also see it creeping down the side of it. But I think one of the most significant features about the crater itself is that it has a swirl and these are honest to goodness, they look like swirls rather than rays. It has a swirl pattern around there. It's radial from that most recent impact.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|CAPCOM|Back in Houston, we haven't got data right at the moment cause we are in a skin reflection zone. We'd like you to hold the pan camera to standby until we call you.
|SC|Thank you.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|It's near Xerxes. Come down from Xerxes. Xerxes is the subdued crater up there. Come down from Xerxes. There's a little one about 10 kilometers in diameter and then a big one that's about 50 and then there's a bright one. Okay, and then -
|SC|(garbled) crater.
|SC|Yeah. Then right, let me see kinda north west of that bright one, about a crater and a half diameter from it it an orange ringed crater again.
|SC|See it - right, right, just a - bright one just about a crater and a half diameter from the bright one. See it. It's an orange ring on it. That's the one we were talking about. I'll get it. Yeah.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 22:23 CST 217:30 GET 852/2
217:30:00|SC|(garbled)
|SC|No. No. That's right. It's not as bright, but it's another example of an orangish tanish. See what? See that bright crater down there. Just about a crater and a half diameter to the north of it. Maybe 250, I don't know. And Houston, that, was frame 162.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|SC|Ye ah, we-.
|SC|And just before that I took one of a ridge just on the southern edge of Crissium on a - the pattern of the Massifs in that area were very impressive but two frames just before that.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Ah, Houston, just one other question. I was looking around here at myself and I got mag Victor Victor which is the HBW for the Nikon, and looking at the flight plan it doesn't look like we're going to be able to use that any time. I just wonder if we might be able to use it for some of these terminator photos.
|CAPCOM|We'll check on the film. We'd like you to go wide for 10 seconds and then back to narrow.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|There's wide. Looks like that did it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, the high gain looks good and on the film it's your option on that magazine and there's no scheduled usage.
|SC|Oh, okay, thank you.
|SC|Okay, you want pan camera power ON now.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. We're ready now.
|SC|Okay, it's on.
|SC|What?
|SC|You want to get it or I'll get it?
|CAPCOM|Okay, America we'll take pan camera power OFF now.
|SC|Okay, it's OFF.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 22:36 GET 217:44 853/1
217:44:00|SC|The last time I was up in the air all the time on this SIM bay stuff.
|SC|Houston, areas in the landing site where we now know there are extensive blocks of the subfloor material particularly in the walls of the larger craters. I have the Impression that those block fields from this altitude give a light bluish gray appearance.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|I don't know if I would extrapolate that in other craters, but we might start trying a little bit.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Following that a little bit farther looking into Dawes the lower talus slopes of Dawes have about the same hue and are overlaying the first by a zone that1s producing - or several ledges that seem to be producing white talus and above that is the - or make that very light gray talus and above that is a tan gray talus slope that carries right up to the rim of Dawes. So there are three distinct major stratigraphic units showing up in the talus slope in Dawes that I can see. Jack, can you see any holes in the -square holes in the floor of Dawes there?
|SC|No wait a minute now, I guess I was talking about the crater northeast of Dawes - let me check Dawes with the same sequence.
|SC|No, Dawes is the little one down there. That other one is - -
|SC|No, I take it back again that was Dawes I was talking about.
|SC|You were using the binocs? Yes, I talked about Dawes already with — ~ No those aren't holes down there, those are just great big - great big blocks that have fallen off the side of the mountain. Okay, between the tan gray and the very light gray there may be another thin and possibly intermittant zone of a - just a plain apparently gray unit forming in the talus slope.
|SC|And in the crater to the southeast - southwes t excuse me of Dawes large crater I'll get the name in a minute. You see the lower blueish gray units and the next white unit or light gray unit up, but the brown gray unit is not nearly so evident at the top. In fact, I didn't really say I and recognize it there at all. I'll have to check that one, though, put a query by it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|That's Bessel your talking about. The top of Serenity?
|SC|No, no the one back.
|SC|Oh Plinius.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/15/72 CST 22:36 GET 217:44 MC853/2
217:44:00|SC|Plinius?
|SC|Plinius is that rough looking one. Yes.
|SC|Yes, that was Plinius I was talking about.
|SC|Oh yes, yes the oranges, yes.
|SC|And the next large - well, it's not large not as big as Dawes. It's a reasonable size crater that to the west the talus is largely just white debris on the slope of it. But, it doesn't look like it penetrated nearly as deep as the other two we talked about.
|SC|Ah, Menalaus? Takay is the one that is out - right underneath us right now. And then Menelaus is right on the edge of the Serenitatis basin before you get to the Haemus Mountains.
|SC|Okay, looking at Menelaus you can see where the edge of Serenitatis goes through the crater. And, the north wall is quite distinctly to grayer let's say blueish gray than the south wall which is light - very light gray in the talus. My guess Is that it's a very nearly vertical contact at that point.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|3 saps away the talus is suggested, but talus does move vertically. Looking at the depression with all the color streaking in the talus on the walls, there I'll say again, that the more red looking unit or talus is coining from below the orangish gray material but it is not a continuous horizon at least not so far as the talus indicates. It's local spots that are giving the reddish color.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordie, that particular impression doesn't look like it's an impact generated depression at all.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|We'll sure have to look and see if those things still look orange tomorrow, because yesterday Stoney looked kinda orange there on the northeast rim, but it sure doesn't today - Shorty, yeah. Dave's gonna learn the names of all those craters you guys named down there.
|SC|Oh yeah, I know, quite a bunch of them.
|SC|Hey, (gable) like them.
|SC|Decalldaire is what I call it.
|SC|Yeah, Ron Decalldaire - Im just correlating apparent colors now and hues and the lighter colored material there is comparable in hue to the subfloor color at the landing site.

|CAPCOM|Are you shooting pretty much straight down or out of front on this one?
|SC|Let's see. Pretty much straight down on this one.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I've1got a realtime plot of your longi -- yeah,longitude here, so I can call right on longitude. 0h, okay. Yeah, I started before Tobias Mare .
|SC|There goes - what's that? Oh, Aristarchus, okav? About right in here —. good place' .. S? Okay, Houston, back to talking about colors a little bit. It looked as if Lower Talus is more - -
|CAPCOM|Hold one, Jack. It's about time for F 11 Ro n .
|AMERICA|Okay, F 11 at 500.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Euler is lower is blue-gray and the upper is a very light gray from the talus slope up to the rim. Houston I can just start to see the peaks more exposed in the central ' peak - the talus is exposed in the sunlight and it looks like there s massive quantities of large boulders on the peaks. Roger, Gene. Okay, it must be about time for F 8 and l/250th.
|AMERICA|Okay, there's a 250th, okay? Gonna1my littie see. Crater chain down there. Like a cylindrical-con, chain Like between Tobias Mare and Euler1'
|CAPCOM|Roger. Okay,1try F 56 at l/25th.
|SC|56 at l/25th1Is this the last(garb1e)?
|CAPCOM|Last setting,1right, and you should finish up there Tobias1Mare W.

|CAPCOM|Stand by. Okay, we show 66 of evap out temp .
|AMERICA|That's exactly what it jumped to. Okay.
|AMERICA|Gordo, I'm interested. How have you been reading me most all day today? I've been on lightweight headset, all the time.
|CAPCOM|I'd say you're fine, since I've been on. Let me check the rest of the day.
|AMERICA|No, it would be the same all day. You're - you're as good a data point as any. I haven't really tried to make any effort to talk into the mike or anything, I just been talking around it and if you're satisfied, I'm happy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounded good all day, no cut out or anything. No problem.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|AMERICA|Houston, America. The canister's changed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene.
|AMERICA|I think you can stand by for some small torquing angles on this one. Right within the center of the sextant.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Well, did get five balls that time, but that's not bad.
|CAPCOM|We'll buy that. Well the Z axis here looks pretty good anyway. You're clear to torque.
|AMERICA|(Laughter) Okay. We'll torque at 21, 11missed 30, let's go to 2145.
|CAPCOM|Okay. America, Houston. Request the H2 tank 2 fan ON. Over.
|AMERICA|Okay. H2 tank 2 fan is ON.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and the waste water dump that you'll s tart after LOS, should take 11 minutes, if you want to set your kitchen clock. Also a reminder, this time after LOS we go to REACQ. Over.
|AMERICA|(laughter) Okay. Thank you. Will do. We']] go to REACQ. Houston, the IR UV covers are closed.

|AMERICA|Hello, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Hello, America, Houston, glad to have you back.
|AMERICA|Well, we got a good one for you, Bob, not too good but in the midst of other things we let our waste water go to zero on that dump - as a matter of fact, it went past zero, and the purge is starting to fill up again and the best we can tell on board that it shouldn't disturb anything, but you might take a good look at it.-
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got our (garble) taking a lookatit.
|AMERICA|Okay. How are you doing tonight.
|CAPCOM|Not too badly. I'll have you to know it's clear down here. We saw the Moon for the first time since launch1day. It's getting bright. It looks like you mig be somewhere over the terminator on Imbrium.
|AMERICA|Is that right?
|CAPCOM|First time we've seen the Moon since launch day1,
|AMERICA|Oh, that's beautiful. Your weather has been that bad, huh?1.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm. Fog and drizzle and ram and ram.
|AMERICA|How much older do you feel, Bob? ^
|CAPCOM|About one day. Okay, America, we'd like H2 tank 2 fans off, H-2 tank 2 off.
|AMERICA|They're off.
|CAPCOM|And, America, as you can tell from the flight plan, we aren't expecting too much from you guys this rev and we aren't expecting to send up too much to you guys either. A reminder that we won t be ask ing Gene and Jack for the PRDs tonight but we certainly would like them in the morning. So you might take that into consideration and we'll be sending you a few uplinks there after the flight plan at 220. Both the state vector and the EMP 523. We also have a clock update that we'll send up and it's a .04 seconds, so it's another b iggie. MAERICA1Okay, Bob, we'll make an effort to get those PRDs and we can get one of them probably out too much trouble, but if it's a case of restowing both those suits to get the second one, well, no we re not going to get it until EVA day. I'm sorry, but that s it.
|CAPCOM|We copy that. I guess they re back stored in the L bag.
|AMERICA|Yes sir.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 219:26 CST 0020 MC-857/2
219:26:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll want the onboard readouts there at the bottom of the page just before you go LOS. And I might pass up one little piece of news - very local news here. Concerning us members of the orange team, we're all extremely proud that you and Jack chose to call the soil you found the other night while we were on shift the orange soil. We think it is an obvious honor for the orange team to have been on shift at that point.
|AMERICA|Bob, you know our intent was certainly well meant and we certainly are glad you appreciate it. I detect a certain amount of skepticism whether it's really orange, though.
|CAPCOM|It looked orange on this TV.
|AMERICA|Could you really? Could you see the color and all?
|CAPCOM|Well, so did the blue ocean and the Earth and so did the white suits and everything else, but they looked orange on this TV, anyway.
|AMERICA|Is that on tonight?
|CAPCOM|we'don't have any - no we've seen the two the only two charges for today. we'don't have another charge for, I guess, about another 24 hours or so.
|AMERICA|I think I understand.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Ed is on the orange team, however.
|AMERICA|Bob, I would like a word from you, though, as to whether or not you think there is going to be any problem with that waste water dump to zero. we'don't, after looking at it.
|CAPCOM|No, we aren't expecting any problems. They're looking at it. They're kind of amused but they're looking at it. And Id like to pass up to you fellows -
|AMERICA|(garble) an interesting.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|AMERICA|Alright, nothing, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I might also tell you fellows in case nobody told you yesterday that we tracked the LM on ascent for 30 seconds. Beautiful pitchover and we saw you going away from us after pitch over for 30 seconds. It came out quite well.
|AMERICA|Yes, sir. We heard that, good. I guess I was able to find 102 at .1.
|CAPCOM|In fact, Ed calculates that you were 480 feet 48 zero feet from the lens. As they say, too far is better than too close.
|AMERICA|Well, I was just going to say I cheated a little bit. I made a few stops and backed up a little bit out there.
|CAPCOM|You backed up, huh? That's another first, i sn't it ?
|AMERICA|No, I didn't back up that time, but I did back up.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 219:26 CST 0020 MC-857/3
219:26:00|CAPCOM|We heard that one at station 7 - at 7,1, wasn'tit?
|AMERICA|No, that was somewhere during EVA-2, I can't remember where. Houston, frame numbers 40 through 43 are timed sequences of the waste water dump. As we were in the sunlight.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I copy that one.
|AMERICA|Yeah, Bob, just give us a call when you want the computer.
|CAPCOM|Okay, about another half hour or so, I guess, when we're ready. It will be about 220. And, a reminder we got 220 they were going to go laser altimeter on and the IR and UV covers opened as per your flight plan.
|AMERICA|Yes sir, I got laser on and IR UV open.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're back live now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 219:35 CST 0028 MC 858/1
219:35:00|SC|Hey Bob, while it's sort of quite anything of a news worthy - noteworthy news happen today?
|CAPCOM|Okay, stand by on that. From my recollection this evening, there really wasn't anything, but i'll check. Did you guys get news briefing this morning?
|SC|Yeah, we'did1,
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got some news coming over and we 11 have it here before you go around the horn. Might just while things are quiet also pass up to you that if you run out of the Command Module film there, you do have 2 - you've got some LM surface film left as I'm sure you're aware and 2 mags in particular which look fine are mag Barbara and mag Karen. Barbara has 500 frames of CEX and Karen 100 frames of black and white, excuse me, 50 frames, not 500 of CEX. And 100 of black and white. These mags have never been fit checked on the command module camera but we believe that they will along - as long as we take precaution because the locks don't work the same, on the command module on the LM cameras, Number 1, Number 2 the focus won't be quite as good as on the with the LM cameras,however, it will be satisfactory. So there s 150 frames there you might want to take advantage of in those . mags. We think those are in Romeo 2 stowage - stowage Romeo 2.
|SC|Yeah, yeah, we've already inventoried those. We've got our hands on them. However, we (garbled) coming up in the rendezvous and docking.
|CAPCOM|And just in case you got some left over, I want to shoot some of that black and white on the Moon. We got some instructions for you which we can call up in real time if you want to do it, different exposures. The CEX will be the same, of course, as the CEX is in the command module.
|SC|Okay. Bob, what factor on the black and white would you use?
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, if you use them, use the same sort you have on board for the CEX but you cut the shutter speed by a factor of 2. So it's - for instance you use 1/500 instead of 1/250. And so forth. Over.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Say, Bob, I don't think - at least I haven t heard anything, concerning the home front for about 4 days. You haven't by any chance had any contact have you?1... i
|CAPCOM|As a matter of fact, I haven't. And Gordy didn t talk to them tonight and - in fact Gordy and I talked about it on one of your - when we were doing the change over and I thought well it doesn't look like an opportune time to call up and find out right now. If you like, I can. I'm not sure whether they're still up or not, or I can leave Instructions for Overmeyer in the morning to round people up and see what's going on. Oh, I'll make sure Overmeyer
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 219:35 CST 0028 MC 858/2
219:35:00|CAPCOM|does It in the morning.
|SC|Haw, naw don't worry about it, Bob. I was just curious. I - no news is as good as good news1w
|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's my presumption. I kind of thought the day time people would have taken care of that. It's not the best time in the morning to call up right now. I'll make sure Overmeyer calls in the morning and checks on it. gq1Gordy gave us a briefing on the SIM bay and on the lunar surface experiments and it sounds like all that good laison work you did paid off. Sounds like most everybody is pretty satisfied.
|CAPCOM|As far as I can tell, that's right. We - we try there fellow.
|SC|We thank you.
|CAPCOM|What can I say? We thank you guys too.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 219 hours 54 minutes. 38 minutes remaining in this pass. The crew is eating at the present time. America's orbit now 65.4 by 62.3 nautical miles.

|SC|(garbled) is on.
|CAPCOM|Copy that, you just beat us by a minute and if you guys will give us 
|SC|It's already on, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and if you guys will give us the computer we'll1send those updates to you.
|SC|' Okay, you have the computer1.
|CAPCOM|Okay. And if you guys want to sit and listen X'll broadcast1you - it's possibly the world's shortest newscast.
|SC|Both covers are open and grey, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy that.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob, on the news. We were waiting for you1,
|CAPCOM|Oh, okay, I was waiting to see if you guys were ready to listen to it. The first item which has been a continuing item here during the flight - In Kansas City former President Harry S. Truman's condition continues to deteriorate as Doctors are unable to restore his vital kidney functions. On the Paris Peace Talks scene there has been essentially no apparent further developments today. It continues about the same. And in New York police are red-faced, it says, when it was learned that more than 50 pounds of heroin originally seized way back in 1962 - this is part of the French Connection business, has been stolen from the Police building where it was being kept as evidence. And a last local news item. Three prominent Houston men are missing. They were last seen in person at Cape Kennedy in Florida on December 6 but were apparently lost amont the 500 000 people who watched the launch of Apollo 17. The following appeal, it says, is issued in case they are listening. Gene, Jack and Ron come home. And if you pass a fellow with a bushy white beard and crimson suit, advise him you'll be home before Christmas. That s the extent of the news.
|SC|We saw him the other morning briefly, Bob, and all four of us will be around at the right time.
|CAPCOM|That's good news. We'll pass it on.
|SC|Bob, I've got some on-board readouts if you want them.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're ready to copy1(
|SC|I'll just give them to you - okay - I don t know if you've got - yeah, in order - 36.7 37 37 RCS at 68 61 65 an d 6 6 .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that and we'd like that battery manifold pressure reading that's 7A on the selector down there. 7 Alpha. - And, America, the computer is your's again.
|SC|Bob, 7 Alpha is 1.4.
|CAPCOM|Copy, 1.4 and to copy the computer is yours.
|SC|Yes sir. We got it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 01:07 GET 220:13 MC-860/1

|SC|Okay, Houston, you've got tank 1 is OFF, tank 2 is OFF and 3 is AUTO.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 220 hours 21 minutes. Clock shows 11 minutes 13 seconds before loss of signal on this revolution. However, because of the pointing angle of the high gain antenna on the spacecraft, which is now configured for the rest period, we anticipate an early LOS, perhaps 5 minutes prior to the clock time.
|SC|Hous ton, 17.
|CAPCOM|Roger, 17, go ahead.
|SC|Roger, as you - we approach having Earth-set you might be interested to know, being an astronomer, Bob, that we're getting a very bright specular reflection off the Earth now from the sun that produces — reproduces the suns image quite well.
|CAPCOM|Very good. And we're about, between 4 and 5 minutes from losing track of you guys tonight and you're go for LOS and go for sleep and we wont be saying any more to you coming around the horn but we'll be up listening to you though. But, we'll consider you guys going to sleep on the back side, over.
|SC|Okay, well, we're moving in that direction, partly to get the cabin cooled down, and we'll probably talk to you in the morning, before very long.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well then, open the windows if they get it cooled down to much, there.
|SC|By the way - okay.
|CAPCOM|And while you guys are sleeping to night you might be glad to know that the old orange team will be sitting around the fireplace and they'll all be singing Christmas Carols.
|SC|That I believe. Is Stan serving coffee to you?
|CAPCOM|We're holding out for egg nog tonight.
|SC|Well, goodnight, Robert.
|SC|Goodnight, Geno.
|SC|Well, that would be appropriate, I don't - I think it's about time they treated the MOCR to something .
|SC|Goodnight, Robert.
|CAPCOM|Goodnight, Ron. Say goodnight, Dick.
|SC|Goodnight, Dick. And we'll see you in the morning, I guess, Bob, if you're still around and if not we'll see you tomorrow about this time.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and by then you'll be headed home .
|SC|Yes sir. And if my home front's listen ing, I just want to say goodnight and sleep tight.

|SC|No, we had it and I think it's very appropriate for today. And that's exactly what we're going to do. Wait a minute and we'll play it back to you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's just -
|SC|(garble) none of those other guys.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. You've got about 3 1/2 minutes till LOS and you're looking good. All systems look good to us and have a good breakfast and we'll ses you on the other side.
|SC|Okay, Houston (garble).
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal as Apollo 17 spacecraft, America, coasted behind the moon nearing the end of revolution number 71. A briefing on Apollo 17 lunar surface science will begin momentarily in the main auditorium - repeat, main auditorium at MSC. The briefing likely will last into the next rev at least. The air-ground communications will be taped and played back at the conclusion of the lunar surface science press briefing. And at 228:28 ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control. APOLL 0 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 10:53 GET 230:00 870/1
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 230 hours ground elapsed time in the mission of Apollo 17. Now two thirds of the way across the front side of the Moon on lunar orbit number 42, and some 26 minutes away from loss of signal on this revolution. During the previous two-thirds of this 72 revolution, the Air-ground circuit has been down because of the press conference on Lunar Surface Science, underway in the main auditorium. We have some 24 minutes of tape accumulated from the air-ground. Primarily, the medical reports from the crew, the morning news and the usual exchanges that go on at this time of day, immediately after crew wakening. The crew was awakened near the end of revolution 71 with a recording by the Lettermen of "Light My Fire" which is appropriate for today inasmuch as the crew will light off the big engine in the service module to come out of lunar orbit, and begin the 3 day flight back home. We'll start rolling ' the accumulated tape and go live as soon as that tape is played out. This is Apollo Control.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Realize you're eating and don't want to interrupt you, but if you get your headsets on, we'll give you some news.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob, we'll listen to some news.
|CAPCOM|Okay, let's give you the really important news first. Went around the horn here and over in Nassau Bay. Everybody's doing real fine and it looks like Tracy's going to go out and visit one of our bigger amusement centers around the country and going to have a great day, and everybody just looks forward to the EVA and the deorbit and the splash. Out in El Lago - everybody's fine out there, Ron. John's out selling Christmas trees today and Jamie's going to go out shopping with her Aunt sometime today and a little Christmas shopping - it's getting near that time of year. And one of your friends from Phoenix is due in today for the rest of the Mission I guess. And out in Tucson, it was a little early this morning, Jack, but everybody's up and about, and I talked to your Mother, and everybody's fine. She's getting anxious to go back to Silver City and see all the celebration. I guess those people out there are really enjoying it. They're getting wild about it. But everybody's fine all the way around, all the way around.
|SC|Thank you, Bob .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd like REACQ and narrow.
|SC|We're fine up here and I'm sure you told them that.
|CAPCOM|Oh, I didn't have to tell them that - they're listening. They heard everything already this morning - at all 3 places.
|SC|Well, we send our "Good morning" and our last wakeup day from the Moon.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 10:53 GET 230:00 870/2
230:00:00|CAPCOM|Okay, here is a summary of the late news as compiled in the MSC Public Affairs Office. If you'd like it, we're ready to go with it.
|SC|Okay, we'd love to have it. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, everyone - everybody is talking about the success of the Apollo 17 mission here in Houston, and the weather. It was cold this morning. Some thermometers in the Houston metropolitan area were in the mid-20's. The lowest official temperature for the city of Houston was 31. I might add, Ellington had a recorded 29. A huge high pressure system is dominating the mid—section of the nation. Barometric pressure reached a high of 30.7 in the Houston area this morning at about 5:00 A.M. With strong gusty winds, the chill factor was a five above in Houston, and about a minus 10 degrees in Galveston. Man, that's cold. The national Christmas tree was lighted last night in Washington by Vice President Spiro Agnew. A small crowd, braving cold and rainy weather, watched as the vice president threw the switch to light up the 70-foot spruce that came from Medicine Bow, Wyoming. During the ceremony, Mr. Agnew said we must remember the many servicemen who are missing in action or prisoners of war in Indo-China and pray for them this holiday season. North Vietnamese peace talk negotiator Le Due Tho has told newsmen he is very optimistic about prospects for an early cease fire in Vietnam. Before leaving Paris, Le Due Tho said he will remian in very close contact with Dr. Henry Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger is in Washington. A Paris radio station has1. said a peace pact signing is imminent, but the report has been denied in Washington. Former Treasury Secretary John Connolly says he expects to get a call from President Nixon shortly to carry out some foreign visits this coming year. One assignment may be a visit to Moscow. John Scali, a former newsman for ABC and a special, consultant to President Nixon, is expected to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. A formal announcement from the White House is expected in a few days. An explosion has taken the lives of 21 men in West Virginia. The blast occured at a steel-making complex near Weirton, West Virginia, on the Ohio River. President Nixon has given the green light for a pay raise for all federal employees. The across-the-board increase of 5.14 percent will benefit both civilian and armed forces personnel. A 747 Jumbo Jet, while taking off out of Miami International yesterday, went through a flock of birds and reportedly lost -had an engine go out. The pilot turned the aircraft around and went out over the Atlantic and burned down some fuel and landed at Miami, but skidded off the runway, hit a concrete culvert, and sheared the nose gear. A few passengers fainted, but only 4 were injured when they went down the slide. The unexpected always deserves some attention. The small community of Westwood, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, will
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 10:53 GET 23:00 870/3
023:00:00|CAPCOM|send back a check it has received from the federal government in the federal revenue sharing program. Mayor Joe Dennis said Westwood just didn't need the money. On the regional and local scene - I just might add - I see it's not here that President Truman's condition seemed to deteriorate some last night, but he is still not listed on the critical list; he is serious. Miss Ima Hogg, the 90 year old founder of the Houston Symphony, was honored at a gala birthday party last night in a cake cutting ceremony at the Symphony. And little Tomball, Texas has had police trouble, but nearby Pasadena doesn't seem to have any. Thirteen new pretty policewomen have just joined the suburban police force out in Pasadena. And Jack, here's a special for you. If you ever get tired of cracking rocks, why not try politics. A geologist, J. Leonard Davidson, is going to run for mayor of Houston during the 1973 election. And we also received word this morning that an elementary school in Silver City, New Mexico, is being renamed for their most illustrious, graduate. It will now be the Harrison H. Schmitt Elementary School in Silver City, New Mexico. A couple of new college coaches have been named. Dave Smith has been named the new coach of Southern Methodist. Up in West Lafayette, Indiana, a veteran coach has been named to improve football fortunes at Purdue. Alex Agase, former head coach at Northwestern, will take over the Boilermakers. Kent Nix is expected to get the nod as starting quarterback for the Oilers against the Cincinnati Bengals in the final game of the year. Pastorini is still out with a pulled hamstring muscle. The Houston Rockets dropped their basketball game with the Baltimore Bullets last night by a score of 94 to 91. Purdue beat Western Kentucky last night 91 to 75. Friendswood High School was eliminated last night in the Class 2A semifinals as they bowed to Boling at Rice Stadium 33 to 7. And a final in the news today, Marian Rice Hart, the 81-year-old American aviatrix, says she has at least two more years left for flying. Mrs. Hart is currently flying around the world in a single engine Beechcraft Bonanza, She is presently in Katmandu, India. That's all from Editor Jim Kukowski here. A special hello from the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network crew around the world.
|SC|Thank you, Bob, and our hello and thank- you to the tracking team. We sure have been able to work well with them, and communications have been super.
|CAPCOM|That's real great. I'm sure those words will be appreciated up at Goddard and around the world of course .
|SC|Well, like a lot of other people - you know - you can't do it without them.
|SC|Bob, this is Jack. My appreciation and thanks for an unnecessary honor to Silver City. -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 10:53 GET 230:00 870/4

|CAPCOM|Roeer, Ron, we got all that.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Ron, could I jog your memory a minute back to the HF antenna extension period after docking?
|SC|Go ahead. We'll try.
|CAPCOM|Rog, Ron, we've been chasing a data dropout switch and we just wonder if trying to cover all bets - when you're extending HF antenna 1, could have you gone to operate on the immediate switch next to it which is the Lunar Sounder switch, was right next to one, could have gone to operate for a minute or two without realizing it while your hold - holding one to extend?
|SC|Standby, Bob. Which extension anomaly are you talking about, the one prior to rendezvous?
|CAPCOM|No, the one after rendezvous and docking when we were putting them with those - they're out now and when we put them out - whenever you're putting them out and we're extending HF antenna 1, the lunar sounder operate switch is immediately connected to It and I realize HF antenna is a momentary switch when you're holding it there could have you gone to operate on that lunar sound equip?
|SC|Bob, I don't think so. I - no. No. I don't think so.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good show, good show. Okay we'll keep track of that.
|SC|I would have had - I would have had to been gone to the off position, too, I guess, right after that and I think I'd remember that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/82 11:03CST 230:10GET MC871/2
230:10:00|CAPCOM|Yeah, that's affirm. You would have had to go to off here and I didn't feel it but Joe and you know we got a data glitch - it's nothing serious - no problem - but they're just back there trying to track down all little glitches, and that does seem to be the only thing that could add up right now.
|SC|Sure, I - I understand. I understand. Yep. Hey, Bob, have you had any more charge firings on surface?
|CAPCOM|I don't believe so. When I came on shift they mentioned that the LCRU wasn't working right now and they were trying to work it.
|SC|Okay, just for an update we fired 6 and 7 last night and we'll be firing 1 at about 1 o'clock this afternoon.
|SC|They all went off okay, huh?
|CAPCOM|Yeah, and 4, 1 and 8 go off today. And we're seeing good results back on all the data.
|SC|Okay, has Bob Kovach gotten any depth to the debris cover or anything below it yet?
|CAPCOM|Let me check that out here before I get it to you, piecemeal here — we'll check it out.
|SC|I realize that's pushing a little bit but I'm curious.
|SC|Bob, how do you read 17?
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I'm looking right down the slope of the South Massif above the slide right now. Right down in just about the angle of the slope and there's a very light indentation in the slope just opposite the maximum - the point of maximum extent of the light mantle. Opposite other portions of it, though, there's no clear indication of any change in the direction of the Massif front. It's very, very slight and I'd say you'd have a hard time saying that it is a source area for the light mantle but it's -there's a slight indentation.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I'm just north of the - of the bright rayed craters in the Littrow area. There are 5 craters, oh probably in the thousand meter diameter class range, 500 to 1000 and all five of those have the sequence of colors in the walls from rim down of a brown gray - blue gray and then brown gray. They are all identical in that sequence and quite clear.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And that blue gray is comparable to the blue gray that's visible in the craters such as Sherlock in the landing area. And along the - Robin in the vicinity of those 5 craters there is a series of very black spots. I'm going to have to look at that again on the next pass if we can. I don't have any idea what those spots are but I'm looking very obliquely now to that Robin and - -APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 11:13 CST 230:20 GET MC-872/1
|AMERICA|Very bleakly now to that Robin and it's extremely - black spots along that Robin.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Ron, NOUN 26 doesn't require a sign.
|AMERICA|Thank you, Bob. I've heard more about SP 20 on this side of the tunnel this mission than I ever could have.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Looks like you guys are ready to go to work .
|AMERICA|Well (laughing) yep, we are. We're ready to do anything you want to do.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we need a cut like your CSM state vector.
|AMERICA|Okay, sock it to us.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's on its way. Going down the flight plan, we've got a flight plan update if you're ready to copy. Isn't too awful long, although it's not the easiest one.
|AMERICA|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 230:20, 230:20 add the following: Laser altimeter, off, LA off.
|AMERICA|Just keep pressing on, Bob, I'll get them and let you know if I get them all.
|CAPCOM|Okay, at 230:20, laser altimeter, off; at 230:29, add verify all VHF off; at 230:31, delete waste water dump; at 230:40, scratch out LMP and put CDR don biomed harnesses. Put CDR in place of LMP.
|AMERICA|Hey, that wasn't a flight plan update we passed on yesterday, I've got those.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just keep going on down the line here. At 231:29, change - check LMP biomed to check Commander biomed, and change CDR doff to CMP doff. Okay. And the computer's yours, by the way. You can make a block. And this is the one important one here, we want to make sure, and I'll explain a little bit, over at 232:27, 232:27, if lunar sounder operate talkback flag goes barber pole, switch lunar sounder operate to standby. The situation here is that it might run out of film during this lunar sounder HS target on hertz (garble) . If it does, we need to go to standby immediately and it'll probably require somebody monitoring that panel during that 5 to 6 minute pass there. Our best guess is - our best guess is we've got a 5 minute PAD on that film but this is just a precaution. And at 233:13 after pan camera power add V over H override high altitude. Okay, that ends the flight plan update. I've got a lunar sounder PAD,
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Okay, lunar sounder PAD is at 230:55, 230:55 T-start time: 231:00.00. T-stop time is at 0758.
|AMERICA|Is that everything, or you got a couple more sounder PAD's?
|CAPCOM|Ah', that's the only sounder PAD for now.
|AMERICA|Okay, if - let me just run it back through you to make sure1I got them right.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 1]/16/72 11:13 CST 230:20 GET MC-872/2
230:20:00|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|AMERICA|Okay, at 230:21 you want the laser altimeter off. At 230:30 you want to verify all the VHF is off. And we want to eliminate the waste water dump at 230:31. The sounder PAD on that page is 231:00 and 231:07.58. At 232 following lunar sounder operate for that PAD, if the operate talkback goes barber pole, we want to switch the lunar sounder operate to standby, and we'll be monitoring the panel during that time. And at 233:12 following pan camera to Power, you want V over H to high alt.
|CAPCOM|That's a good readback, Gene. I have a PDI 75 preliminary TEI 75 PAD for your update book.

And the 02 and H2 are basically right on the flight plan and there we've got plenty remaining. No problem on that. And for the - for Jack for the LMP I've got a special flight plan update on you crew option photo target on Kukowski. Would you like to copy that?
|SC|St and by one.
|CAPCOM|And we'd like high-gain to AUTO.
|SC|Okay, Bob, what's this update?
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, it's 232:55 this is the LMP crew option photo target Seocoski.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, they're recommending CM5 to EL 80 or 250 - I guess your option HPW - maybe that should be VHPW - I'll take that out but HPW is what they've got here - exposure from crew option photo chart as listed except change l/250th to l/500th for the 80 millimeter lens. Change l/125th to l/250th for the 250 millimeter lens. Recommend use lunar surface mag Kilo Kilo. That's use lunar surface mag Kilo. Record frame number for start-stop.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I've been corrected that is HPW. That's one of those surface mags that I guess I don't know anything about. And we would like cryo tank configuration H2 tank 3 fans to OFF; H2 tank 2 fans to ON. Over.
|SC|Okay, you've got that and the photo pads are mag. kilo, vee the 80 or 250 millimeter lens. HPW exposures as per chart except change l/250th to l/500th for the 80 and l/125th to l/250th for the 250 millimeter lens.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|And record the frames.
|CAPCOM|Good show.
|SC|Bob, just had a good view of the sun set and the corona and there are two strong bright streamers just right at sunset. One parallel to the plane of the ecliptic and the other - oh, maybe 10 degrees to the south of the plane and they form two of the major longer daw - daughter streamers that are streaming out from the sun now. There are some other linear streamers that are still visible but those were the major ones. Once you get out about to the position of Mars, they all have about the same intensity, which is very low.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 11:23 CST 230:30 GET MC873/2
230:30:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|The pattern is distinctly different from the one I beleive I mentioned to you yesterday.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It was right at sunset at any rate. Still have a very strong glow visible at the sunset point.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And that glow - the - the general glow visible to me now - and of course I'm not very well lighted adapted dark adapted - but extends about to a position - oh, let's see - about the same distance from the Sun as the apparent distance of Venus between Venus and Mars right now. Well, let me - let me start over on that. The apparent distance of Venus to Mars is about the same distance as from Mars to the limit of the strong solar glow.
|CAPCOM|See the NOUN 05.
|SC|Talk about streamers. I'm talking about lens. Say again.
|CAPCOM|I said, "We see the NOUN 05". Go ahead, Jack.
|SC|Okay, I just wanted to tell you I've seen it and talking about each time. Very linear bright lines that extend, oh, maybe 2 or 3 crate - solar diameters out and then they merge quite sharply into a very long much duller streamers that - I guess presumably are zodiacal light.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. We see the NOUN 93 if you can torque.
|SC|Okay, we're torquing at 45 now. Bob, I'm going to torque at 230:14.

|SC|Okay, just looking at the GARBLE going through there again and the outer beta ridge on that thing is kind of like the one — you know I saw above REV 62 in the picture, but the outer rim - is (garbled) in the opposite direction from the normal crater -there was a deep slope. And on the outside of the rim - you have a gradual slope up to the GARBLE. From the center of the crater you've got a gradual slope up to the rim and then it drops off to the steep slope on the outside. And the steep slope on the outside is maybe oh, 35 to 45 degrees -the slope on the inside is probably - somewhere around 20 degrees I guess. And there is one portion of the rim — kind of on the western portion of the one that I was looking at, anyhow, it's almost a delta shaped ring.

|SC|Okay, I was just kind of reminiscing a little bit about the - my mud puddle craters there in Smythii. I guess that's what GARBLE with one of them. They've always kind of look alike to me. But they slope up. But the rims of those craters and even the interior rims on ones that are multi-ringed they slope upward from the center of the crater toward the rim and a gradual slope and then they drop off on the outside to the crater rim, sloping down from the outside crater up to 45 degrees and then at some points on there it almost look like it's a real plastic delta shaped rim on them where you have the same slope on the inside as well as the outside of the crater.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|Houston, you ready for mode VHF?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.

|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|AMERICA|All right, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we'did not get the high gain to NARROW, we have sequence for you which is important to go through so that we'do not break lock and lose this lunar sounder VHF data. We would like you to dial in pitch minus 45, yaw 5, go to Manual Wide and when you get the signal strength, go to REACQ and then step to the beam Narrow, Medium, and Wide, or say in Wide narrow and Me di um.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm with you. Okay, I got minus 45 on the pitch, plus about 5 on the yaw --
|CAPCOM|That should be minus 45 on the pitch.
|AMERICA|— and, what was that? That's what I got. Minus 45. And plus 5 on the yaw, right?
|CAPCOM|Affirmative. We're ready for you to do it, go ahe ad.
|AMERICA|And, we're going to Manual and wide. How's that?
|CAPCOM|That's great; we'didn't drop any. That's great.
|AMERICA|(Garble) Hello, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|AMERICA|Okay, this is Gene. I've got a very inter esting crater out there in Tranquility I'd like to pass some info on for you. (Garble) It's part of the central part of Tranquility. It's got a very sharply raised lip, and it's got a very dark (garble) deposit. It's got a very, very obvious (garble) looks like it's elongated, basically to the generally to the east and to the west. I can't tell, but because of the shape of it, and because of those a — darker rim deposits, I'm sure there must be an event there somewhere, but it' s too dark down in there. I can't really see for sure whether there is one or not. But, if there is, I imagine it's pretty big. And, I can't tell, it's only sort of intuitive, but I imagine the elongation was produced during the thrust of the initial dynamics, the formation of the impact.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. Do you have a scale on the size of the crater?
|AMERICA|Ask me about it. Let me look. Bob, yeah, — I may have said Tranquility. I meant Fecunditatis. I did not mean Tranquility.
|CAPCOM|Copy.
|AMERICA|Bob, I'11 have to give you an estimate on the - on the relative size of it, but the length to width ratio is probably about 2 to 1,- and it's certainly bigger than the Camelot s iz e ran ge.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's good. Just wanted to pin it down further1.

231:40:00|CAPCOM|17, just for your information, it's Miami 3 Baltimore 01- they're about midway through the first quarter and Miami's1making an effort to go undefeated today.
|SC|It's the last game of their season isn't it? _
|CAPCOM|That's right. This will be the undefeated season if they hack it.
|SC|Houston, America. I took that reference - information a couple of 3 days ago that - however, when we first got up here - that I had a heck of a time seeing that Tycho ray that goes out across Bessels. And I forgot to tell you that yesterday - kind of for the first time - It really started showing up when we were getting up in the higher sun. And today it really shows up quite vividly. It's just a ray that takes off from the engines during Crisium and goes right across Bessel and goes out to about the middle of Crisium - I don't mean Crisium, I mean Serenitatis, I was talking about Serenitatis all the time.
|CAPCOM|Right.
|SC|Say, Bob. Those craters on the south western side of Serenitatis still have got that orange hue at the sun angle, and that's with the naked eye.
|CAPCOM|Roger. These are the ones right in the Skulpicius Gallus region?
|SC|Yes.
|SC|Hey, Houston, 166 and 167 are taken of a crater that looks like it's got a reddish stripe on it (garble) to the west of (garble)
|SC|Houston, a little more on that. It's an impact crater with a line essentially across the diameter in a east-west direction, maybe a little bit north of west direction and the ejecta to the north of that. We just went under - the ejecta to the north of the line is the orange —actually more red—brown then orange, although they're both hues in it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Can you give us some scale on that crater.
|SC|Looks similar to - yes, it's about a 600 meter crater. And it looks very much like - in it's geologic pattern to the - that crater out in the Nevada test site on Buckboard Mesa that had an explosion along a contact between 2 very sharply contrasting rock types. In this case, however, the line does not go completely across the crater, and that's why we feel it may be a dike or a vein which pertuitively has been hit by that impact.
|CAPCOM|Okay, can you give me a little relation ship with respect to Skulpicius Gallus, the crater?
|SC|Yes, I'll try to spot it in a minute.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 12:33 GET 231:40 877/2
231:40:00|CAPCOM|Okay, why don't you just mark it on your map so for pre - postflight we'll have it.
|SC|On the - somewhere around, I'll try to spot it more exactly, 20 north latitude line at about 7 east on a ridge. It's right on top of a ridge. I think it's that ridge. I'll try to spot it more exactly later.

|SC|Okay. Thank you.
|SC|Okay, Bob. We'll just terminate those last 2 steps, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay. You still want mapping cameras, stand by up there in the fourth step.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|SC|Okay, Houston. The SIM BAY Is powered up. We eliminated the last 2 steps.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Thank you, Gene.
|SC|Okay, Houston. I guess you saw those - we got through those procedures and you probably saw most of the switching. Sorry I should have been in VOX.
|CAPCOM|No problem,
|PAO|This is Apollo Control we're going to repeat the playback of the video tape of the explosive package number 7. This will be the final time it will be played back. If you'll look in the lower left corner behind a slight ridge, you'll see a glow part way through the playback. Let's watch the playback n ow.
|SC|Houston, this 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|One of the questions we asked ourselves years ago, when we mapped the Copernicus area, was were we really seeing dark mantling deposits on some of the Massifs of the Carpathions and looking at it obliquely here, it - some of those areas that we've mapped as dark mantling are distinctly brownish grey versus the normal tan grey of the - of most of the Carpathions. It looks like - and it's about the same color as extrapolating - as the dark mantle around Sulpicius and Taurus-Lit trow .
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Also, the north boundary, the Carpathion Massifs have a very sharply defined high lava margin,and that's actually what we're seeing. And in - I'll mark the place on the map, but it looks like it extends about a 6th to an 8th of the way up the highest peak. It's quite a striking and obvious mark. There's a major textural change below the mark there's a little scarp that defines it, the texture is very smooth. Above that it has the lineated and typical mountain front texture for the Apennine - for the Imbrium range.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Bob, I might summarize my impression of the Rilles in the vicinity of Euler and their relationship to j
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 12:43 GET 231:50 MC-878/2
231:50:00|SC|the mare ridges. I've been able to oh, over the last 3, just generally searching it out, I've been able to find Rilles that clearly cross and separate portions of ridges. And ridges that clearly cross and partially bury Rilles. And in another third case a rille that appears to be levied - that is have banks of - flat banks on either side
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 12:53 GET 232:00 879/1
232:00:00|SC|The sides, but near the end of it, it transitions Into a mare ridge very clearly. It looks as if to me that the rille and ridge problem in here is just one of repitative compression and extension within the sufficial flows of the Imbrium basin. And that possibly during the compressive stages there were extrusions locally along the ridge system, but the main part the ridge systems represent I think a domean it looks like just a domean of the mare surface except for these local ridge like extrusions.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I might also add that the rilles to me seems to be made up of zig zag straight line segments rather than being truly senuous. They appear senuous because of the rounding of the corners, but in my impression is that their really made up of straight line segments.
|SC|And Houston on mag victor victor - oh, well I'm on number 28 now and the last ones before 28 there were taken of the spacecraft sunset terminator.
|CAPCOM|Roger Ron. Jack we just had a feed in to your answer to your question from ALSEP. The PI has not seen enough data at this time to draw any conclusions regarding the depth of the mantle in the landing area. And, we've got another bomb charge due to go off here in about -a short time let me check it,
|SC|Okay, I'll wait till we get back. Thank you.
|CAPCOM|That next charge goes off in 15 minutes, Jack. I don't have an exact GET yet.
|SC|Bob, is the LCRU still working?
|CAPCOM|Say again, please.
|SC|Bob, this is Geneo I was just wondering if the LCRU and the TCU were still working?
|CAPCOM|They think the LCRU failed last night.
|CAPCOM|Gene, they are going to try it again today, but they could not get a razit last night and they think its failed.

|SC|Has Mark come up with a preliminary heat flow number yet or is he still equilibrating?
|CAPCOM|We'll check that, Jack,
|CAPCOM|Jack, nothing on that heat flow yet. It's still stabilizing. It'll be a while before they get any data. But we're watching the data playout here on the TV screen. They just had another one of those charges go off and It really does rap the old heaters.

Whatever frame they were on on the lunar surface to 143 were selected shots by the LMP. Frame 143 to 172 were nearsight terminator photos of Ts iolkovsky.

|CAPCOM|Let me see. We've got one sitting right in front of us for 233:40. Do you want that one?
|SC|I don't have that one. I've got that one that starts at 24:07 and ends at 38:42.

|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. And let me give you some words here that you might be Interested in. Right now we're looking at probably pulling in those antennas at 233:45 or 46, right in that time frame. If those maneuvers, that should not work, we will have to jettison the antennas at around 234:3, 235:39. We have and we won't give it to you until we need it. We have V49 maneuver to a jet attitude for 234:25 and that'll keep in that attitude and
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 233:08 CST 14:01 MC882/2
233:08:00|CAPCOM|then we'll jettison the antennas at 235:43, and of course we'll have to bring up the logic power on those. We have this all available standing by and there's no sense passing it until we find out how the antennas do on retract,
|SC|Okay, that sounds reasonable. Do you have the, or you want to use the page in the experiment checklist there?
|CAPCOM|Roger, except for the NOUN 78's . We'll change tho se.
|SC|Oh, okay. Sounds good.
|SC|It's in the Volkswagen pocket. Okay.
|SC|I don't think we ever changed it though. Okay, the arrow's there, which indicates that we'didn't do it. Okay, file cannister change 19 into A, take 17 and put it into A4. That s correct. At 24 we want pan camera.
|SC|Bob, while we're wa.iting for the pan camera time, quickly here. One of the ways that seems to be useful for determining the relative age of the larger basins, to me anyway, is the abundance of block fields on the slopes of the walls or the slopes of the central peaks. That abundance decreasing with increasing age and one of the comparisons that just made that it looks as if Tsiolkovsky and Sklodowska have about the same abundance of block fields on both those features of the crater. Presumably they would be about the same age.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. I noted that.
|SC|Jack to me, Sklodowska is lot more subdued, though, than Tsiolkovsky on the ... Oh, okay.
|SC|It's just criteria? Yes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 14:11 GET -233:18 883/1
-233:1:00|SC|And Houston the northern portions - I hate to use mud impact but that's what I'll call it Mouldering Basin structure there and it also has a delta shaped rim to it. There is kind of a moat between the inner ring and the outer ring and then it slopes again a gradual slope from the center of the crater up to the porous basin ring and with a steeper slope on the outside of the first ring going down into the moat. And then the outer ring has the delta - the delta shaped rim to it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron we copy that.

Yes, that's alright I can do it. I'll lay it down beside it. There we go. That's 80 to 250 that'll be good. Okay, is that what we call star? Okay, that's right, I didn't think this was star. That'e the one I was talking about having the splygional base on it and it's west of Mare Smythii for sure I don't know where we - directly south of - eastern edge of Fecunditatis.

|SC|Outstanding, you have accept. And, while we are getting a TEI REFSMMAT there's a fairly striking graben on the very north edge of Fecunditatis south of Crisium. Just south of Crisium and it starts in the west within the Fecunditatis mare and then curves gradually up through the Sculptured Hills structure to the north. And, there is a crater looks like a subdued impact crater right on taht structure, and you can see the trace of the graben down the walls - the west wall of the crater and up the east wall. And it does -from directly overhead and appears to taper downward. The walls of the graben that is get closer together as approach the bottom of the crater. And on the south wall of the graben as exposed in the west wall of the crater there is a fairly sharp - sharply defined white area in the talus.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 14:21 GET 233:28 884/1
233:28:00|CAPCOM|America the computer's yours you can go to b1ock.
|SC|Okay, we're in block.
|SC|With the old pan camera ready we probably can find that graben section there pretty well. Yes, we ought to get some good pictures. It isn't quite as good that way, but you do get some pictures.
|SC|That's what I was trying to figure out. Houston, what's that big crater we're going over right now in Fecunditatis. It's probably on your map - yes, Taruntius that's it, yes. Ah, speaking of grabens again - hows our pan camera?
|SC|38 and we still got 18,
|SC|Speaking of grabens again, on the south eastern blanket of Taruntius about a crater radius outward there is a crater looks like an impact also on a trace of a graben and in this case the ejecta blanket that extends out along the graben most of the west and to the east is noticeably blue gray against tan gray of the Fecunditatis (garble) Taruntius ejecta blanket. Basically, it looks like blue gray wings on the crater along the direction of the grab en.
|CAPCOM|Roger Jack.
|SC|Looking at the crater (Garble) in the north eastern and northern portions of Tranquility. It looks as if you could say that there is blue gray mare materials overlying very light gray material of some kind. Without any strong exceptions that I can see and it resembles the same (garble) that I think I talked about yesterday on the anulus of Serenitatis and that goes along with what I think Ron told you that the visual appearance of the anulus and the northern tranquility mare on the surface is indistinguishable.
|SC|It also suggests that the mare in the (garble) thin as your getting down to whatever the basement rock is and that being represented by the light gray. The legends of the blue gray material are high up in the crater and really appear to form only about - oh a fifth to a sixth of the wall height. And I'll give you a crater - there's a crater right between the two Couchie rilles that shows this fairly well. And Ross crater also shows it a little farther along I remember from last time.
|SC|Couchie Crater isn't it?
|SC|Yes, Couchie crater is the one I was talking about between the two rilles. Actually, it's not as well defined in Couchie as it is in some of the other crate rs .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 14:21 GET 233:28 884/2
233:28:00|SC|The western end of the Couchie rilles both north and south seem to have a right lateral (garble) on structure, but along the trades still to the west of the crater couchie that locally changes to less lateral.
|SC|And, Houston even at the high sun angle here the ejecta of the - oh it's four or five recent craters there at Miraldi still kind of a bluish gray light bluish gray. The floor of the crater Miraldi is essentially a dark form a dark gray today I guess than anything. And, the ejecta patterns on that are the same albedo and color distinctions as the ones at the landing site. And, the landing site itself from this angle I think it's going to - no, once we get up at the same viewing angle as we had on Miraldi the matleing material in the landing site is the same color same albedo as Miraldi.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|In the crater Miraldi.
|SC|Yes, I get just a tint of - yes I was going to say well I still get a feeling that there is just a twinge of orange or tanish orange around Shorty looking at it with the binocs. That black bump on the sides — let's see south of the southern sides of the south massif. Can you see that one Jack?

|CAPCOM|America, Houston. After we start the pan camera at 233:48:15, we would like then to go and start to retract HF antenna number 2. Number 2 first please.
|SC|Okay. So when I get the pan camera started, we'll go to retract on that.
|SC|Jack, are you talking about the one that's got the red ejecta out to the east. Yes. Right now. Just now looking down there. Is that the one you were talking about? Okay. It's just now coming up. Okay, can you see Decaldare? Okay. Okay, I'll get it. Let's see, we're almost at subsolar. Wait a minute, I don't know where we are. Right. We're way past subsolar. Yes, I think.
|SC|Okay, Houston, on Papa, Papa frames 13 and 14 were of the crater with the red brown orange vein across it and 15 and 16 were of Decaldare, stereo pairs.
|SC|See your (garble) lights Jack.
|SC|Hey, Houston, I saw at least two other examples of impact craters in the highland south of Serenitatis, south of the Sovicius area that had vein—like distribution of red brown or orange material in them.

|SC|Houston knows. How about long is it supposed to take to retract (garble) this time. S1(laughter) any (garbled)
|CAPCOM|Ah, 130 seconds would be nominal retraction1.
|SC|130, huh. Would be nominal? No. 2, yeah.
|SC|Yeah, it's number one on your side.
|SC|Yeah that's the one. We had trouble getting it out, the second1time. Can't find my dip. Just took a long time to get out there. Yeah, we're taking it out now.
|SC|Gene, yeah, we're doing this now but we need a T-stop here, just a - on the pan camera.
|CAPCOM|How does the barber pole look up there, boys?
|SC|(garbled) It looks gray. Okay,
|CAPCOM|That's a full retract.
|SC|Good. Beautiful.
|SC|Now you want to do number 1.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative and the time of the other was (garble).

|PAO|This is Apollo control. We've had loss of signal as the spacecraft America passed behind the Moon on revolution number 74 will be out of sight from the Earth for approximately 28 or 48 minutes. Coming up in 2 hours and 16 minutes on the transearth injection burn behind the Moon during - at the end of revolution number 75. To repeat the ignition time currently is ground elapsed time of 236:42:08.

234:17:00|PAO|A burn of 3046.9 feet per second to boost the spacecraft out of lunar orbit and on a trajectory toward Earth. A splashdown in the South Pacific Tuesday afternoon. The spaceflight meteorology group of the national weather service said this afternoon that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 next Tuesday. A weather forecast for the planned landing area which is located about 350 miles southeast of American Samoi calls for scattered to broken clouds, winds of 10 knots, three foot seas and temperatures near 81 degrees. Members of the white team of flight controllers are beginning to drift in for the band over just prior to acquisition of signal next revolution. We're estimating a change of shift press conference at approximately 4 p.m. in the small briefing room with the off going flight director Neil Hutchinson. To repeat estimated change of shift press conference at 4 o'clock small briefing room Houston News Center. At 234:26 this is Apollo control.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 234:48 CST 15:41 MC891/1
234:48:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 234 hours 48 minutes. We'll be regaining radio contact with Apollo 17 in about 20 minutes. The change of shift press briefing is ready to start momentarily in the MSC News Center briefing room. We'll switch you to the briefing room at this time.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 16:00 GET 235:08 MC892/1
235:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 235 hours 8 minutes. Now less than one minute from regaining radio contact with Apollo 17. And, when once again we hear from the crew, they should be in the midst of eating their last meal in lunar orbit. Everything is in very good shape for the trans-Earth insertion maneuver to be performed at the end of this revolution, and at the beginning of the 76th revolution as they come around the front side of the Moon, they'll be on their way back to Earth. During this front-side pass, we'll be passing up to the crew the final set of numbers that'll be fed into their computer targeting the trans-Earth injection burn. Also, we have the times for acquisition of signal following TEI. With the normal TEI burn, we would expect to acquire signal at 236 hours 55 minutes. If for some reason, the burn is not performed as planned, we would regain radio contact at 239 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. And, we should have AOS momentarily.
|PAO|I wanted to make one correction to the AOS times there. Without the burn, if the transEarth injection burn is not performed, the acquisition of signal time is 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds rather than 239 hours, as we gave you. Again those times. With the burn, 236 hours 55 minutes; without the burn, 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. That would be about 12 minutes 18 seconds later if the burn is not done.
|PAO|We've got good solid telemetry from the space craft .

|CAPCOM|America, Houston, with some words about the pan camera operation after TEI.
|SC|Okay, go ahead .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we haven't talked about this, but we noticed a failure during the last operation of the pan camera of the Stereo. It's completely failed and, so, when you go to OPERATE, which is about 7 minutes after AOS after TEI, you can expect to get a Barber Pole after three frames have cycled through. Want you to just ignore that and let her run. We figure you have two minutes of film left, but we won't be able to monitor in the film because you'll be on TV on the FM, so we're going to limit the pan camera operations to 5 minutes total, and we'll be able to give you the mark when to turn if off after the 5 minutes. Over.

|CAPCOM|That sounds good.
|SC|Okay, Houston. The pan camera is going to boost. And also we're presently configured with the IR on and the cover open. Apparently Flight Plan neglected to have us turn it off, or are we supposed to burn with it open.
|CAPCOM|Let me check that.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We'd like the IR cover closed, to keep the Sun out of it.
|SC|Okay, and you want the instrument off?
|CAPCOM|Negative. Leave the IR on and I, I'll get back to you in a minute on all these covers.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. Cover's closed and we'll wait your further word.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. On the covers, we want all three covers closed, according to the pre-SPS burn cue card. The instruments, the IR and UV, keep running until after TEI, when you open the covers back up per the flight plan. Over.

236:02:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I think this is what you wanted to hear you're go for TEI.
|SC|Outstanding.
|SC|Okay, Gordo understand America is go for TEI and I'll give you a confirm on the star here in just a s e cond.
|CAPCOM|Okeydok.
|SC|Say Gordo I've got the moon now (garble) in the telescope be just a little bit before I can give you a confirm on that, but the dap is set.
|SC|Okay, we'll go ahead and go into P40.
|SC|Houston 17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Gordie, could you give me a summary of what your expectations are on the operation of the PUGS.
|CAPCOM|Okay, just a minute.
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston, we expect you'll need de crease throughout the whole burn. However, we'd like you to control does require to keep it in a green band.
|SC|Okay, and why do you expect that, Gordie? I missed one of the burns.
|CAPCOM|Just the way it's worked from past history. That's what we expect this time.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, Houston we're down to six minutes in the checklist except for the star sextant check.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene.
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston, with a further word on the PUGS. We have noticed after ignition on previous burns some oscillation. We suggest you stay in decrease for the first 25 seconds or so, till it stabilizes before you start controlling it.
|SC|Roger, Gordie.
|SC|Houston, the star sextant check is go.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, about 2 minutes till LOS. One reminder about the DSE we'd Like you to go to low bit rate just prior to LOS as per the flight plan. And then go back to high bit rate at 6 minutes prior to ignition per your burn que card and you can just leave it in high bit rate from there on th rough AOS. We just went around the room once more everything looks good. Have a good burn and we'll see you and the TV picture as you come out the other side. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordie, the.nk you. We're looking forward to a good burn. And, we'll see you coming out the other s ide.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 16:55 GET 236:02 898/2
236:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo control* We've now had loss of signal. Apollo 17 completing it's last full revolution of the Moon. Flight director Chuck Lewis has just advised his flight controllers this would be a good time to take a 10 or 15 minute break and then be back on the consoles ready for acquisition of signal at which time Apollo 17 should be on its way back to Earth. The final set of numbers passed up to the crew to perform the transearth injection burn are very close to those that we had earlier. A couple of very minor changes. The ignition time is 236 hours 42 minutes 8 seconds. That represents a change of one second. The total burn duration remains unchanged essentially at 2 minutes 25 seconds. And this will impart an increase in velocity to the spacecraft of 3046 feet per second and that represents a decrease of 1 foot per second over the numbers we had previously. Splashdown is targeted for a ground elapsed time of 304 hours 31 minutes 25 seconds in the Pacific southeast of Samoi. The targeted splashdown coordinates are 17 degrees 54 minutes south and 166 degrees west. The television picture as Apollo 17 comes around into acquisition of signal. We regain radio contact should be a very spectacular view of the lunar surface, The spacecraft at the time we acquire should be at an altitude of about 291 miles above the lunar surface moving out at more than 55 hundred miles per hour and it will be almost directly over the crater Tsiolkovsky which is on the lunar farside normally not visible from Earth. This will be the second time that we have - -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 236:35 CST 17:18 MC899/1
236:35:00|PAO|This will be the second time that we've had a chance to view the lunar far side via television from Apollo mission. The first time occurred on Apollo 10. We were discussing that mission with the Commander of Apollo 10 Gen. Tom Stafford, who's here in the Control Center. Stafford also recalled it being a very spectacular view, as all lunar crews have reported. One thing he did point out is that Apollo 10 had significantly more velocity at transearth injection than Apollo 17 will have. Had a shorter trip time of something like 40 hours for the return compared with about 68 hours for the return time on Apollo 17. This would perhaps cause the Moon to shrink a little less rapidly than we recall it from Apollo 10, but nevertheless, should be a very spectacular sight. The previous crews have described it, the Moon is looking as if you were in a high performance jet aircraft going straight up and the Moon goes from filling the TV screen to shrinking into a discernable sphere A relatively short period of time. A matter of 10 to 15 minutes as we recall. Again, the acquisition of signal time, the time at which we should have radio contact with Apollo 17, given a normal TEI burn is 236 hours 55 minutes. We have a clock in the Control Center, counting down to that acquisition time. We're now 28 minutes 14 seconds from acquisition. If, for some reason, the transearth injection burn was not performed, we would acquire about 12 minutes later at 237 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds. This is due to the fact that without the burn the spacecraft remains in a lower orbit, does not clear the lunar horizon and become visible to antennas on Earth as soon. Everything has continued to progress very smoothly leading up to transearth injection. On the last front side pass, we sent up the final numbers to the crew. They made the final checks of their guidance and navigation equipment and as they went around the corner of the Moon, everything was looking absolutely normal. we'did have one minor unexplained situation occur at the start of the revolution. Gene Cernan reported that he tried for 4 or 5 minutes to establish radio contact and apparently not getting through. The instrumentations communications officer here in the Control Center checked with the various tracking sites, both the prime and backup sites, and they all confirmed that: they had rot heard downlink from the spacecraft, although we'did have, that: is, voice downlink, we'did have good telemetry lock on and good solid signal strength. The indications that we had, bcth on the ground and from the spacecraft were that everything was in the normal configuration and we simply have no explanation for that 4 or 5 minutes when the crew was unable to contact us. But the communications equipment has continued to work absolutely normally. No sign of any problem and no concern. This burn of course is performed while the spacecraft is behind the Moon, so we have no data on the maneuver. We'll
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 236:35 CST 17:18 MC899/2
236:35:00|PAO|get our first report, of it as the crew comes back around on the lunar front side. Comparing this transearth injection maneuver burn with previous burns, it's interesting to observe the Flight Controllers. They're certainly all aware that this is a significant event, leaving the Moon for the final time in the Apollo Program, but the atmosphere here in the Control Center is not much different from previous transearth injection burns that we've observed. Having watched the spacecraft and crew perform this same maneuver flawlessly seven times previously, there's obviously less of the tension that was evident at this time after Apollo 8, when Apollo 8 was preparing to leave the Moon four years ago. We have a number of small clusters of people gathered around in casual conversation and in about 5 or 10 minutes, I'm sure we'll see everyone returning to consoles, getting set to receive that first data from the spacecraft. We're now 12 minutes away from the time at which the crew will be igniting their 20,500 pound thrust service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes and 25 seconds of what* s been described as a rather stiff kick in the tail for the spacecraft. It's starts it on it's path back to Earth. An d we're now about 25 minutes from reacquiring radio contact with Apollo 17. At 236 hours 31minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 17:44 GET 236:52 MC900/1
236:52:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 236 hours 52 min utes. We're now a little less than 3 minutes away from the time we expect to regain radio contact with Apollo 17. And, at that time, we should get confirmation from the crew that America is enroute back to Earth. We have another clock counting here in the Control Center for the acquisition time that we can expect, if the Trans Earth Injection burn was not performed, and that now shows 14 minutes 42 seconds until acquisition of signal. That again is the time that we would acquire if the Trans Earth Injection burn was not done; as planned. We have an interesting display at the present time; which is called up by our Flight Dynamics Officer, and this display shows what the computers here in the Control Center predict that the current velocity of the spacecraft and its altitude are, based on the assumption that the burn was performed as planned. And, if that assumption is correct, Apollo 17 at this tine is traveling at some 7800 feet per second and is at an altitude of about 237 miles above the Moon and climbing rapidly. And, we're now less than 1 1/2 minutes away from acquisition of signal.
|PAO|We're now less than 30 seconds from acquisi tion of signal. The next call will be INCO's, the instrumentation and communications engineer letting us know that we have radio signals from the spacecraft. We'll be receiving Apollo 17 through a 210 foot dish antenna at Goldstone, Calif. GOLDSTONE1AOS, Goldstone.
|PAO|We've acquired signal, but we're still waiting for a good solid lockup. And, our data shows that Apollo 17 has an altitude now of 335 miles above the lunar surface.
|CAPCOM|America, this is Houston. We'd like the high gain, please.
|PAO|And, we're beginning to get a picture of the lunar surface.
|PAO|This view's from 40 0 miles up.
|SC|Houston, do you read America?
|CAPCOM|Affirmative, America. And, we have a picture. Ove r .
|SC|Roger, Houston. America has found some fair winds and following seas, and we're on our way home.
|CAPCOM|Okay, chat's great news.
|SC|It sure is, Gordo.
|SC|You be"cha, by golly. It's outstandingly good. That was a good burn, too. We'll give you the burn report in a bit.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, Houston, I'll try to give you what Tsiolkovsky saw about the nadir.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 17:44 GET 236:52 MC900/2
236:52:00|PAO|The crater Tsiolkovsky on the lunar far side is normally not visible from Earth. First seen by a Soviet Luna, an unmanned photographic mission.
|SC|There you go.
|PAO|That crater's about 160 miles in diameter.
|SC|This if; a grand place to be right now.
|CAPCOM|I'll bet it is, and we've got a great picture of Tsiolkovsky. Got it right in the center, and good focus, great picture.
|SC|I know there's not as many smiling faces down there as there are up here, but we're making up for the difference in numbers.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|America 500 miles above the Moon now.
|SC|Gordo, i'll give you a quick burn report. The burn was on time. Burn time was 2 minutes and 23 seconds. Delta VGX was 30470. Attitude at the end of the burn was 184005359. That's 184005 and 359. There was no trim. The residuals are minus 2 plus .7 — correction, minus .2 plus .7, and plus .2. Delta VC was minus 18.1.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we got those.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 237:01 CST 17:54 MC901/1
237:01:00|SC|And Gordy, the unbalance is about 30 pounds, and oxidizer is 2.8 and fuel 2.9, and I drew full decrease the whole b urn .
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|How'd the picture look, Gordy?
|CAPCOM|Real fine.
|PAO|This view looking back across the lunar far side at the highlands.
|SC|I'd tell you exactly what we're looking at, but I can't see it.
|SC|Gordy, the country Gene's pointing out is south of the orbit that we've been following for several days, and Ron, even more than Gene and I. And it's some of the striking country of the far side of the Moon that human beings don't very often have a chance to see, but a trend's been started in the last few years, and I suspect it will continue.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack.
|SC|Gordy, America performed superbly.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We need pari camera OPERATE now .
|SC|Thank you. Pan camera going to OPERATE.
|CAPCOM|And can you verify that you got the other SIM bay items that preceed that?
|SC|We're verifying that right now.
|PAO|The spacecraft panoramic and mapping cameras are both operating at this time to record this view of the lunar far side.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. The SIM bay should be squared away .
|CAPCOM|Okay. Thank you.
|SC|Mark our fullness there. Gordy, I'll try and take you across that terminator if I can.
|CAPCOM|Allright.
|SC|We're seeing country south of Tsiolkovsky that we've never seen before.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And when we get a picture of Tsiolkovsky back, I think maybe even you can see one of the things that both Ron and I have noticed about it. Number 1, it's a basin that is comparable in it's freshness and apparent age to the probably the Imbrium basin on the near side of the Moon, and secondly, it has an unusual area in it's northeast quadrant that, from which, the blanket is excluded. There is an apparent slide, we're not sure what it is, but the normal indications of an ejecta blanket are just not there.
|CAPCOM|Roger, that Jack and we can see those features you just described. The camera, can you figure out a way to hold it a little steadier, that would help, but we're getting good resolution.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 237:01 CST 17:54 MC901/2
237:01:00|SC|Okay, Gordo, I'm working on it. You'd think a guy that's been there for however many days we've been there, could find it don't you?
|SC|When you see Tsiolkovsky south, the central peaks form an arrow that points south, Gordy. p A. 01If you look closely at the northeast rim of Tsiolkovsky, you' 11 see a large landslj.de that A1 Worden first described on Apollo 15. Crew now moving the camera, apparently to a different window. Apollo 17 now at an altitude of 825 nautical miles.
|CAPCOM|America,, Houston. Your altitude right now is 835 miles. Over.
|SC|Okay, 835 miles. And climbing out like a dingbat.
|PAO|North is now at the bottom of this picture.
|SC|Hey, Gordy, we're taking on mag Papa, Papa data altit ude.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|SC|There's Smythii down there. I finally figured out where we are. Right down underneath the window. I can see it now.
|SC|Gordy, as far as we can, we'll try to run you a little bit along the orbital track. I'll be panning the camera, more or less, westward. Tsiolkovsky starting and Tsiolkovsky is itself in the crater Fermi and moving on to the east, the next big pair of craters that we spent some time studying is Hilbert, which is just south, is right there, and just a little bit northwest of there is Pasteur.
|CAPCOM|Oh, Roger, Jack.
|SC|Both Hilbert and Pasteur appear to be very old basins, much older than Tsiolkovsky and they have, as you can see, a fill in them, apparent fill of very flat looking at this distance, and very light colored. It's an event on the Moon, of which we have a relative little understanding at this time, but possibly the Apollo 16 results, when they're fully known, with the analysis of the samples and other data, may shed some light on that event.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Sorry to interrupt, but we'd like pan camera OFF now. Pan camera on standby rather.
|SC|That's a full circle.
|SC|Okay, standby.
|SC|Now we're going to be able to pan a little bit more east now of Pasteur and start to show the crater Smythii, the basin Smythii really. It's one of the older large basins on the Moon. It has none of the obvious features of big basins, such as Imbrium or Serenitatis. But it's nevertheless roughly circular, has a mare fill, and a very, I'm pointing right now to the hint of a second ring outside, but the main ring; is the one Ron s talked to you a lot about and has his ...
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 18:04 CST 237:11 GET 902/1
237:11:00|SC|But see, the main ring is the one Ron's talked to you a lot about, and has this double ring craters in it. And we're pointing to some of those right now.
|SC|Ah h uh ,
|SC|Okay, Houston, we can now see Tycho. We're seeing probably about 75 to 80 percent of the entire Moon. Face, anyway lit up. The rings at Tycho are very obvious from here.
|SC|Want the camera over there, Gene?
|SC|Let me show it to him.
|CAPCOM|We had a good tour there of Smythii. We recognized the Smith Brothers, the Wright Brothers and started to see Neper before you left it.
|PAO|This view from the Moon at an altitude of more than 1000 miles.
|SC|Yeah
|SC|Ye ah.
|SC|No you won't to see Tycho fox a little bit.
|PAO|The large crater in the far right corner is the crater Humboldt.
|SC|You can - Langrenus is mow visible at the edge of Fecunditatis there, if you want: to show that one.
|SC|It's this side of Fecunditatis.
|SC|And Humboldt is a crater that ought to show up very well on television. That's the cracked floor crater there with a little dark mare.
|SC|Okay
|SC|There's all the swirls in Marginis. You can really see it now.
|SC|Oh, yeah. Why don't you get
|SC|Yeah. Certain swirls ---
|SC|Okay, early in our orbit, particularly Ron, he had the chance to work on the question of these light colored swirls and Marginis has outstanding examples of 'em and I'll try to get the camera pointed on those in the northern part of Marginis. Let me orient you, as soon as we're focused here. Okay, Smythii, I'll point right at the center of Mare Smythii, and then move up towards Neper and then into the swirl area a little bit more north. And Gene will zoom you in and let you see what some of that looks like. I don't think we have a full answer at what the swirls are, but some of the things that we saw in Taurus Littrow and later from orbit around Skulpicious Galois may suggest to people from now on that the possibility ox alteration from fluids in the interior of the Moon is more than just a possibility.
|CAPCOM|Roger. That's a nice snot there of Margini s.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 18:04 CST 237:11 GET 902/2
237:11:00|SC|Can you see the svirls, Gordy? Are the very diffused light colored areas that cross various topographic features?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative:, Jack. They're visible from here .
|SC|Okay. I'm going t:o give you an end on view, if I can, of Mare Crisium Basin. You should be seeing that now.
|CAPCOM|That's a good picture of Crisium as it is very evident on the right side of our picture.
|SC|Yeah, that's right.. And before long we'll be able to show the landing site and Taurus Littrow and I think you probably see Proclus which is the bright crater just off the horizon now. That's the one with the excluded ray zone on it's western south western side. It' not in view yet.
|SC|We may not see it, I think we're going the other way, right in the horizon.
|SC|The landing area, Taurus Littrow, and the edge of the Serenitatis Basin is probably just on the horizon now and I'm not sure it -
|SC|You can see the dark part of Serenitatis is sticking out of the Sea of Proclus the (garbled) zone. No that's Fecunditatis sticking up there, isn't it? Because the ray is perpendicular to our track now. Points right to the landing site right off o:i Proclus.
|SC|The area where one of the Russian vehicles set down and returned sample from is just about in the center of your field of view now. Just on the north side of Fe cundi t a tis .
|CAPCOM|Roger, and you're about 13oo miles up right now.
|SC|Wow. That's not a bad climb is it Gordy?
|CAPCOM|Pretty good rate.
|SC|A friend of mine says "Wow Woozle.
|SC|Looking out the window of window 3 now the Moon is just the size of the window and I've got my face right up against the window.
|SC|Or maybe his head's just the size of the Moon. We're not sure which.
|SC|(laugh -;er) That's right.
|SC|I don't: know what's happening down there now Gordy, but this is where the action was one time.
|SC|Okay, we're starting to, I think, in a little bit be able to show you the edge of the Serenitatis Basin. It's moving a little slowly right now. It look like it's creeping over the horizon.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 18:04 CST 237:11 GET 902/3
237:11:00|SC|It's going to creep over the horizon maybe but I think -
|SC|I'll tell you what's on the horizon now. I'm not sure I can get it. Let me try the rendezvous window. I think I can show 'em Apollo 11's landing site. You can probably get it in the south portion of Tranquillity there, if you - out the center window would be better.
|SC|Yeah, i:he center window you could get it.
|SC|See the southern part of Fecunditatis and then the Tranquillitatis takes off to the west there Gene right along that southern edge of Fecunditatis is where Apollo 11 set down.
|SC|Yeah, and a little bit north of the line of the ray of those two there.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, in the center of your picture is, about right in there, is the southern edge of Tranquillity and the Apollo 11 area and that was the ground track of course for Apollo 8 and Apollo 10.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Yeah, we'll put you back on Langrenus which is one of the Copernican age craters and it's part of the Moon and I believe it's Apollo 12 that had an excellent opportunity for several orbits to study Langrenus.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we see that. It stands out like a beacon there on the right side of the picture and we also saw Messier with its rays.
|SC|Okay, our landing site's in view now, see.
|SC|You're a little bit off the field - let me - almost out of the field unless we - Proclus, our landing area is just about in the center of your field of view right at the horizon now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|That's the best focus we've got Gene.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:14 GET 237:21 MC903/1
237:21:00|SC|Okay, full zoom, and right in that region in the center should be the landing site of Apollo 17. Known hereafter, I guess, as the Taurus-Littrow area.
|CAPCOM|You're now 1500 miles above the surface, and your climb rate was just computed at 295 000 feet per minute.
|SC|If I'd known that (laughter). That is really moving out. Sure glad they cleared the traffic out of the way. Let me -- Gene, let me switch over briefly and show them the North and South Poles, which nobody really has done much with yet, except lunar orbiters, and some of the Russian vehicles. There's a spectacular valley on the South Pole. I don't know the name. It looks like one of these long chain of -chain of craters. Did that show up? He tried it. Try some of these others. Well, oh, here's where it goes. Okay, Houston, we're in — Huh? Good picture? That's in the South Polar region. There's a — I think you can probably see a long chain of craters, which so far unvisited by man. In fact, the whole region has, and that goes for the North Pole.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. That's very interesting. Can you zoom in on that whole valley?
|SC|I think that's the best we got, Gordie. That's full zoom.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It's one of the biggest chater -- chain crater valleys that I've seen on the Moon. It — we saw some crossing Mindelaya in the first few days, I think we talked about. Similar in shape, but not nearly as big.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Let me move over briefly to give you another view of Humboldt which should show up very well now. We're just about directly overhead. It's unusual — one of the few craters on the Moon that have a fairly flooded floor, and appears to have been domed, and you probably can see some of the cracks in that floor .
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's in the center of the field now, however, something is blocking the right side of the view.
|SC|How's that?
|CAPCOM|That's real good now.
|SC|Around the edge of the dome floor, you can see some of the dark Mare which is prevalent elsewhere in the region but not so abundant in Humboldt.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And, you — you — you can see — if you can see — (garble) Oh, okay.
|SC|Out the window.
|SC|Oh, all right. Hey, there's another view, if you will bear with us, of our old friend Tsiolkovsky. Okay?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:14 GET 237:21 MC903/2
237:21:00|SC|Okay, I got it.
|CAPCOM|Roger. It's hard to mistake that one.
|SC|Yeah, it's one of the — one of the more picturesque basins, I guess partly, although it's big, it s not so big you can't look at it all at once. Smythii and Crisium and Serenitatis and Imbrium, in particular, are hard to look at all at once. You're always down inside of them in a 60-nautical-mile orbit.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Just might mention the diameter for those watching at home. That's about 180 miles across, I think.
|SC|(Laughter) That's pretty good. I was going to say about 200 kilometers, I think, is what it is, but 
|SC|That's rigbt.
|SC|And, Gcrdie, of course, it's on a part of the Moon that you -- you don't see frcm where you are.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Not yet, anyway.
|SC|Okay, let's see if we can move on along our orbital track that we've been following and see what's new that's come into view. Once again,' I'll pick you up at Smythii and move you into Mare Marginus, the Margin Sea. And, all the Mare, you may recall now, we have pretty good evidence as a result of the Apollo Program that our theories of basalt flows that some 3 to 4 billion years ago, in round numbers, were erupted on the Moon and filled many of the lower areas that existed at that time. Not an awful lot has happened to the Moon since — except for the impact craters, some of the youngers ones, since 3 billion years ago, which is one of the reasons it becomes so interesting to man. It's -- the Moon's frozen in a period of history 3 billion years and older, which is a period of history that we cannot recognize very readily on Earth because of the dynamic processes of mountain building and oceans and weathering that are taking place even at the present time. Understanding that early history of the Moon may mean an understanding of the early history of the Earth. And, I think we're well on our way to a first-order understanding of that history as a result of the program. Okay, going to take you a little bit farther along. Again, to Proclus, which is the obvious partially rayed crater with a big excluded zone to the southwest. There's Mare Fecunditatis and its contact area with the Sea of Serenity, Mare Serenitatis, and the landing site now has to be just about on the horizon. I think we were a little premature before.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Yeah, ve were. That's Microbus A and B just beyond Proclus there.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:14 GET 237:21 MC903/3
237:21:00|SC|Yeah, that's really Microbius —
|SC|Now, you're starting to just to see the Mare of Serenitatis come over the horizon.
|SC|Y eah.
|SC|And, if you take a line from Proclus between the two bright craters, —
|SC|You're not going to get more of the Moon unless we have space up here.
|SC|Yeah, yeah. How's that?
|SC|That1s better.
|SC|Take that line, and that will take you just about to the landing area, right at the edge of the next big mare that you see.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack, we can tell them that just as you told us there. Those three craters are very obvious.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:23 GET 237:30 904/1
237:30:00|SC|The site Gordo is now just to the left and a little below center of your picture.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And again you can see that ridge of mountains that sticks out and the landing site is - well from here right in that area.
|SC|Right, I guess my line was a little bit north of where we actually should have pointed you. There some dark area just showing up around the edge of Serenitatis on the horizon. I think that will show in your picture as I remember some of these from Apollo 10 before. And, it's just this side of the dark area that uhe Taurus Littrow area sits, in the mountains there.
|CAPCOM|We think we have Miraldi in site now.
|SC|Yes, and you also (garble) Macrobius should be visible to you just to the south of the landing are a.
|CAPCOM|Macrobius is in the monitor still they should have it.
|SC|Jack, :1 think a good view you can see Senserinous now you can probably get a real good shot of the eleven site at (garble).
|SC|Yes, your right. There Sensurenous. It's awful big.
|CAPCOM|How big is it, Geneo?
|SC|Okay, north the seven border. (Laughter). The old Sensurenous is right in the middle of the screen.
|CAPCOM|We see it.
|SC|You've been there before.
|SC|Ri ght.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston, you just past 2000 miles.
|SC|2000 miles. We've got about a 95 percent full full in front of us. Not too far, matter of fact, I think the Apollo 16 landing area would be just about on the horizon to the south of Tranquillitatis. And back up to something that's dear and near to our hearts. You probably now can pick out the mountains the north and south massif if you really look closely.
|SC|(Garble) is in the monitor can they see that.
|SC|I can'-: even see the massifs with the naked eye, no .
|SC|See the dark area there next to -
|SC|I know where to look, but it's so hard to pick them out. But, your looking right at it. You've got it right just to the left center. It's just about perfect the landing site. There's a little dark area in that
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:23 GET 237:30 904/2
237:30:00|SC|peninsula mountains that sticks out and the site is just about right in that area.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene as you say we know where to look, but it's hard to confirm exactly the structure there.
|SC|Come on you guys I can even see the light mantle.
|SC|Extrapolation is the nature of our art.
|CAPCOM|I just saw a flash, Jack.
|SC|We think it's (laughter). I didn't hear them. Say again.
|CAPCOM|I just saw a flash.
|SC|(Laughter). I wish we could show you some of the color we see on the Moon this trip, but I think we're a little too far away from it. We'll see if we can (garble) back in (garble) from here.
|CAPCOM|(Garble) .
|SC|Well, I can show you a picture of the commander. He's fairly colorful.
|SC|That's probably what we're seeing, Gordie. I can't give you the bottoir halfs because I can't quite move around the post. here.
|CAPCOM|Geneo, we're getting a great picture (Garble) 80 percent of it.
|SC|You getting the whole movie? Okay, I think you can orient yourself with the big basins, Jacks been talking about. There's Crisium. You can see the landing site up in the - what is tc me the upper left hand corner of the picture, but you can pick it up by now I know. Get a better relationship. Your looking at the Langrenus down there that bright crater. You ought to be able to see Humboldt. Maybe Jack can give you the whole thing. He can give you the whole thing.
|SC|Yes, (garble). Ah, okay that's pretty good it's centered just about right in the center. It ought to fit your screen as we climb out. Just about tangential now .
|CAPCOM|That's perfect right where you got it.
|SC|Okay, we'll hold that for a minute. The terminator is going to cross of course: at the opposite side of the Moon from the big basin your looking at.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Geneo, what color does that mare look like to you.
|SC|What color does the mare look like to me f rom here?
|CAPCOM|Right.
|SC|Now I'm a commander do I have the right to change my mind? (Laughter).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:23 GET 237:30 904/3
237:30:00|CAPCOM|I gue ss so .
|SC|Tom, you know I aLways thought you could almost make it look whatever color you wanted to it's so subtle. But the mare - th2 mare to ms has got a grayish -a dark garyish mixed with a very subtle, tan. and that s what it looks like to me from here.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|This is the CMP. I agree with that.
|SC|The tan is sort of like a dusted tan in spots in and around and on the mare. I. said at the basic if I could pick out a chunk of that gray mare from here. I would pick out a very steel gray. A dull steel gray color, but if I just took a massive mare out I'd have to mix it with a subtle - very very subtle pastel tan.
|SC|That's perfect. You can see Tsiolkovsky now in the terminator down there. I think Jacks just about got the Moon centered perfect. You got Tsiolkovsky on one end and the big basins on the other end. How high are we Gordie.
|CAPCOM|Okay, your 2327 miles.
|SC|You know I think it worth noting while we're looking back at the entire Moon as we see it here and your seeing it there that America could be proud of the Apollo heritage it's left here. I know we in the program believe that it's really and truly been a heritage will prove itself to be one of mens most beneficial things that have happened to mankind in quite some time, although none of us can really predict the future. But I think everyone that has been part of this program has been taught of its accomplishments. I know we have. We're looking back at someplace, I think, we will use as a stepping stone to go beyond some day. And those ardent words. Its a faith I truly and dearly have. And, I think we will all see it in our lifetime not just as a nation, but as a world. I think the Apollo program not only has given us the first step to that sort of impossible dream, but has given us an opportunity to make the first step in bringing a world together as one unit so that we can make that step together. It's been a priviledge sharing the program that part of it that we've been in with as many people as we have and as many people as we can because I've often thought and I've often said before that anything that's worthwhile doing and doing well is certainly worthwhile sharing with others. This is history being made in our time while you and I are alive not a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago and it's sort of the real thing happening right now. You're living it not just us. We nope that your getting as much out of it not just feeling of pleasure and excitement but that of accomplishment: as we are,
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 237:41 CST 18:34 MC905/1
237:41:00|CAPCOM|Thank you, Gene. Speaking for the ground, as part of the Apollo Team, we second those thoughts, which you put very well.
|SC|Well, Gordy, it's not our accomplishment. It's the accomplishment of the nation. And I think the next set of accomplishments, apparently the accomplishments of mankind. Gordy, in, in that vein, I think a couple words, I'd like to, more or less, reiterate what I tried to say as we finished our third EVA and that was that the valley of Taurus Littrow and the orbit of the spaceship America, saw the completion of mankind's first steps, first evolutionary steps from the planet Earth Into the Universe. I think it's important that in doing so, he established a tradition of peace and freedom within the solar system. From that larger home now, we move to greet the future.
|SC|Hello Houston and America and the World, this is the Command Module Pilot of the spaceship America and I just feel quite honored and proud to have been a part of this Apollo Program. The Moon, itself, is a magnificent, I hate to use the word dynamic, not dynamic, but it's a marvelous planet. It has all the wonderful opportunity for exploration. Man must explore. We will continue to explore and I hope that some day we may all have the opportunity to see mankind enjoy the benefits of the exploration of the Apollo Pro gram.
|CAPCOM|Thank you very much for the great TV show and the, and your final words. I enjoyed every bit of it.
|SC|And Gordy, with that, we're about behind our timeline as we fully expected we might be at this point and time, but believe me it has been a beginning, it is a beginning, I don't think there ever will be an end, not as long as man is alive and w illing.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. we'didn't have data, of course, while you had the TV on. We're wondering if you configured the SIM bay on our voice call or had you done it earlier? Over.
|SC|No, Gordy. We were late. When you called, I guess pan camera ON, we went back and configured a SIM bay and followed those steps in the Flight Plan. That followed TV ON. We had not done that.
|CAPCOM|Okay. No problem. We're just, just wondered what we had there.
|SC|Okay, are we up t:o date on the SIM bay now. you set a final?
|CAPCOM|Well, we're just now getting some data, and taking a look. We'll let you know. Okay, we'll take pan camera OFF now.
|SC|Okay, the pan camera power is OFF.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 237:41 CST 18:34 MC905/2
237:41:00|SC|Okay, Gordy. S-band AUX TV is going to science.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordy, it's going to be hard to leave this attitude, but we'll get the maneuver now.
|CAPCOM|Roger.-
|SC|And Houston, America. Mag Delta Delta is empty now. The last 50 per cent was used for taking pictures of the TEI.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron.
|SC|Gordo, going back at that burn. It was an outstanding burn. We were looking about a half a G throughout the burn. She lit off on time. She was a very steady burn. I think she reversed roll a couple of times at the deadband. The computer and the EMS were with each other all the way. Chamber pressure on Bank A started out at about 87. Bank B brought it up to about 92 or 93. And when I first sat down, it was reading 0, now it's reading 5.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We got 6 down here.
|SC|Okay, so in all other respects, the burn was nominal, Gordy. You got the burn report and residuals and we'll leave the tracking to you.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I might add, 1 don't think they built spacecraft any better than they built these two.
|CAPCOM|I don't see how they could have.
|SC|I'll sure second that.
|SC|I finally found what I was looking for. I got the man in the Moon.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|For all you non-believers, I verify he really is th ere.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordy, these next series of maneuvers bring us, bring our middle (garble) to the apo. We're watching it, but appreciate your not hesitating giving us & call, too.
|CAPCOM|Oky, doke.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 18:43 CST 237:50 GET 906/1
237:50:00|SC|Gordo, in answer no PP's question about the color of the maria down there when you look at Serenitatis, of course we saw this earlier, when we were much closer, but when you look at it from up here it's got on the northeast side, a very - quite thick laterally across the surface, dark - typically dark with the tannish colors I was talking about - mare - which sort of borders it, but just north of the overlap between Tranquillity and Serenitatis that contact changes sharply to a - the grays are gone - it's a very sharp contrast and 1 think those who have seen it before will remember it, but Serenitatis from where we stand is much more tan dominated than gray dominated.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Gordo. I'll get those numbers out of the first state vector out of the computer here shortly, no hurry to do it though.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Do you have our altitude now? About 4000 miles maybe.
|CAPCOM|I lost that display. Let me check it.
|SC|No, I'm just trying to relate it to when we were coming in. I'd say it's more like 5.
|CAPCOM|3100. *
|SC|How many ?
|CAPCOM|3100.
|SC|3100. Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Sorry to say that the LCIU has pretty well cropped evidently. We were talking over the biomed schedule and suggest that your choice either Gene stay on it or Jack go on it and then we'll get back to the flight plan rotation after the EVA. Over.
|SC|Okay, I'll stay on it through the EVA. How's th a t ?
|CAPCOM|Okay, fine.
|SC|And we'll pick up Jack in the morning.
|CAPCOM|All right.
|SC|Gordy, this is Jack. I failed to see the correlation between the LCRU crumping and me going on biomed. Don't tell me you were monitoring it on the surgeon's conso1e there.
|CAPCOM|Well, we'don't see any correlaon either but we're trying to look for some.
|SC|Okay, let me know when you have an answer.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Houston, America, when you get a hack on our track, I'd like to get a first good estimate at it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 18:43 CST 237:50 GET 906/2
237:50:00|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll do.
|CAPCOM|Do you know ±tfil take about an hour to get a good hack1Take about that much tracking. However, earlier the retro1was betting everybody there wouldn't be any mid-courses.
|SC|That's a good way to feel. Okay, we'll talk to you in an1hour about it.
|SC|Whose the wild men Retro? I don't want to play poker with him.
|CAPCOM|(garbled) Ha's a former B-17 pilot. Always right oil.
|SC|Now you're starting to scare me.
|SC|You ce.n pass the word to Captain Green back there on the1Tidings, "Clear tne. flight decks".
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll do it.
|SC|The ls.st time I had anything to do with a bomber pilot, Gordy, was scheduling my airplane.

|SC|America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|'We got: PTC orientation in the computer.
|CAPCOM|Negative. But we got it ready to come to you if you give us ACCEPT.
|SC|Ro g .
|CAPCOM|Okay. It's all yours.
|SC|Ro ger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:55 GET 238:02 MC907/1
238:02:00|PAO|The significance of Capcom Gordon Fuller ton's comment to the crew a few minutes ago that the LCRU had "crumped", as he put it, is that we're no longer able to get television from the lunar surface. The television picture comes back through the Lunar Communications Relay Unit. The Instrumentation and Communications; Officer here has tried numerous times to command the TV on, and the commands are not getting through. So, apparently, the TV is no longer available to us.
|SC|Gordie, (garble) on the way back the only planet that really has much weather visible will be a little repetitive.
|CAPCOM|Uh, Jack, we're heartbroken.
|SC|For your for — first report, you can just play the recording back. It's sunny and clear.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|You're right on that one —
|SC|The only time we need a weather --
|CAPCOM|-- except that you left out the fact that it's cold also here*
|SC|Gordie, you didn't listen. I can't see the Earth. I'm talking about that other planet.
|CAPCOM|Okay, depending on what part you're look ing at, it's cold there, too. We got you though. You got your REFSMMAT, you can go back —
|SC|There night be traces of an atmosphere.
|SC|Okay, Gordie, we're in block, and I might give my CMP one more chance; at a P52.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Then, the LMP gets to start trying.
|PAO|P52 refers to the rather tricky job of aligning the stable platform, does require a fair amount of practice, and Gene Cernan threatening to take over the job, of course facetiously, if Ron Evans didn't get a good P52 on his first try. This is the stable platform used as a — as an attitude reference by the spacecraft guidance and navigation system.
|PAO|By virtue of the fact that the television is not available to us, we were not able to see the third of the explosive charges fz.red. The seismic data indicates that that charge was fired very close to the planned time at 237 hours 49 minutes 52 seconds. That would be just a little more than 2 minutes early, and we're getting good seismic data on it in the Control Center at this time.
|SC|Gordie, I can look back and with the glasses — the binoculars, and I can see the white mantle and see all the Massifs in the landing area.
|CAPCOM|How about that?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:55 GET 238:02 MC907/2
238:02:00|CAPCOM|Back whsn you had the tube on it, I1I really think -- I knew we ware looking in the right spot, but it was just blurry enough tnat you couldn't be sure of exactly what you were looking at.
|SC|Gordie, let me -- since I don t have anything else to do right now, apparently, I'll see -- tell you a couple of things I see right here. The annulus — the dark annulus around Serenitatis does not look complete in -- in the new north area. Oh, there're little partial pieces of dark material up there, but the main part of the annulus seems to cross into the Mare region that's north of Serenitatis, and I can t remember the name of that right now. But, it very clearly crosses right over there as a band and then dies out in that north re gion.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Houston. There's the torque and an gle .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy.
|SC|Okay, and I'll torque it -- it looks like, it s at 23810. Guess you really don't care, though, do you?
|SC|And, orce again, albedo wise and hue color hue wise, the -- that: annulus is the same as at Tranquility, and essentially the same as most of Fecunditatis. The areas although Tranquility and Fecunditatis are mottled (garble) with tan colors, that mottling seems to be local and, probably in large part, related to rays that cross those -- those seas.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|At this viewing angle, the dark mantle around Taurus-Littrow area is just: a darker shade of blue-grey to me of the annulus, more just a medium grey, I guess, whereas the Sulpicius Galois dark mantle is a brown-grey, quite distinct m Its color hue — to me, at any rate.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Houston, I can't see any stars out there, so I'm going to (garble) instead of (garble).
|CAPCOM|Okay. gQ1Hopefully, the reason 1 can is because cannot, is because the Earth is right in the field of view, and it's still pretty bright.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|America, we've got a little musical selection for you here. Stand by. Recording of Dean Martin singing Going Back to Houston".
|SC|That's very appropriate. I remember tnat being played one other time after a TEI burn.
|CAPCOM|Rog 1 think it came the other direction that time, didn't it?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 18:55 GET 238:02 MC907/3
238:02:00|SC|if you stand by, we'll express to you our sentiments here with a short little tune I think you will enjoy. 
|CAPCOM|Okay, standing by. Recording of "God Bless America".
|CAPCOM|Hey, thank you very much. Very enjoyable and also very appropriate.
|SC|It certainly has a twofold meaning for us.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 19:13 GET 238:20 908/1
238:20:00|SC|That's about par for the CMP now.
|CAPCOM|Ho hum another all balls.
|SC|(Laughter) you hit it right on the money.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've got those.
|SC|Okay, and we torque at 2 382 3 .
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|PAO|Ron Evans last comment referred to the platform alinement he just performed the so called P52 which came out perfectly no error at all. And, of course, he was referring back to the commander Gene Cernans previous remark that if the P52 did not go properly he would take on the job himself. This, of course, is a task that the command module pilot is most proficient at and has done the most training and preparing for.
|SC|Gordo, I'll maneuver in about 10 minutes.
|CAPCOM|Okay fine.
|SC|Hey Houston America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Ron.
|SC|You reckon you'd have one of the photograph down there to figure out when we could get a full Moon with an 80 millimeter lens.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll put them to work on it.
|SC|Okay, appreciate it.
|SC|Houston,17.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack.
|SC|On the pan camera you said to expect to see barber pole when we ran it. I did not see that just for your information. It went barber pole then gray.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|SC|And Gordie several times I have reminded myself to tell you guys something and I keep forgetting. I think it was yesterday when we'did an oxygen purge on fuel cell three after about oh I think it was a minute possibly a minute and a half. The high 02 flow warning was triggered. Normally, I did not trigger when we'do the purge,, That's the one and only time it's happened. This last one prior to TEI there was within the green band and there was no fuel fell caution and warning. Just thought you might be interested in that one.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Jack thank you.
|SC|Houston Ron here I think I got that on fuel cell 3 too in one of my fuel cell purges when I was up here by myself. Probably shows up on the data anyhow.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And you can tell Farouk that crater out on Fecunditatis that I've got a picture of that we worked on back at the cape and studied quite a bit has got all the atquibets of everything he told me about It.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 19:13 GET 238:20 908/2
238:20:00|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Yes, and that's the; one - that's the one I was describing on this morning.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Also, be advised the inner ring of the basin Arabia is quite visible. It looks like there is a shallow depression outside the inner ring and when you get up at this altitude right around Sanger it is indeed it looks like a raised up plateau crossing Sanger. And, also in the vicinity of King - King is almost going into the terminator now. Well, it's 10 or 15 degrees from the terminator. But, you can see a little bit of a raised plateau that takes in the crater King and goes about a crater a King crater a diameter and a half or maybe two diameters to the south, and a crater and a half to the north of King.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 238:43 CST 19:36 MC909/1
238:43:00|SC|You know, Houston, it's also interesting to note the range of color from this altitude and from 60 miles doesn't seem to change at all, really. In other words, the same impressions that I had of color in the 60 mile orbit are the same impressions that I have now of the same areas.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's interesting. You're a little over 5000 miles out at the moment.
|SC|Roger.
|SC|Gordy, you don't have that number on this millimeter camera, do you. We're going to maneuver and I'd like to get a last shot at it.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Well, you're far beyond the point where you can cover the whole Moon with an 80. We were just trying to come up with an altitude for filling up the 250, but you'll get the Moon and then some with the 80 right now.
|SC|Okay. That's good. Then we'll take it with the 80.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. At 240:30, you'll be about 10 000 miles out, at which altitude, the Moon will just fill up the 250 lens field of view.
|SC|Oh, okay, 240:30, it looks like for the 250 lens .
|CAPCOM|Right.
|SC|Gordy, are you ready for an OMNI or you want to wait a little bit.
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. Gordon's off the console for the moment. We'll wait a couple of minutes on the OMNI.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We need OMNI Delta.
|SC|Okay, you've got OMNI Delta.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 239 hours 15 minutes. It's been very quiet, both here in the Control Center and onboard America. The crew, at this time, appears to be on the nominal flight plan, and they should be in the midst of an exercise period at this time. Also, they have the scientific instrument module bay in the Service Module of the spacecraft pointed toward Earth, with the ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers gathering their first data on Earth from lunar distance. The crew is scheduled to begin it's sleep period about 3 hours from now, at 242 hours 20 minutes Ground Elapse Time. And at the present time, we show Apollo 17 6782 nautical miles from the Moon with a velocity of 4537 feet per second.

|SC|Looking at our sketches here and trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at in the dark part of the Earth, I guess it's you and if it's a clear night you ought to have a pretty full Moon looking back at you.
|CAPCOM|That's right we'do. In fact it's nice and clear all day and I could see it as I came in this afternoon. Your subspacecraft point right now is over the Yucatan Peninsula.-
|SC|Yeah, it's just about the chart I'm looking at, Gordy. Looks1like about the right smack in the center.
|SC|Gordy, do you have a general trend on the prediction in1the recovery area.
|CAPCOM|I haven't heard one, but I'll see if we can get one.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. The sun is just about to enter the lens of the mapping camera and we'd like you to retract it and then close the cover. We're now copying SIM bay data now so we'd like you to get a mark on both the stata retraction — get a mark on the stata retraction and one when barber pole goes gray.
|SC|Okay. We're going to retract the mapping camera. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, mark it. There barber pole. And that was at 22 30.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we want: to keep it running to run the film out,
|SC|Okay, understand.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston., how is the mapping camera talk-back look?
|SC|Barber pole.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We thoughl: it should have been gray by now.
|SC|(laughter) Okay, let's see. I've got coming up on14 minutes.
|CAPCOM|That's what I've got.
|SC|Hey, there we go. Great.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|SC|Took awhile, but it made It.
|SC|Okay, the cover has gone closed, barber pole, gray.
|CAPCOM|Okay, thank you.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Got a couple of answers for you here. On the 02 National Warning Indication on the purge, the time you were pulling 37.8 amps out of chill cell 3 because the SIM bay was fired up, and that 11 result in about a flow of 1.37 amounts per hour which — and the triple of it is 1.2 so that's where you got the flag on it and you can expect to get the cussion warning any time you've got 33 amps or more being pulled out of the fuel cells at the time you -surge.

|CAPCOM|Go ahead and give us OMNI Charlie, please while you're talking.
|CAPCOM|We'd like H2 tank 1 fan off.
|SC|Go ahead. H2 tank 1 fan is OFF.
|CAPCOM|Thank you and go ahead. s C1Okay, we got all three of them off now. Right Go r dy ?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Hello Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Hello, go ahead Jack.
|SC|Okay, since I can't help you out on the weather right now in the1Pacific. Can you give me a run down of what things look like out there? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't on the loose. Apparently you already briefed somebody on that.
|CAPCOM|I covered the Recovery area. Not the rest of the Pacific. Did you want an overall briefing.
|SC|No. I was just curious what the Recovery area looked like, and I'm sure that my compatriots will clue me in on it, if I'm nice to them. CAP com1Yes. I'll save them the trouble. It s going to be 2000 scattered, 10 miles, 3 foot waves, barely above 10 knots. And less than 10 per cent chance of rain showers. And that s just about what the weather is now, and also forecast.
|SC|Okay. Thank you very much.
|CAPCOM|Jack, you've got a lot of SIM bay data stored up there, that we'd like to get dumped. Can you give us a high gain, pitch 30 yaw 320?
|SC|Okay, pitch 30, yaw 32 0. Okay, it s the old high gain for you.
|SC|Gordy, what altitude are we at now?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, I'll check. 8500 miles.
|SC|You clipped. Say again.
|CAPCOM|85 0 0 miles.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Gordy, as we're maneuvering, I guess we got one of the most spectacular views of the Moon I've ever seen, from a position like1this. It's like, just short of being 100 per cent full. We can1still see from Tsiolkovsky all the way across the Moon and it's just1absolutely magnificent and I'm afraid we're talking here, that the pictures just won't capture the real three-dimensional picture we're1looking at. But, uniquely with the binocs I can still see the Light1Mantle and the landing area.
|CAPCOM|Rog, Gene.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 20:59 GET 240:06 MC912/1
240:06:00|SC|Hev, Gordie, I don't know whether your camera people have anything to do this evening, but I've got a little problem for them if they'd like to work on it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|SC|Well, it seems to :me that we're not only moving away from the Moon, but we're moving across the face, and I took a picture about 5 minutes ago of the Moon, and it seems to me we could take another one at some X number of minutes and have pretty good stereo if we matched the printing of the two pictures in terms of scale. And, I'm wondering what* s a good time elapse here for a good stereo of the whole globe?1f
|CAPCOM|Okay, we understand the problem, but I m not — well, we'll try.-
|SC|Well, I guess, if you could figure out what it would -- how far we have to move across the face of the Moon and how long that would take to get about a oh, shoot, a 30 to 1 base height impression — oddly enough, 20 to 1 would probably be better, but at 30 to 1. you could still see the stereo. And, you ought to be able to figure that problem out. How fast — do the guys know how fast we're moving across the face of the Moon?-
|CAPCOM|I' 11 put that one to FIDO. Just looking at the big chart up here, I'm sure that the rate is slowing down rapidly, and -- because you're -- the farther you get away, of course, the straighter away from it you re going. Stand by, I'll see what we can do.
|CAPCOM|Jack, this is Houston with kind of a crude answer to your question.
|SC|Go ah e ad.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it turns out right now that you're not moving across the lunar surface very fast, and you're it's getting less and less — right now, I guess about a mile per minute. It would take a lot of minutes to get much of a stereo base since you're 1C 000 miles out. But, remembering back to Ron's final picture there before you went to the UV attitude, after he asked the question about how high he had to be to fill up the 80 millimeter lens, I think he took one at that time. We're thinking of combining a picture now with that picture, and then enlarging the one to get it to the equivalent diameter. And, some rough calculations of ^ your longitude at that time and -- and now, show that you've changed about 21 degrees across the surface of the Moon between that picture and the present time, which comes out, if you take the average altitude between that time and now, to about a 25 to 1 stereo base, as best I can figure.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 20:59 GET 240:06 MC912/2
240:06:00|SC|Sounds good enough,, Gordie. We've got it — I got that one at 5 minutes. I mean at 240 on the hour, so that'll be probably pretty close.
|CAPCOM|I would guess, you know, that the angle of looking at it and other factors have changed so much that it would be pretty hard to pull them together once you -- even though you get the images reduced to the same size, but it might be interesting to try.
|SC|I agree.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Houston. There's some items coming here now in the flight plan. A couple of them mapping camera retract and cover closed, you've already done. However, right now we still see the mapping camera film rolling, so we want to leave it running until we give you a cue to turn it off and get all the film run out. And, the uplink for a state vector that's shown there will not be necessary. Over.
|SC|We were looking forwards to doing something. Now, we'll wait a little bit longer.
|SC|Couldn't you just, flash a couple of lights on the DSKY just to keep us occupied?
|CAPCOM|Put in the crew alert or something.
|SC|Have to throw it in once in awhile just to keep us on our toes.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 21:23 GET 240:30 913/1
240:30:00|CAPCOM|The surgeon had a suggestion. He said if you really get bored you could all put on your biomed h arne sses.
|SC|Only listen to about half of what goes down will you.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 240 hours 42 min utes. Apollo 17 now 10 438 nautical miles from the Moon and coining up in about oh in the next 10 to 15 minutes -
|SC|(garble) goingintoPTC.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. As an additional Geneo go ahead as per flight plan with the one exception we'll give you a que when to stop the mapping camera as soon as the film r uns out.
|SC|Okay, we'll hold up on the mapping camera and it's cover and we'll get the IR off.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Gordi the IR is coining off now, mark.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|PAO|The crew is getting ready at this time to set up the spacecraft in the passive thermal control mode. This is the mode used to maintain proper thermal equilibrium during the translunar transearth coast phases of the mission. Rotating spacecraft about it's longitudinal axis set about three revolutions per hour exposing each side equally to the S un and cold.
|SC|Any updated briefing on the status of the lunar surface equipment and SIM bay findings over and above what we've got I guess. I can't remember what it was - yesterday or sometime.
|CAPCOM|I can't think of anything really outstanding we're just right now coming up on another charge detination; however, I think I mentioned that the LCRU is coput. So, we won't be able to watch it. We're looking at the seismometer traces here. I'll come back with any other words to update you on yesterdays report in a little bit here.
|SC|Okay, just update us if something news come in or something is all (garble).
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, Gordie we're going to maneuver now.
|CAPCOM|Alrighty.
|PAO|This is Apollo control. We're expecting the fourth of the seismic charges one of the lunar seismic profiling experiments to detinate on the lunar surface. The nominal time for the charge to go off is 240 hours 52 minutes. And it's been our experience with the previous three charges that their tending to go with in about five minutes either
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 CST 21:23 GET 240:30 913/2
240:30:00|PAO|side of that targeted time. So, we would expect to see my seismic activity in the next oh 5 to 7 minutes. And as we mentioned previously, the television camera on the lunar Rover is not available to us. Instrumentation and communications engineer at the previous detination attempted to bring up the camera sent a number of commands and the lunar communications relay unit which transmits the television signal to Earth did not respond to the commands. We never got a picture from the camera and we're assuming that the communications relay unit and camera system on the lunar rover are out of operation. we'don't at this point know what it is that has failed.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 21:44 CST 240:51 GET 914/1
240:51:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. You've just run out of mapping camera film. You can go ahead and clean up the items at 2 40 30 to power down the mapping camera.
|SC|Roger.
|PAO|And it appears that our 4th seismic charge on the lunar surface has detonated. Very close to the planned time we copied the seismic activity at 2 40 53.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I think it should already be in with the cover down.
|SC|Yeah, you're right.
|CAPCOM|And just: now the charge exploded at Taurus Littrow on the west sea and the results are on the trace rs here.
|SC|Which or.e was it Gordy? Do you know?
|CAPCOM|Okay, it: was number 8. A quarter pound charge and I guess it was 4th - I'm not: sure which location that was. It was four-tenths of a mile from the LCRU , if that helps you decide.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We'd like H2 tank 1 fan ON please. Don't get it up for - prior to the sleep period,
|SC|Okay, tank 1 is ON.
|CAPCOM|Thank ycu.
|SC|And Gordo, the canister is changed.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|They - Houston, are; GO on
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, Gordo. As a result of number five today and a little bit of a feeling of a little bit of gas right now with the possibility of a desire, I feel that it may be worthwhile for me to take a lomotil pill and I'd like to get your concurrence on that:.
|CAPCOM|Okay, standby.
|SC|Houston, America. How are our rings 1ook in g ?
|CAPCOM|Standby.
|SC|They are not down there yet. You want to wait a little bit.
|SC|Okeydoke:.
|CAPCOM|America to Houston, with a response to Ron's question. Over.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, fcr gas we're recommending only - we're definitely not recommending the lomotil pill we're recommending the gas pills; however, we also don't recommend the lomotils for a situation that really hasn't developed yet. If you want to discuss it in more detail we can set up a quadralope or go ahead as you wish.. Shall we?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 21:44 CST 240:51 GET 914/2
240:51:00|SC|Standby a minute.
|SC|Hey, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Yeah, we'd like to talk to you further, please.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Fine.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 241 hours 18 minutes. We are going tc configure the network for a private conversation between the Flight Surgeon, Dr. John Seig1schmid, and Ron Evans and we'll have a summary of the content of the private discussion as soon as possible afterwards. Evans had reported a few minutes ago that it had been a slight bit of gas. He requested permission to take a lomotii which is one of the pills in the medical kit which slows down intestinal activity. The Surgeon recommended for gas that a gas pill be taken. Lomctil will not be taken for a problem that has not developed, but if Ron would like to discuss the situation further we would set up a private conversation and the conversation has been requested and will be taking place shortly.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 241:20 CST 22:12 MC915/1
241:20:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 241 hours 53 minutes. A private conversation is in progress at this time, with Command Module Pilot Ron Evans. The conversation was initiated at Evans' request at about 241 hours 22 minutes. Evans had previously asked permission to take a Lomotil tablet for what he described as mild gas. The flight surgeon Dr. John Ze i,ge 1 s chmi 11 had recommended that a gas pill be taken instead, and we told Evans that if he wished to discuss the situation in more detail, we would set up a private conversation. Evans requested a private conversation and that has been in progress since shortly after 241:22. Participants are Dr. John ZeigeIschmitt, Dr. Willard Hawkins, Charles Lewis, the Flight Director, and spacecraft communicator, Gordon Fullerton. And we will have a summary of the conversation as soon as possible. This is Apollo Control at 241 hours 59 minutes. The private conversation with Command Module Pilot Ron Evans has concluded.
|CAPCOM|Now the start to roll for PTC.
|SC|Okay. She's GO, Gordo.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|Hello, this is Apollo Control. That private conversation ended at about 241 hours 59 minutes, and again we will have a summary, as soon as possible. At the present time, we're in the process of getting the spacecraft set up for the passive thermal control mode rotating it about the longitudinal axis and we'll be going through the pre-sleep checklist, getting the crew set up to begin their sleep period, as close as possible to the Flight Plan time .
|CAPCOM|OFF, 3 AUTO.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, we got 1 OFF and 3 AUTO.
|CAPCOM|Thank you1.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 242:03 CST 22:56 MC916/1
242:03:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Over.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|On that PTC startup, there was only one jet that fired, and so we only got half the rate we need, so I guess the only way to recover is to stop the roll and start damping the rates in the other way and wait for our call to start it again. Over again. Over.
|SC|Roger, again.
|CAPCOM|And we'd like the procedure on GA-2 using B-2 and D-2 for the spinup. Two jets.
|SC|Yes. That's interesting. B-2 and D-2 are both on.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we understand that Ron. Let us look into that a little further here, then.
|SC|That's right. P-l at DOP 1 at Bravo 2 are ON.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's what did it.
|SC|Delta 1 and Bravo 2 is what it called for and that's what was on.
|SC|Yeah, that was the wrong ones though, that's the problem.
|CAPCOM|Well, we're reading it both in the checklist and flight plan, Bravo 2 and Delta 2 are the ones to use for s pinup.
|SC|Yeah, you're right:. Okay. We got - we're reading the wrong ones, I guess. Okay, Gordy, is this a good atitude or should we go back to the UV/PTC (garbled) attitude?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. G and C is on that loop here. Just a second. America, Houston. You need to go back to the pitch and yaw in the flight: plan, and the present roll will be okay .
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Also for this damping we want you to go to the jetts call out at 2 40 50 in the flight: plan. That's a - you got it there.
|SC|Okay, ve got it here. Okay, give us a call when we get all mapped out there. We got Alfa and Bravo for damping jets.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hey man, we got the wrong ones here. We'll get back to that. What's in the flight plan at that.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I would think you're firing into the SIM bay range with the present configuration.
|SC|You're right. Hello, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Gordo, how's it looking for a midcourse 5? Any further word?
|CAPCOM|The last information was still a half a foot. Or essentially no midcourse. I'm not sure if we've been affected by the TGC here or not, the single jet spinup but we'll let you know.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/16/72 GET 242:03 CST 22:56 MC916/2
242:03:00|SC|Okay, fine. Don't worry about it. You won't have a final word on it until tomorrow anyway.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. I doubt if we'll have any - enough tracking before bedtime to give you any update tonight .
|SC|Okay, no problem.
|CAPCOM|Now, we'd like you to configure the high gain for us. We'd like pitch minus 40 and yaw 90 on the dials and then go directly from AUTO to REACQ.
|SC|Okay, say again.
|CAPCOM|Okay, pitch is minus 40 and yaw plus 90.
|SC|Okay, minus 40 and a plus 90.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|And REACQ.
|CAPCOM|That's affirm.
|SC|We have REACQ and NARROW. REACQ and NARROW now.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Over.
|SC|Go ah eai.
|CAPCOM|Okay, this SIM bay jett configuration, just isn't hacking the job of damping the rates. We're going to go to adjacent quads to try to get it dampened quicker. We'd like you to enable Charlie and Delta. To do that just disable all Alfa and Bravo jetts, enable all Delta jetts and also Charlie 3. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordo let me disable all Alfa and B ravo first.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Geno, and then enable all Delta plus Charlie 3-
|SC|Okay, yau don't want Charlie 4 enabled? Or do you?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. But it is already.
|SC|Okay, we're - yeah, here's what I got, I got - I got Delta 1 and Delta 2 on PD roll. I've got Charlie 3 and Charlie 4 for pitch and I've got Delta 3 and Delta 4 for y aw.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that sounds exactly right.

|CAPCOM|Okay, for Ron only, no Seconal tonight.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, G&C, with its years of experience, thinks that this PTC is going to hold - looking good so far, and1so I think its safe to go ahead and configure to go to sleep there if you wish.

Participants will be the flight director from the previous shift, Charles Lewis and the Flight Surgeon, Dr. John Zieglschmid. There was a private conversation with the Command Module, Ronald Evans, between 241 hours 22 minutes and 241 hours 59 minutes. The private conversation was initiated at Evans' request after he had ask permission to take a Lomotil, a medication to reduce gastrointestinal activity. Participants in the private conversation were Dr. Royce Hawkins, DR. John Zieglschmid, Flight Director Charles Lewis, and CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton. Evans said he had had a continuation of a gas problem, mentioned previously by all 3 crewmen. Both Evans and Gene Cernan said their main concern was for tomorrow's EVA. Dr. Hawkins and Dr. Zieglschmid recommended Evans take 2 lomotil tablets tonight and 2 more after breakfast to reduce gastrointestinal activity. They recommended that he take a semethocone tablet after meals for gas. They also recommended changes in Evans' breakfast menu tomorrow. Asked if the other 2 crewmen had had problems similar to Evans, Cernan reported that he and Jack Schmitt had had persistant gas which the crew felt was agrivated by hydrogen dissolved in the water used for rehydrating foods on board the spacecraft. The crew reported the gas caused occasional discomfort, but that there was no serious problem such as nausea or pain. Dr. Hawkins said he was confident the medication and dietary changes recommended for Evans would preclude any problem for tomorrow's EVA. The news conference should begin approxilately 5 or 6 minutes. We've had no further communications with the crew since saying goodnight to them about an hour ago.

|SC|Very good Bob, outstanding. We'll go along with whatever you want.
|CAPCOM|You guys are getting easy.
|SC|No, we get more likable as the days go on.
|SC|Good morning, Houston. This is the Command Module Pilot of the Spaceship America and we're up and ready to participate in another day's activities.
|CAPCOM|All right, got you there, Ron. And we're ready to participate with you also.
|SC|(Laughter) Okay, Rcbert. It was cold up here last night,
|CAPCOM|Well, I'll tell you, it was 27 at Ellington at 6 o'clock down here too.
|SC|Well, it's not quite that cold in here but there sure is a difference. And, Bob, how's America looking to you down there?
|CAPCOM|You're looking pretty good. We found nothing over night to give us any concern and we see nothing at the present time. Looks great. We're showing you at 56 degrees in the cab in.
|SC|Yes sir. We're going to get it warmed up here though starting shortly.
|CAPCOM|Okay, America still looks good to us.
|CAPCOM|And, America you're now in the Earth control. You passed about 2 minutes ago.
|SC|What was our velocity going through the change over in influence?

250:28:00|CAPCOM|Stand by.
|CAPCOM|And, Geno, you had 3851 feet per second going through the cross-over.
|SC|Okay, we're looking back at a very full and very bright, very beautiful Moon, right now. And the Man in the Moon is smiling as he's waving us on home.
|CAPCOM|Copy that. We had a good picture of him last night down here at Houston, also.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 07:36 GET 250:43 MC-926/1
250:43:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Over.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we lost you there with an antenna change. That we'didn't catch but we're back with you again.
|SC|Yeah, we noticed that.
|SC|Hey, Bob. What time does the old back room get up this morning?
|CAPCOM|Which back room?
|SC|The geology back room, of course.
|CAPCOM|Well, beats me. I don't know if there's anyone down there or not. Let me see - I'll find out.
|SC|No, that's all right Bob. I just want you to pass on a thought. I had a little trouble getting to sleep last night. And they've probably all ready thought of it. But, it has to do with Van Serg.
|CAPCOM|Go, ahead. I'll copy it down.
|SC|No, just ask them, if they've thought about the possibility that the -- those Van Serg breccias might be might be the old indurated regolith over the subfloor.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I got that,
|SC|That's an alternative that in the heat of battle did not occur to me at the time. It should have and it may have occurred to some of them.
|CAPCOM|Okay. That as opposed as being a window thru - to below the subfloor, which is what you suggested the o the r ni gh t.
|SC|Yes sir. I think I - I think I'd like the regolith better it I think makes sense from a lot of points of view, the size of the crazer, the fact that we should have expected to see something, but hadn't up to that time.
|CAPCOM|Okay. I got that.
|SC|And the breccias were, thinking back on it, could very easily have been soil breccias and just getting coarser as you got closer to the base of the sub - to the top of the subfloor, which is what we were looking at down in the bottom of the crater.
|CAPCOM|Okay, got that.
|SC|Bob, is your EECOM friend going to let us practice the waste-water-dump again today?
|CAPCOM|I kind of expect so. Stand by and let me find out for sure. Roger, Jack. There's one coming up at 252:0, about 2 hours from now.
|SC|Okay, we'll start reviewing that one. We'll be ready for him this time.
|CAPCOM|We won't let you sneak behind the Moon on this one.
|SC|Very good.

|CAPCOM|I'll tell you - you can - you can - use 3 - About the only1thing I can think of, Jack, would be 302. Jack, you might use 302 if1you want to. It's about the only thing we can think of.
|SC|(Laughter) Yeah, you get the idea.
|SC|Anyway, It's cold.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|It's not really that bad, Bob, but we're hearing a lot about it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well, we'll work it out here if we can try.
|SC|Well, yau might discuss it with SPAN.
|CAPCOM|We are, believe me.

251:35:00|CAPCOM|America, 17. Let's say it again. America, this is Houston. 2c1Are you sure? Would you like to try again ?
|CAPCOM|Well, that's all right Jack. We 11 live with it for awhile. We're looking at an unedict - Now we're looking at your temperature problem and there's a couple of obvious things I'm sure you've undertaken but if you haven't - all the window shades off. Get some sun light in there and might crank on all the lights to get some more heat load in there. Also the — first, the cabin fan and the temperature - cabin temp control thumb wheel is your option on that. The other things like mixing valve adjustment and powering up other items we're looking at very seriously but we would like to not do those items until after the EVA this morning. We'd like to remain the status quo on the ECS system with the exception of you do have the cabin fans on your option there. But we would like to retain the rest of it status quo until after the EVA.
|SC|Well, thank you for all your researching there, Bob. I'll let the commander make the decision. It -it's his thermostat.
|CAPCOM|Rog1t
|SC|The CMP feels pretty good so - I 11 see if they can give me a bath this morning. That will warm things up. Temperature's on the way up.

|CAPCOM|Okay, we start today's newscast out with this Historical Fact, today marks the b9th Aniversary of Man's first flight in a Heavier than air powered machine. Back on December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright, of Dayton, Ohio, took 3 Historic flights on the sand beaches at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The brothers will be honored today at a ceremony at avisitor's center near the flying site. Now, a look at the news. There's apparently been a serious hitch in the Peace Talks between the U.S. and North Vietnam. Dr. Henry Kissenger, in a curt news conference at tne White House, has said, that the North Vietnamese have rsneged on an earlier agreement and have brought out - brought the Peace Talks to a halt. Dr. Kissinger said, the unresolved problems which center around the number of Peace Supervisors and their placement is not acceptable to the President, and Kissenger feels, and we quote, "We have not yet reachea an agreement that the President considers just and fair."

In the congressional spotlifht in Washington it appears that the contest for the position of House Majority Leader will be between Representative Thomas O'Nea.. of Massachusetts and Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida, who will vie for the post left vacant by the absent and presumed death of Congressman Hale Boggs. Boggs disappeared in the crash of a light plane in Alaska, in October. Northeastern Ohio has been blasted by a blizzard. As much as 28 inches of snow has fallen, blocking highways and closing airports. An additional foot is expected - was expected before it was to move east. Cleveland has been very hard hit with the white stuff. And, the snow is now moving into the northeast. They'll all have a white Christmas up chat way. Here in Clear Lake, it's a clear—crispy day. But, a chilly Sun day Morning. Ellington had a 27 this morning. Might take a look at sports here. Miami defeated Baltimore yesterday 16 to 0, to go undefeated in the American Football Conference of the NFL.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. The UV cover appears on our telemetry to still be open. Would you cycle it and see if we can get it closed, or just give us what your onboard talkback looks like.
|SC|Okay, Bob. I got it - I only got it to the intermediate position.
|CAPCOM|Roger, thank you.
|CAPCOM|Okay. In a real hair-raiser at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, John Brody came off the bench late in the game, in fact, in the last 2 minutes of the 3rd quarter and led the 49'ers to a 20 to 17 win over the Minnesota Vikings. The win gives Western Division Drown to the 49'ers in the National Conference. His - the last touchdown thrown was with 5 seconds remaining in the game. That puts the Washington Redskins, Green Bay, San Francisco, and Dallas Cowboys in the NFC playoffs and closes out the NFC contest. In the American Conference, there's one key today to decide the winner of the Central Division. Pittsburgh plays San Diego, and Cleveland plays the New York Jets. Bsth Cleveland and Pittsburgh will get into the playoffs, but their position in the standing is now yet known. One will be the wild-card team, one will be the Conference - the Division winner. Miami and Oakland are the other teams In the American Conference playoffs. Cincinatti plays here at Houston. And we'll keep you posted on that one.

|SC|Okay, we'll start the waste water d ump1,
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. We'd like AUTO on the high-gain.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I don t think l ever updated your consumables and just a real quick update. You're above the line on all your oxygen tanks. You re above the flight plan line on all your hydrogen tanks or right on the line. And you're 3 percent above the line on the RCS - that's flight plan usage &t this time - so you re above the line on everything. gc1Okay, Houston. Thanks much.

|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|We haven't heard any reports from you on - and we're just kind of curious. Have you had a lot of condensation moisture around the cockpit?
|SC|Negative. It's been very dry.
|CAPCOM|Okay, real good. Well, just a reminder may not be applicable if you've got a good dry cockpit there. On 16 we had some rather strange readings on the evap out temperature and a few other ones. And the potential is there for you to get those same readings, especially if you have had moisture. The potentials is to get those readings after depress and we'll be watching it closely. I don't want to see you just ignoring them but we'll be watching them and take any readings for after depress there with a grain of salt. And while you're at it you might go down and zero the optics if you've got somebody in the LEB.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Stand by. We'll get that. Listen, the tunnel is dry up to the hatch. However when you put your hand up in the tunnel around the - the edge of the hatch and on the - on the outer periphery of the hatch itself there is quite a bit of moisture up there. We looked up there yesterday and couldn't find any but there is some up there today. And the face of the hatch is slightly moist but it's not-nothing like Lovell's.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'll we just want you to be aware that you may see some extraneous ECS readings. It's no problem at all but, you know, just wanted you to be aware of it.
|CAPCOM|Gene, the specific thing on 16 that occurred as we thought it out was - that the ECU control unit back of that panel there had the freezing - we think - freezing of the water on it, causing the bad readings1j
|SC|Okay. When we change the canister this morning, Ron tells me there was water back there, too1j
|CAPCOM|Okay. Well just - we can just expect some possible erroneous readings.
|SC|Optic to ZERO. G and N power is OFF.

|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 253 hours 16 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 16 coasting home now 167 091 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 3034 feet per second. Midcourse correction burn number 5, which is nominally scheduled at 253 hours 42 minutes ground elapsed time will not be performed in as much as the correction is less than a half foot per second required. Meanwhile, the spaceflight meterology group with the National Weather Service said this morning that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory for the landing and recovery of Apollo 17 on Tuesday. The weather forecast for the planned landing area, approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pago Pago, calls for partly cloudly skies, widely scattered rain showers, variable winds at 10 miles per hour, seas at 3 feet, and the temperature near 80 degrees. Still approximately 4 hours away from the transearth EVA in which command module pilot, Ron Evans will go hand over hand back to the SIM bay and retrieve film cassettes from the cameras and instruments in the SIM bay, pass them back into the command module for return home.

|CAPCOM|Roger. We are copying it, cabin temp around 70, is it a little more comfortable?
|SC|Well, we got two extremes.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, let's see now, the AM umbilical bag is on the Rock Boxes, on the LiOH cans now. What's next, Jack? Yeah.
|CAPCOM|America, we're showing -
|SC|(Garble) Go ahead..
|CAPCOM|We're showing a slightly high 02 flow, we're just wondering if all the waste compartment vents and all your dump vents are flowed as per the flight plan.
|SC|Well, ass a matter of fact, no. Overboard drain was opened - let's see, battery vents closed during the water dump and now it's to vent. Waste stowage vents now closed. We're thinking about opening our waste stowage vent anyhow to keep any possible breakage in there from coming back into the cabin, and that way it might go outside during the depress instead of inside. What do you all think of that?
|CAPCOM|Let us debate that one, it sounds pretty good but let us debate it.
|SC|Okay. Tom, the principle concern is those BUSS amples.
|CAPCOM|Rog. I under stand your concern. I - we'll work on it here, I don't th:Lnk there's any problem to it.
|SC|Okay, but all I'm saying is that the BUSS samples have never flown before. Yes, the EVA umbilical back (garble) Okay, they're up, up there, but let me make sure it's sitting down on the bottom this time. I didn't think of anything yet. Just hold it on that side. Okay, the 82 rock bag is; tied up. Yep. Okay, that 87 bag's all squared away. Okay, and let's see what we got this in (garble) at the bottom. Now a temporary storage bag is clear in the trunk. And we want to leave; them there and open the bottom. Are they tied up? Okay, here we go. Okay. Yeah, I'll have to (garble). Yep, LEVA are okay. Okay, we got everything we want in the jett bag now?

|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Some words concerning the waste manage ment vent, we really don't care what you do with it now until 20 minutes prior to your suit integrity check. We would like to have it closed for a good stabilized reading during suit integrity check and it requires to be closed 20 minutes prior to that time for stabilized flow. After the suit integrity check if you desire to open it during the cabin depress - that's okay with us.
|SC|Okay, we'll leave it closed now, and during cabin depress, we'll probably open it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, would you like us to remind you on it or just press on like you are doing?
|SC|Yes, that's affirm. We can use all the help we can get.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay. Okay, Jack you (garble)

|SC|Okay, and the EV gloves are on. Okay. Okay. For some reason, they're called (garble) boots up here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 11:01 GET 254:08 MC-937/1
254:08:00|SC|Okay. Tie down cables ready to go?
|SC|Okay. And the ah -
|SC|Okay, everything goes (garble), huh?
|SC|Okay, that bag is in there, EGRESS pads, tie down ropes and few clips.
|SC|Okay, (garble) SEP bag is in the EVA bag.
|SC|What'd we'do with that tissue dispenser, Gene? We1use it up?
|SC|Yeah, that one right there. Ah, ha. There's the old pressure gauge. And it reads 0.
|SC|Okay do the rest of them touch. Ah, this one redo.
|SC|Okay. Ah, ha, this one - Now.
|SC|(Laughter) I was just acting smart, I don't really know where they go.
|SC|That's a little (garble) that way.
|SC|They're not on yet.
|SC|(garble)
|SC|Gor it (garble).
|SC|Ah, yeah.
|SC|Hatch doors are stuck.
|SC|Okay,counter balance is all squared away.
|SC|Yes .
|SC|Okay.
|SC|(garble) What kind of lens?
|SC|Okay, (garble)
|SC|Let's use that other (garble) It goes on the pole with the (garble)
|SC|Well, we'll do (garble) on the pole first I guess.
|SC|A1 (garble) bag.
|SC|Oh, okay, I know what you mean. I've got to get A11so that's okay.
|SC|(garble) my jett bag is down there.
|SC|Okay, the old jett bag's on the inside now.
|SC|In my (garble) pocket.
|SC|Okay, (garble)
|SC|Okay .
|SC|It's out of here again.
|SC|No, it's -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 11:10 CST 254:17 GET MC938/1
254:17:00|SC|Okay, get that pump back (garble).
|SC|Here we go. Pick up the cable. Pick up the bonga. Well, go that way, I guess. Oh, okay. (garble). Here it is. There's the tape. Okay, what else do we need out of the - out of the hinge? Wondering. Yep. Yep. Yep. Package of towels. Oh, okay. Looks like we need a package of towels, don't it. And - to clean off the - all the stuff when we bring it back in, huh?1 Who - who's towel do we use? Do we use the commanders? Well, I'll use one of mine,. (laughter). Okay, here's the package of towels. Okay, you got a bunch of them. I'm going to need 3 or 4. Yeah. Well, yeah, you guys aren't but I still am. Yeah, okay. Well, I'm not ready to depressurize yet. Okay, that's A-l. Okay. The cable, the TV. (garble) first one (garble). But, they should be okay but (garble). Got one.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 11:21 GET 254:28 939/1
254:28:00|SC|Houston, in case you're wondering, we're still routing cables.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we've got you down in the check list, the step where just prior to S-band AUX TV to SCI. Do you concur on that?
|SC|Yes, we're still keeping TV and DAC cables (garble) up the pole.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we get you Ron.
|SC|(garble) Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Yes, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Is Gene in the Commander's seat at this ti me ?
|SC|That's affirm.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll delay then - a minute here, we're going to have a verb 49 maneuver coming up to you. We're getting the SIM bay a little bit cold, and we want to warm up those hand rails so we'll be maneuvering here at about 4 - at 254:45 I'll have a maneuver for you.
|SC|Okay, we're ready from now on any time.
|CAPCOM|Just stand by. We want to check out the numbers. I just wanted to give you the word that we were going to make this maneuver.
|SC|Any time, Bob, well, you're going to have to put on your helmet - it's really over that way a little bit. You got to get into the hatch to get it out.
|SC|Okay. Well, that's all taped up.
|SC|There's the old (garble) IV tether.
|SC|Ahah (garble)
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. I've got the V49 mane uve r.
|SC|Okay, go ahead with the numbers,
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's ROLL 150, PITCH 216, YAW 330, and we'd like that maneuver to start at 254:45. Just prior to starting that maneuver, we'd like the IR cover CLOSED and IR OFF.
|SC|Okay, at 24-45 you want 150 216 and 330, prior to maneuver, you want IR CLOSED and OFF and what about the jets on that Bob?
|CAPCOM|The same jets you have configured. Did you read ROLL 150, PITCH 216 and YAW 330. Is that what you read.
|SC|That's what I read and I'll stay in SIM bay jets.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you'll need these new high gain antenna angles. PITCH minus 32, YAW 52.
|SC|Okay, PITCH is minus 32 and YAW 52. Got i t .
|SC|Okay, then what. Okay. Okay. I'll get off the headset now then.
|SC|Okay, panel power OFF, suit power OFF and AUTO control normal. Got it?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 11:21 GET 254:28 939/2
254:28:00|SC|Control normal. Okay, panel 604, Geno is suit pressure alarm OFF, verify. Ball caps are 603, map CMP comm carrier cable from fuel to umbilical and we'll beep for you on it when you're -
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Ready. Okay, we're going to go ahead and close the IR and turn it off at this time.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Would you just close the IR and we'll cue you on the OFF call, we'd like to see that here and we'd like to do that as a cue.
|SC|Okay, it's OFF. Okay, we closed her - covers closed. Mark it. And it went gray.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we copy that.
|SC|Okay, route outboard of the strut and wires and connect CCU head to 603.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 11:36 GET 254:43 MC-940/1
254:43:00|CAPCOM|Geno, I'd like to give you just one bit of information, we just got from the simulator. When you go from this new attitude I just gave you, this VERB 49 attitude right now to the EVA attitude, you will see a middle gimbal angle of 66 degrees. That's right off the simulator.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Thank you very much.
|SC|Gravimeter in, Bob.
|SC|Okay, you got it connected? Be sure and cable the TV bracket, top of strut using 2 straps.
|SC|I kn ow,
|SC|Okay. Understand that. Serve cable and that's the same one the comm cable's to, TV bracket top of strut using 2 straps. You got that?
|SC|Okay. Let's see the - TV monitor. You got that? And ah - Connect PGA bag couch at 4 places, Ron. It's the old remove center couch bit.
|SC|Going to have to move the old jett bag, though. Back over to your side, I guess.
|SC|Yeah, Let's get this jett bag over on the other s ide.
|SC|You want to unhook the PGA bags.
|SC|I've got the top 2 .
|SC|Okay. Now, you can take the center couch down.
|SC|Yep.
|SC|(garble)
|SC|It certainly comes out easier doesn't it. You realize you're going to have to - aim it that way - That's right.
|SC|Gosh - this place is fuller than the mock ever was .
|SC|That's the old fuLl spacecraft story.
|SC|Well, Look what turned up here.
|SC|The clock.
|SC|Maps. Well they should be in R5 .
|SC|Wait a minute.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|Okay, (garble). Yep. Okay, close and lock your old marman clamps.
|SC|Closed and locked. Okay, open the old, the EVA umbilical bag.
|SC|Opened.
|SC|Unsnap the top strap and remove spacecraft down to EVA UMB all the way to the second tie-down strap.
|SC|And you're going to attach that to 603, but verify that the EVA Station 02 is off.
|SC|Attach the EVA umbilical to 603, move over at couch beam and under wires.
|CAPCOM|Jack, whenever it's convenient you might turn off the IR now, it's looking great.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 11:36 GET 254:43 MC-940/2
254:43:00|SC|Okay. The IR alarm switch is going to OFF. MARK .
|CAPCOM|Thank you sir.
|SC|Okay, you got the 02 locked.
|SC|Yep
|SC|(garble). Lock umbilical (garble) to couch ring lock and install pin. Got that. SCU open, bleed systemSCU closed.
|SC|Okay, .and you can close them if your system has let down. Unstow press gage to EVA bag and connect the gage to 603. And tape the the flash light to panel 603 guard g.
|SC|Okay. And install the gage?
|SC|Yeah, and then install the gage, tape the flash light, and then we can get rid of the tape. Got one? Leave the tape on that so the light won't gat out, Ron. (Laughter) Jerry Griffin told me that one.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17772 11:48 CST 254:55 GET MC941/1
254:55:00|SC|I want your tape. Did you stow the tape?
|SC|I stowed it right there in the temporary storage bag, ^op pocket. First valve stowed in EVA bag. First valve patch - pouch. And then the weight tethers, also. Oh doo doo doo doo - Weigh: tethers are in that bag.
|SC|Houston, do you have recommendation on whether we use 208 or 211 purge valve? You were very interested in that on the lunar surface. Here's yours -
|CAPCOM|Stand by. We're getting It.
|SC|Bob we're using my OPS, so I'm assuming it will be 208.
|CAPCOM|That sounds good, Gene.
|SC|Okay. Here's one tape. Throw it in the EVA bag in the proper pouch and then get the weight -both weight tethers out. And we can attach them up here to the guards. Yep, I'll get them. And we want one over on the other side. Where was the other one? Okay. Purge valve weight - and there's another weight tether in the EVA bag. Now, looks good. I'll put that up Oh, that's yours, I'm sorry, (laughter) I was looking for this one. All right. Yeah, that's the one. Not very far down. Numbers. Okay.
|SC|Okay Bob - We're at the attitude and high-gain is set and I never did see that middle gimbal angle get to 60. Let's go to CDR's LEVA and leave the EVA bags and LEVA bags. EVA glove.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene'o, it will be the next maneuver that you'll see that middle gimbal line going out around 60 - 66 degrees.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|But you're a magic little thing, there, (laughter) And particularly since your going to be looking into the Sun. (laughter) Hey, where? Kind of damp. Put the -put them in the pad TSB. No, not yet. That's VF - Yeah, that's part of the LOP LEVA and EV gloves. Put the gloves in the top pocket. Oh, they're in the left hand top pocket. You can wipe those off quite a bit with - They're not half bad now. I don't have any instructions. (garble).
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 11:59 GET 255:06 MC-942/1
255:06:00|SC|Okay. I think we can just stick these up in the couch.
|SC|Yep, ah -
|SC|Why don't you leave on the helmet? Okay LEVA bags are up in the tunnel. Then when you get to CDRs (garble) out 2 .
|SC|Houston, this is America. By my count we re still about 30 or 40 minutes ahead here.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. You're looking good.
|SC|Oh, I'm not to far. Can't tell from this, it's the next page. Huh? Yeah. (Garble) I wouldn t know if my helmet was fogged up or not.
|SC|Suppose to have put them in the left hand ah - Got a place for that (garble)? Somewhere I ceased to be careful with my helmet. I've (garble). (Humming)
|SC|Okay, have you got the CDR's helmet unstowed? Do I need gloves?
|SC|Put your helmet stowage bag over there yeah, (gable) accessary bag in the stowage bag. IV gloves in the temporary stowage bag. Okay, you got your helmet on. Verify that you're visors, verify the LEVA visors. Okay, and we antifogged. Okay. And the helmets and LEVA1s are under the CDR couch. Stow loose items, verify all your loose items, Gents.
|SC|Going to use it all.
|SC|Okay, let's verify that from now the cover's closed. Covers are closed. Panel 230, mapping camera, OFF. Sounder recorder is OFF, IR is OFF, self test. Just about. You can work in that direction now. You're happy with loose items and everything?
|SC|(garble)
|SC|Ah - CMP, first . (garble). Yeah, They've gotten it. Yeah, then me, and then you.
|SC|I'm just reading you the procedures, that's all.
|SC|Okay, Houston. For a little while things may sound a little bit confused. W're going to do the old thing about getting into suits.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We're copying that.
|SC|And if you don't hear from us - If you don't hear from us, off and on, well that's ah — because we re not talking to you.
|SC|And, Bob. The CDR's going off the loop right now. I'll be back in plenty of time for that maneuver.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And ah- let's see, continuing right here. Self test is OFF and the UV is off, and data says to On switch is to off, strange as that may sound. And - I can, yeah I will -I'll stay on for a while. Until Gene gets through (garble)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 11:59 GET 255:06 MC-942/2
255:06:00|SC|And the panel 5 instrumentation science (garble) D circuit breakers are coming open. 2 are open. Bob, you may wonder, what's that.
|SC|I already stowed mine in my temporary stowage bag.
|SC|That's it.

255:20:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Yes, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Did Ron unplug from the biomed for a whi1e ?
|SC|Yes, he is off the biomed for a while.
|CAPCOM|Okay, "hank you.
|SC|But you can look at me for a while.
|CAPCOM|Yes, you're there.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control, while the crew is suiting up, some spacecraft distance and velocity numbers. The current distance from the earth 163 130 nautical miles velocity 3131 feet per second. It's 255:30 and the crew is way ahead of the timeline in getting suited up and preparing for Ron Evans EVA. However, it is unlikely that they will begin EVA early. That remains to be seen of course. And at 255:30 this is Apollo Control.
|SC|Okay, Houston. Gene's got his suit on now, and he'll help Jack get into his.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron.
|SC|In case you're wondering, we changed the procedure there a little bit. It was more convenient to get those guys suited first and then me.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll buy that. You are still off of biomed. Do you concur on that?
|SC|Yes, if you want to take a look at it, I can plug it in here. I'm on Jacks headsets now, but I can plug it in if you want me to.
|CAPCOM|No problem - no problem - just wanted to - you know, it's easier to remind you now then it is to have you unzip the suit or something.
|SC|Oh, okay. Yes, I understand. Let me check and see if it's still working. I'll go off first and then back on.
|SC|Okay, it's hooked up now.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. You look good. You're breathing.
|SC|I'm breathing, huh. Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 255:34 CST 1227 MC-944/1
255:34:00|SC|Okay, Bob, CDR's suited and back on the comm an d b io med .
|CAPCOM|Okay, we copy that. gq1Houston, how do you read the LMP?
|CAPCOM|LMP, we read you loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, on that suit pan all is nice and calm n ow .
|CAPCOM|And be advised the CDR and LMP both look good on biomed.
|SC|Okay. And we're going to get the old CMP in the suit here.
|CAPCOM|Okay1.
|SC|That or we'll let him do It by himself since he's so proficient at it now.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We're tracking you as being somewhat ahead on your timeline, so don't rush on the - on the suit donning.
|SC|Roger. We're not rushing, just going at it systematically. We apparently learned how to do it, though, somewhere along the line.-
|CAPCOM|Okay, well, just want you to be advised we don't particularly want to start early and, therefore, you're ahead of the timeline right now. You can take a break afterwards maybe.
|SC|Okay, Eob, we're aware of that one.
|SC|I understand, Bob, I understand.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 12:47 GET 255:53 945/1
255:53:00|SC|Houston, this is the LMP. I've got some thing for you, you've been looking forward to. It's a number, it 1s 24173.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack
|CAPCOM|Jack, I wasn't sure what you were talking about there for a minute, but it lit up the face on the panel next to me. Everybody's happy now.
|SC|Good. I'm sorry about that, Bob. Tell them that it was not intentional to leave it in the suit. As a matter of fact, it might be worth a reminder when you think we're unsuiting to take it out.
|CAPCOM|Well, if you wouldn't mind a reminder, we wouldn't mind giving it to you.
|SC|Alrigh: with me.
|CAPCOM|We're writing it in to the EVA check list, right now.
|SC|Houston, we're on top of 3-8.
|CAPCOM|Roger, understand.
|SC|With the exception of the verb 49 man euver, the other pages are complete.
|CAPCOM|Roger, you read my mind on that one.
|SC|Say again?
|CAPCOM|You read my mind. That was the next thing I was going to ask you, I hadn't seen a verb 49 and that's on that page that isn't required at this time.
|SC|Yeah, right. We're standing by for your flight plan time, we'll maneuver in the flight plan verb 49.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we understand.
|SC|Okay, verify your SEU CLOSED. You ready to go ?
|SC|Panel 2, cyro press indicator is B, panel 603, EVA station 02 on. Verify EVA station 02 gauge reads approximately same as surge tank. Surge tank reads 850. I guess that's approximately. (laughter)
|SC|(garble)
|SC|Okay, SEU OPEN. Verify flow and purge umbilicals. And then the panel 603 EVA station 02 OFF.
|SC|02 OFF.
|SC|Okay, you verified all that. (Laughter) Weights - remove weights, belts storage, straps from umbilical and stow in EVA bag.
|SC|Okay, that's done.
|SC|Connect EVA umbilical electric panel to CMP PGA, right hand blue and lock. You're going to connect the EVA umbilical to yourself.
|SC|Okay, your electrical and 02 are con nected. Right hand blue and locked.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 12:47 GET 255:53 945/2
255:53:00|SC|I transfer the LEB, I didn't see that in here.
|SC|There it is.
|SC|Okay, your next big step here is to connect the waist1belt and lock - buckle on the left hand side.
|SC|Hey down there now, Ron, can I help you with the connections? You don't have to be going down there, you know until -
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 256:08 CST 1301 MC-946/1
256:08:00|SC|No.
|SC|Okay. Yep, that's good. You'd like it pointed down, right?
|SC|Yeah, that makes sense.
|SC|Now, is your belt under the scissor pocket?
|SC|Okay. We got our comm carriers on, so that's no problem. Gotta put your comm carrier on now.
|SC|And then we'do the comm check.
|SC|Hey, Houston, this is the old command module pilot back on the loop and how do you read?
|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, Ron, and biomed's clear.
|SC|Hey , okay .
|SC|Hey, some power at panel 10, Ron. Power audios, suit power's on, mode VOX.
|SC|Okay, we're in VOX. VOX in (garble) as required, approximately 7.
|SC|Well, if it works good at 9, I'll try it down here. I don't know where - Well, leave it all the way up. Leave it on 9. It works that way.

|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack, we see it.
|SC|Not much of a picture, I was looking right at the floor.
|CAPCOM|we'don't see the picture, but we saw the S-band.
|SC|Now look at the camera.
|SC|Oh, okay.
|SC|Yeah, yeah. (Laughter) Okay. Okay, I read you loud and clear.
|SC|Okay, yep.
|SC|Hey, we: 1 re going t: o have to move th Ls TV a little bit because I can't get the hatcg open.
|SC|Houston, I think you heard from the CMP and the LMP. Why don't you try the CDR arid see if he hears you.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I thought I already had a contact with Gene. CDR, how do you read Houston?
|SC|Still reading you loud and clear, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Roger, CDR.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 256:08 CST 1301 MC-946/2

|CAPCOM|Your choice on that, CDR, you're ahead of the timeline right now.
|SC|Yeah we're - we're going to press on slowly through the system, perhaps for Depress set and just to make sure we'don't run into any problems there, and we'll probably - probably call a pseudo hold before I take a check there, or take a look at it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Oh, okay. Yeah, let's go ahead. Okay, and there is that. (Laughter) I think I ought to hear that one. I guess I can pretend like hear it. Make sure I'm in audio tone, but I don't think it makes any difference. I don't hear a thing. Houston, any suggestions in the suit pressure alarm on?
|SC|And no tone.
|SC|I didn't hear a Houston. (Laughter)
|SC|Hello, Houston, America.
|SC|I hear you guys, though.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Just for your information, we've got the TV and we see the floor.
|SC|Okay, Robert, I just turned on the suit pressure alarm, and no tone. Seems like I should get a tone there. That right, J ack?
|SC|That's what he said - verified.
|SC|Hello, Houston, America. Did you get that last?
|CAPCOM|Roger, that's affirmative, and you should have gotten a tone, and we'll let you try it again. And we're thinking it through right now.
|SC|Nothing. (Laughter)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 13:12 CST 256:19 GET MC947/1
256:19:00|SC|LSC now.
|SC|Houston, you got a. circuit breaker or two we could check on that one?
|CAPCOM|Affirmative, and we'll be right with you with it.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you might go over on panel 5 and check the instrument SCI equipment hatch circuit breaker. That has to be in for the tone to work.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Okay, Houston. It's - the hatch circuit breaker is in and - couldn't be my head set at all, could it ?
|CAPCOM|I wouldn't think so. Not your head set per se since you're reading us and all.
|SC|Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too.
|SC|Say, Bob. How would it be if I just plugged into the comm cable on umbilical just to check out the entire suit — head set system here on that too?
|SC|You just cut out. (garble) here. Okay, see you after I go off the line for a minute.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you might verify that the non essential BUSS switch on panel 5 is on MAIN A.
|SC|It's an intermittent in my head set.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|That's verified that Ron thinks he has an intermittent1in his head set for some reason.
|CAPCOM|Ron, your transmissions are okay and you're not breaking1up to us. It may be in your head set.
|SC|Okay, Houston. Gene's able to hear the tone. Ron's getting it intermittently.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We copy.
|SC|How about switching head sets with one of you guys, huh?
|CAPCOM|If you decide to swap head sets we would prefer that you swap with the CDR.
|SC|Any special reason?
|SC|Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh this, oh, I see. I'll trade with Jack, here. Bob, this Is CDR, have you got any answer to the last question.
|CAPCOM|Roger, CDR. It's almost a toss up but we would like to have the other man out on with an absolute good head set, although we'don't think it s a real problem one way or another.
|SC|We'll get him out with a good head set. Okay .
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 13:12 CST 256:19 GET MC947/2
256:19:00|CAPCOM|It's a toss up - CDR take your pick, I guess, ove r.
|SC|Okay, stand by. We'll check one out here. Okay, we just made a swap. Okay, Ron is wearing Jack's head set and he's got a good talk continuing when the switch is on and he loses the talk when the switch goes off. We've got CMP and LP made the switch.
|CAPCOM|Oh, Roger.
|SC|Oh, that. I didn't - yeah - I didn't - I didn't even know you could cut it off. If I'd known that I'd cut it off before. Yeah. If I'd cut it off like that I'd have my curly locks hanging out the front.
|SC|Hey, Houston, this is the LMP. Give me a call,
|CAPCOM|LMP, Houston. Read you loud and clear. How me?
|SC|Okay, you're loud and clear.

256:30:00|SC|351, okay. The cabin repress valve, Okay., okay , I'll get it.
|SC|Okay. Cabin repress valve is OFF on 351. And verify closed.
|SC|Yeah, that's right. They're tickeling.
|SC|Okay, C2 heaters trim are in auto. Engine -
|SC|Yeah, that's a good number.
|SC|Okay. Got it. Yep, it's off.
|SC|Okay. You on or -
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI Delta, Omn i De 11 a.
|SC|You've got it. Yep, got it in there. Okay PCV is verified on. Okay. Yep.
|SC|If you decide to put this on later, you can put it on for me, but it flops all over the place down here. Okay. It's Red ECS 02 hose. Okay. Pull the old purge valve. Valve 2 OH. It cane from the Taurus-Littrow landing area of the Moon. Okay. Got purge valve. Boy. Okay, let's look at (garble). (Laughter) Okay, it's sloped, is it.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston, we are OMNI, Charlie.
|SC|Yeah, you can't see it.
|SC|You're OMNI Charlie now.
|CAPCOM|Thank you Jack.
|SC|(garble).
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|What's the matter - I'm going to try the other one, that thing I can't even move.
|SC|Ah. Sticks or something. Okay. Let me try the other one.
|SC|Yeah, this one's stuck here, stuck in some thing. Couldn't move that if I had to. Okay, we'll use 211 instead. Okay, Houston. He's going to wear purge valve 211, that's not perfectly matched but, I see no problems with it. It's a lot frecier.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America. And we anticipate no problems with using 211.
|SC|Okay. Fine Bob.
|SC|Okay, we want it low, you said, Jack. Okay .
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|Find, Dkay, it's low. Okay.

256:30:00|SC|Okay, like so.
|SC|Okay, CMP hoses are routed up across the tunnel and out of the way, we hope. Ah, ha, finally getting some flow. Man, feel1a lot better. Okay, cabin pressure's coming up. Okay. Jack, I guess you really could go to the LEB the LMP and he lp me ,1n ow .
|SC|Yeah, yeah, because I can -
|SC|Okay. I've got the flow coming in here, so, (garble) are up around 5.7.
|SC|Okay, just a second.

|CAPCOM|Roger, America, we copy attitude.
|SC|I'm getting all tangled up in the hose. I don't (garble)
|CAPCOM|Okay, America. We're ready for the high gain PITCH 43, YAW of 262.
|SC|Okay, in just a minute. Manual and wide PITCH of 43, YAW is 262, high gain. Okay, they want AUTO, n ow ?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Ron.
|SC|I started to go fiill scale, but - is that good enough?
|CAPCOM|Ron, we needed full scale.
|SC|Let me try it again, okay? I'll go to manual and wide -
|CAPCOM|React and wide and then step it down.
|SC|Okay. Ahah, it's working. Okay, you're reacq and narrow, now.
|SC|Okay. There it went off.
|CAPCOM|America, we see your cabin 5.4 and we'll keep an eye on it.
|SC|Okay, give us a little call there ahead of time and I'll correct it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Jack you're squared away.
|SC|Okay, Bob, I've got the proper jet con figured and AG PITCH and YAW main B axe open.
|CAPCOM|Roger, and we would like to go back to AUTO on the high gain, and see if it holds the signal strength for us.
|SC|Okay, you've got AUTO.
|SC|Okay, 3ob, I'll verify that all the head set switches are set as per 3-9.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America, thank you.
|CAPCOM|And America, your cabin press is at 5.6 and you can crack the side hatch valve if you like.
|SC|Okay. Get the old cabin pressure down here a little ways. That's about 5 isn't it?
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we're seeing 4.9 on your pressure, you can stop venting there.
|SC|Okay, we're stopped.
|SC|Okay, it's closed, (garble)
|SC|Okay. Here, Jack stick that up there.
|SC|Up left. Okay. That's right side up. Not yet, I haven't got them all on here.

256:43:00|CAPCOM|Gene, you probably realize that the audio tone is a separate wire all the way to the ear plug, and that's why there's no problem - the LMP's got no problem.
|SC|That's affirm, we understand.
|SC|Yes, we understand that.
|SC|Okay, Gene, the bottom ones looks like the letters up, right?

|CAPCOM|Understand the CMP does not have his tone again?
|SC|Ah, son of a buck.
|SC|Pretty good at this time.
|SC|Okay, I'm reading 3.9, should have low suit flow because I got the purge valve.
|SC|Okay, you got your EVA — pickup EVA 02 is on

|SC|60202? Yeah, it's on. 02 flow is on.
|SC|Okay, and you're reading 3740.

|SC|Purge valve is open to low.
|SC|Did you open it? I think I did.
|SC|I think I did.
|SC|Yeah, it was open.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|You're op en.

|SC|Okay, turned the tone off.
|SC|Okay, it's off.
|SC|Okay, how's your master volume? You happy with it? Or did you jack it up a little?
|SC|Houston, say something.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. We copy you. You might try and adjust your VOX -- thumb wheel down a little bit might help us a bit, knock out some of the background noise.
|SC|(Laughter) Okay. Jack, you want to try to (garble)1the VOX down a little bit?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 14:10 GET 257:17 MC952/3

|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Is that — that okay? Okay?
|SC|You're going to get a little bit of noise, I think.
|CAPCOM|Oh, that's affirmative. We realize that.
|SC|Okay, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Okay, Houston, unless we hear otherwise, without the tone at that point, we are pressing on.
|SC|Okay, Jack. On 351 get the emergency cabin pressure rates off.
|CAPCOM|America, that's affirmative, and we'd like to vent the cabin we're at 5.7 again1
|SC|Okay .

|SC|About 351.
|SC|Okay, Houston, I'm 351, emergency cabin pressure's off.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Okay, Ron. (Garble) Let me read this to you. Soon as your monitor comes in, set purge valve high, and verify tone on at 31 to 34. Then turn valve closed and verify tone off. Go ahead, turn the switch on.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|You probably didn't get a tone there because you were already on up to pressure by the time you got that switch on. I think that's why you didn't get a tone.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|So, you should get one here. So turn the tone — you got the tone power on?
|SC|No, not yet. I can't get down there.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Not unt:Lll you get Jack out of the way.
|SC|Okay.

|SC|Ron?
|SC|Okay. There's a 3.9 on the cuff guage.
|SC|Okay, we're going to do an integrity check on you. It's 603 EVA and Station 02 off.
|SC|Okay. Can you reach that gauge, or do you want me to?
|SC|Oh, I can get it. Get it if I turn around here. I'll get it. (Garble) Let me undo this before I pressurize, and I'll strap 'em in again.
|SC|How you guys doing?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 257:27 CST 14:20 MC953/1
257:27:00|SC|Oh, 11vs done it before. I must be lying in the way here.
|SC|I get it off?
|SC|Okay, got the tone.
|SC|Okay , n ow .
|SC|Okay, monitor cup gauge, verify PCV closes. Monitor pressure decay for 1 minute, verify lesser point 8.
|SC|Okay, closed and we're at 3.61.
|SC|Okay, when did you start your time?
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Can you guys hear that tone?
|SC|Yes, I can hear occasionally.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Oh, you can hear it on the ground, huh?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Ve ry good.
|SC|Okay, Ron, how is, how is your suit pressure?
|SC|Suit pressure is stuck at 3.6.
|SC|That's a good place for it to be. You have about 30 more seconds, don't you.
|SC|No. About 15 more.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, and you did get the tone on for low flow.
|SC|Yes.
|SC|Let me know when you're satisfied with the time.
|SC|Okay, turn it back on.
|SC|Okay. 0 2.
|SC|It's on and let me get this all the way up. Is it all the way up?
|SC|Yes. I think it is. I can see it increasing, and I'm getting ready to push it. Put your guards down.
|SC|See anything?
|SC|Okay. Okay.
|SC|Okay, you happy?
|SC|Yes 3.7 to 4.0 stable?
|SC|Stable 3.9.
|SC|No tone?
|SC|No tone,
|SC|EVA pressure gauge 100 to 500 psi.
|SC|Yes. For some reason, the battery is burned out in the flashlight. Let me see, it's about, I would say 400, I think. Yes, let's see, it's division marks on that gauge are 36 and 900. And it's above the 3 ...
|SC|Yes it's good, I can see that.
|SC|Yes, that's it. it's about 350. Okay, verify surge tank pressure. Houston, can you give us a hack on the surge tank as we go.
|CAPCOM|Stand by on that.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 257:27 CST 14:20 MC953/2
257:27:00|CAPCOM|Roger, it looks good.
|SC|Okay, very good. We're ready to press on with the cabin depress, Ron. GN-2 valve handle pulled.
|SC|Okay, we'll pick that up when he starts to move. Okay, gauge rain,1and leave it in that position. Pull the handle Leave it there1Okay, Verify helmet and gloves are locked.
|SC|Okay. Looks smooth. Here, I'' need to get that down .
|SC|Che ck.
|SC|You look, look, hey babe you looked good when you went by me1Just stay that way.
|SC|Will stay that way. Okay Hiuston, we're standing by for your Go.
|CAPCOM|You're Go.
|SC|Okay, Ron, here's a note.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|EVA warning tone may come on momentarily during the depress.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Jack, are you ready.
|SC|Okay, babe, when you get out there, just take it nice and slow1and easy. You got all day long.
|SC|Yes, that's right. Not like the zero-g airplane.
|SC|Feel yourself around,and it's nice and easy to get around, just1don't let your body start moving too fast down there.
|SC|Okay, side hatch coming open slowly.
|SC|Or the valve's rather.
|SC|I can't see the gauge, but I know we're coining down.
|SC|Okay. Houston, can you give me a hack at approaching 325.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. We will.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, that's 02 flow high as expected.
|SC|Okay. And that's oh, about 395?
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Coming down a little faster Houston.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're watching.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, when you get to the SIM bay, don't fool around ...
|CAPCOM|3. 4 Gene .
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|3 . 3 closing.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 257:27 CST 14:20 MC953/3
257:27:00|SC|Oh, okay, will do.
|SC|Get your feet in the golden shoes, and then you can do anything. But get them there first.
|SC|Okay, 3.25, 02 flow Indicator is off scale low. Okay, can you verify our suit pressure down there?
|CAPCOM|Rog. You're locked up suit pressure 2.8.
|SC|Okay, very good, We're coming all the way open. Going to zero. You guys ready. Here we go.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|I don't change. I'm already there.
|SC|Yes, but Jack and I are coming up.
|SC|Yes I know.
|SC|Okay, we're coming up.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Nice day for an EVA, Ron. Go and have a good time.
|SC|Yes. It ought to be pretty good out there.
|SC|Okay, we're coming off the peg.
|SC|I just need one visor down, don't I.
|SC|No, you need you Sun visor down, to bring, one is protective, and the other is the Sun.
|SC|It is?
|SC|Well, t looks dark out there. Can't even see.
|SC|Well, use your own judgement. If you're in the shade, you won't need them. If you're in the Sun, you ought to have it down.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, Jack. I'm at 2.8 and coming up.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Well let's open her up a little more.
|SC|Okay, the valve's all the way open. And I'm 3.5.
|SC|Okay, I'm still reading about 382 now.
|SC|02 flow high light is off. Wait until we're stable Ron and we'll be with you.
|SC|Jack, it looks like I'm peaking out, peaking out of a 3.75. How you looking.
|SC|Okay, 'Ron, you're 3.7 to 4.0.
|SC|Yes,I'm3-8.
|SC|Okay, EVA station pressure gauge stil1 up.

|SC|Okay, let go the old actuator handle.
|SC|And the hatch is yours.
|SC|Okay, here we go. 1, 2, 3, I got a hold of it. There's a bunch of trucks going out there, (laughter) Oh, there goes thepen. (laughter) Got that. That was a felt tip pen. (garbled) (laughter)
|SC|Say, Ron, now you want to actuator handle select lock to L.
|SC|Okay, wait a minute. Actuator handle to latch. Okay, she's started. (garbled) There it is, okay. There we go.
|SC|Okay, now it's closed. Okay, gearbox selector to latch

|SC|Okay, Rog, you got a -
|SC|The cresent Earth.
|SC|You've got a go for egress.
|SC|Be auti f ul.
|SC|Okay, and just take it slow.
|SC|Okay, first of all I got to get back and get the old TV camera. Ops. That's right I don't know where the sun is. Which way is the Sun? Okay, Sun's on the right.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 14:30 CST 257:37 GET 954/2
257:37:00|SC|Okay.
|SC|And Ron's putting the camera out there on the pole now. Pole out there rather.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We see the EVA light out there.
|SC|Stay lower.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|That Sun is bright. Whoooo.
|SC|Pull down that visor, Ron. You're going to need i t.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|Not the metal one, unless you really need it.
|SC|No I don1t want the metal one.
|SC|No just get the gold one. That's all you need.
|SC|Okay. Try this one.
|SC|Okay, you're clear back here.
|SC|Ah, man. We're about to get the old TV pole in there. Lined up. What's in there. Forgot to turn the camera on. Hand back the -
|SC|Sequence, here.
|SC|Let me get the (garbled)
|SC|You're a long way from home we'don't want to loose you.
|SC|Okay. I'll start the - I think I hear it buzzing. How's the TV picture, Houston?
|SC|Really great, Ron. Looks great.
|SC|Okay. Hey, I seewhat you were talking about Gene, on this blister. The band's really blistered on it. Like (garbled) That a good one? Okay.
|SC|If we're cleared to go down and get the old lunar sounder1cassette, huh?
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Okay. And I got my foot hooked to something. Which way1do I need to go?
|SC|There we go. Okay. How's that? Okay? Blowing?
|SC|Canlgonow?
|SC|Am I clear?
|SC|You're clear, Babe, go.
|SC|Okay. Hot diggety dogs.
|SC|Okay, did you see an E dot.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Am I on the tube?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Outstanding quality picture, Ron,
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 14:30 CST 257:37 GET 954/3
257:37:00|SC|See me wave?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|(laughter) Okay. Beautiful. Hey the paint on here is just a - silver paint, and it's just little blisters on it is all. You can just kinda peel it off with your fingers. Yeah, it rolled off the other way. I can see the Moon right behind me. Beautiful. The Moon is down here to the right. Full Moon. And off to the left just outside the hatch down here is the crescent Earth. Maybe I can get a picture of the Earth as I'm coming back in there. But the crescent Earth isnot like the crescent Moon. It's got kinda like horns and the horns go all the way around, but they make almost three-quarters of a circle. Hey, that last mapping camera retract must have worked because the door is closed and everything is closed up.
|CAPCOM|Say, Ron, you did get the camera? Right? The DAC on.
|SC|Yeah, Ken DAC's working -
|SC|Okay, you're go to transfer to SIM bay and get in the foot restraints.
|SC|Okay. Here's a piece of the thermal blanket from the sim bay jet. That of interest. They're just kinda laying there underneath the EVA handle.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we see it. Confirm.
|SC|Okay. But it's a pretty clean cut from the SIM bay itself. That's just a piece of that thermal blanket that's sticking around there. Man, it's black off this other way. The pan camera lens is all (garbled) (singing) Okay. (singing)
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 257:48 CST 14:41 MC955/1
257:48:00|SC|I almost had my foot in there, then the cable was between my foot ...
|SC|Get it.
|SC|Okay, I having a little trouble right now just torquing down to get my foot in the foot restraint, for some reason.
|SC|Yes.
|SC|No, not yet.
|SC|Okay. Okay, the right one's in. And the left one's in. Hey, pretty stable right here. Let go of both hands, see?
|CAPCOM|Roger. We see you waving.
|SC|Hey, this is great. Talking about being a space man, this is it. Okay, back to work. This is a little stiffer, I think, or something than normal. Okay, let's try to do a little (garble). Oh, the (garble) is still there. Okay, here's the (garble, garble) and there is goes. Okay, before we'do anything else here, I guess we better, better hook the old tether on the thing. Okay, tether is on. is this the end of that? Oh, okay. It's nice and white down here., the UV cover's closed real well, doesn't seem to be any (garble) at all on the white phase, on the UV or the IR. Everything is in good shape. Looks like part of that cork insulation tipped off again down here in the corner that I'm looking at. Okay, let's try the old cassettes. We'll push down on it until it goes past center. I think that was 2 pounds of push, but it came out. And cut the film. Okay, she's locked in there. These EVA handholds are, the EVA handholds are, okay got it free, are rougher than, (garble), oh, that was my pocket, and it creates a torque , when I let go of that pocket there, I let go with a little bit of a force, and the force has a tendency to throw your feet way up in the air.
|SC|Keep talking Ron. I'm walking that one with you.
|SC|Okay. Coming right back. Oh, my feet are bouncing up in the air again. Shouldn't be, yes, can you do it? Oh, I hope I don't hit the end of the (garble) again. Yes. See, you put yourself down there, and then you got to twist to stop, or, or it, (garble) and you bounce back up in the air again. Okay, there comes some of the paint. Oh, we'll get attached to "he thing on there, before I take mine off. Okay, comes the old cassette. Yes. That close enough Jack, or you want a little closer? Okay. Yes. Look for craters. Yes (garble, garble) that way. Okay, you got the old lunar sounder cassette.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, you're GO to get the pan camera.
|SC|Pan camera's next, huh?
|SC|Got a couple of hard covers don't forget.
|SC|Yes, there's a couple of covers on it.
|SC|You know, the old EVA (garble), I thought when I
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 257:48 CST 14:41 MC955/2
257:48:00|SC|was looking at that the other day, it depended on what kind of light you're in, it looked like it was burst a little bit. And sure enough it is. Okay, now let's see now, which way did I turn on this thing. Just go backwards down here. What the heck? Okay. Oh, how we need to get that big old pan camera. Oops. Okay, locked in there and you can relax a little bit. Let's see 02 pressure is, must be breathing a little bit, it's up to 40.
|SC|Houston, this is America. Everything is looking good from here.
|SC|Houston, this is, let's see when you're EVA, you use your name, don't they?
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Yes sir, we'll use it Ron.
|SC|Houston, this is Ron, okay?
|SC|You hear me okay, I guess, huh?
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. We read you loud and clear.
|SC|Okay. Oh, this is great, whoopee.
|CAPCOM|Yes, we thought it was Mr. America.
|SC|Well it is something like that. Oh boy, beauti ful Moon. Full Moon down there. Runs back of what. No you can't see anything. The only thing I can see is the SIM bay. I can see the engine valve sitting back here. That's a pretty good sized thing too and of course, the UV, the VHF antenna, it's still sticking up there all of the, all of the poles are on it, so it's working allright. Oh, it's a little bit of a (garble), just pull the old metal thing off here. Oh, (garble). Can you see that? The thing I'm holding up. It's the cover on the outside of the pan camera. It's a thermal cover, see it covers up the cassette. Ah.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 14:51 CST 257:58 GET 956/1
257:58:00|SC|I'm out in the shadows. There we go. Yeah. Say that's right. It's the thermal cover that's on there and then that's the
|CAPCOM|Roger, we see a lot.
|SC|Whoooooo. Okay. Well, let's see. Ohhh there's a pan camera cassette down there.
|CAPCOM|We just saw that covered.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|Okay. Let's see that hooked down. And lock it. (garbled) Okay, it's locked and won't come apart.
|SC|I say, where's the old pin. There it is.
|SC|Okay. Here's a bolt. Frees the handle. And out you come. I didn't even use the (garbled) the heavy son of a gun. Not heavy up here, it just has a lot of — momentum to it. Once it starts going in one direction, it takes a lot of force to stop it. And we'll just try and oops, there's a - rest of -it there we wouldn't want to do that. Let me get this thing fixed and then put up. I did. I think I'11 just kinda let this thing go and hang on with both hands. Get it started right In front of me. Have to look the best way to see that one. Okay. Just kinda floating around up there. Oh, Peter Pring, you okay?
|SC|And it's trying to come along with me, I just learned to do that. You she's just floating there. Okay. Coming. Still coming. Brought the bag behind me. That's good. Nice and slow. Cause you don't want that thing banging around to much up there I don't think. Ahhhh. There it is. (garbled) That's the way it ought to be done, isn't it? Okay, you going to watch. Yep. Okay. Got hooked on my French (garbled) my cuff guard. (laughter) Okay. That's a good idea. Boy, that Sun's bright when you look into it. That is a biggy. (singing) You know I just kinda looked along underneath me, you just go backwards down there. (singing) That's an unorthodox way to enter the SIM bay, but it works. Okay. We'll leave (garbled) up. Ah, okay. I'm going to rest when I get my feet in that thing. (garbled) right there and take it nice and easy. Yeah, once you get your feet in there it (garbled) - ya'll don't feel like may or might come out. (laughter) So, I'm not sure you really trust 'em. Ahhhh, the right foot (garbled) Yeah. Hello. Mom.
|CAPCOM|We see your act. Looking great.
|SC|Told ycu. Hi, John, and how are you doing? Hi, Jimmy. Let's see. I'm supposed to rest, aren't I? What would you like to know about the SIM bay? Looks great. (garbled) I was kinda surprised when I saw on this mapping camera there was two - oh, one just kind of a steel plate there, and right on top of the door, there's something with a piece of tape on it. And I thought that piece of tape came off before launch.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 14:51 CST 257:58 GET 956/2
257:58:00|CAPCOM|Ron, just a couple questions while you're standing there resting. Is there any damage to the cable that the mapping camera - the cable between the mapping camera and the shelf?
|SC|Let me check on that one.
|CAPCOM|Don't move and look at it. It was not that important. If you can see it fine. Otherwise forget it.
|SC|There. Okay. Oh, I'll kinda take a look at it when I go by. There's Jack. Hey, how are you doing? You're looking (garbled) and I'm looking right at you. I should have a camera and I could take your picture. And see the Moon back over there? Well, that's the way it goes. Ah. Man, it's clearer down here when you take that visor up. I hope I took the outside one. I mean the full one, Naw, that's both of them. Better leave it down. Ahhh, there we go. Yeah, you take the outside one up a little ways and then you can really see down into SIM bay. You know that tape down in here, it's not scorched one bit. The whole side of the spacecraft is scorched like a son of a gun. But the - you know the panels and everything. Man, there's bubbles on-all that silver paint that's out here - is, you know it used to be kind of a bright looking silver paint. It looks like, it's in a shadow right now, but it looks like it's just been heated up. Ah, one way or another. Yeah, that's up here between the SIM bay and the top of the service module it actually looks like it's been burned. You know. Not just a little bit warm it's just kinda firm because it's bubbled. Yeah. That's what (garbled) did from the LM I'm sure. And, but, as far as I can - it's kina dark down the other side of the spacecraft - the other side of the SIM bay, but it looks like the thrusters don't make any - hardly any mark on there. I'm looking at the side of quad 8 thruster, and it's all scorched. I'm not sure but what that might have been -what in the world would do that? Power jet suppose? I don't know. Might have. Well, let's take one of these covers off.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 15:01 GET 258:08 MC957/1
258:08:00|SC|Look. This is like you see it in practice. (Laughter) Stick it underneath the door. Looks like I m ^ jerking on it a little harder up here. In practice, I didn t want to break it. There's -- a part of the — could you see that one ?-
|CAPCOM|Roger, we see it. Looks like the outer space Olympics going on up there.
|SC|(Laughter) Hey, this is great, I 11 tell you. And, let's see which way it'll flip so you all can see i t down there. g C1That's good. That's real funny.
|SC|Okay. Look.
|CAPCOM|Rog. We see it reflecting off in the dis tance. S q1Did you see that one? Okay.
|CAPCOM|Never did that in the water tank.
|SC|(Laughter) Yeah. That's the little the Mylar. It's the tinfoil that they make the LM out of, you know?
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|(Laughter) No, not really. They also (garble) insulation (garble;)* And, here we go.
|SC|If that's what they made the LM out of, you'd never be able to pul- it apart, I 11 tell you.
|SC|(Laughter) That's right. I -- I'm joking about that, you know. I'm really joking. Fellows, it was a good vehicle.
|CAPCOM|We'll send your apologies to Bethpage.
|SC|And (laughter) — No, I guess Bethpage knows I m joking, you know. Let me see. Hey I want to make sure I get this on the right handle there, don't I? Gee, that's a lot of world to watch us, and I forgot the starter. (Laughter) Okay. Forty minutes, huh?
|CAPCOM|We've got you 35 minutes — 36 minutes, Ron .
|SC|Oh, okay. Oh. Okay. Yeah, the EVA light's kind of blistered, also. No, they're right behind, toward the Sun. Looks like there's hooks on there now. Hooks onto the cassette. No, maybe that tape's supposed to be on that pan camera, I'm sure. But, the old door's back in there real well. I don't know what -- what would cause that thing to --^ well, they weren't expecting those four minutes anyhow. Ohhhh, there s the old Mappers' cassette. Well I'm — supposed to pick it^ up aren't I. I want to take a look down in there. Uh, can t get out that way. (Laughter) Got a locked foot in there and you can't go out in the left direction with -- with my foot in there. You have to lean over to the right a little bit to get your foot out. (Singing to himself) Yeah, nice and clean down there. That cable's in the clear. I can see down in there. There doesn't seem to be anything hanging up on it at all.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 15:01 GET 258:08 MC957/2
258:08:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, good show.
|SC|Okay. Put the old foot binder down now. Woops , come back here, little cassette. (Singing to himself). I was going to try to lift that door up, but it's sort of got an angle on it, and it's stuck down in there anyway.
|CAPCOM|There's no requirement on that, Ron, no req ui rement.
|SC|(Laughter) Okay. Check one thing while I'm out here before I leave, to see the bottom of this Quad A. Forgot to look at it. Yeah, it looks just like the side almost. More blistered on the side than it is on the bottom, but I think maybe it's just the paint.
|SC|Okay, I'm coming back in.
|SC|No, I'll get it. Okay.
|SC|Boy the RTV is good out here. Looks brand new. Whatever they put on the hinge -- looks like that RTV stuff, huh? That's why they seal around all their doors on here. And, it's spanking clean as ever. (Singing to himself.) Okay, no hurry. Think. What's — ha, outstanding. Once you get stable, in a position, see, I can pretty much hang on with one hand, and I can twist — oops. Yeah, once you start going, its a son of a gun to try, it's all wrist action (garble). Yeah, but once you get stable on this thing, you kind of relax there and — yeah, you're through. And, if I ever banged my foot against something, just barely touch it, and it bangs right back. And, — Hey, America looks really great there. Still got that silver tape on it. Or is it blue? Looks silver with this helmet. Let's see, I've got to get over this way further this time, don't I? Okay. There we go. Hey, I got a picture of the waste water dump from the LM the other day, but it looks the same way now. There's all kinds of little ice particles all around the periphery of the dump nozzle itself. It covers up the kind of gold parts that's on the end of the dump nozzle. Then, there are little particles of frozen water, I guess. Must be. They're all over up the side of the spacecraft there, but only in the vicinity of the nozzle. It goes up just about to window Number 1 — it goes up to window Number 1 — well, maybe on up to — no, there's particles all the way up the side of the spacecraft-- clear up to the top of the tunnel. But, they're real fine. I want to see if there stuck on there. Hey, you just touch them, and they blow away. They're just little ice particles.
|SC|Okay, Houston. We got all three cassettes th i s side.

|SC|Says Ur.ited States , and it's got a United States flag right below it. That didn't even get scorched or a darn thing. That's great. And, let's see now, I see what Charlie Duke meant. Man, it's dark out here. It is really dark. The scimitar antenna, right there -no shake - no problem. Wish there were some more handles I'd go around the other side of the spacecraft. Take a look at the high gain. There aren't any more handles.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we'don't need any more Space craft commentary. We'd like you to go ahead and terminate the EVA. You're looking great. Everybody's really pleased and wo'd just like to go ahead and terminate.
|SC|Okay. Sounds good.
|SC|Okay, Bob, we'll get back in.
|SC|How's that?
|SC|Okay, I guess we'll - start getting back in then. Come up below the camera right now.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you'd be happy to know on the TV we got a great view of your OPS with the United States flag on it.
|SC|Hey, beautiful. Perfect.
|SC|Let's see, which way do I want to get the umbilical down there? Ah, the amateurs pulling me sidewise, Okay. That's right. There, okay. No, that's all right.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|No, that1s right. You are in good shape. Go ahead and start pulling in.
|SC|Wait a minute Ron. until we get Jack in the right place.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Where?
|SC|Yeah, pull up on that one.
|SC|Come on in.
|SC|Okay .
|SC|You coming in head down or up?
|SC|This way right now.
|SC|You can 1t close the hatch that way,
|SC|I kn ow i t.
|SC|Not yet..
|SC|What does that look like on the monitor?
|CAPCOM|Well, you should have - test me and I wouldn't want to guess. It's probably the full Moon, isn't it ? J
|SC|It is.
|CAPCOM|You taught me well Ron. Taught me well.
|SC|Okay, you got - (garbled)
|SC|Okay, and I'm going to arc it around and (garble) See if I can turn around here anyway. Yeah, I am. Trying to anyhow. (garbled) APOLLC 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 15:11 CST 258:18 GET 958/2

|SC|No,I'm not.
|SC|Yep. I'm afraid I can't get throught it - can't quite. Okay don't do that to much.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we know what you've been through and we appreciate the TV show that looking - started to be a go, but we'd like to terminate.
|SC|(laughter) We're terminate.
|SC|Yeah. We're terminating.
|CAPCOM|And you might be advised you're right on the flight plan, you're right on the flight plan.
|SC|Oh. Okay. Good. I didn't want to get - cut my time short any you know.
|SC|Ah, unless you can set it way back there. Okay, then I'll keep it right here.
|SC|Ah, sure Geno, we can shove it underneath your couch.
|SC|That's the best place to shove it.
|SC|Can you do that? I'll get up out of your way he re .
|SC|Kinda good. Let me get out from under the (garbled) Okay.
|SC|And, if you can get the TV switch there Jack, that kinda saves - all the time I guess.
|SC|If you can't, I'll get it when I come in .
|SC|Okay, and I got it off up here.
|SC|Okay, your in standby. That's all.
|SC|Okay. We'll have to come in there kinda a little bit blind because - in order to get in I got to look at the Sun. So just kinda point me in the right direction the re.

|SC|(laughter) I didn't see a thing.
|SC|You blew it. Let me get your umbilical.
|SC|The only thing I saw drop was the -
|SC|Say Jack,
|CAPCOM|Ron, Ren, how's the hatch? Get down on the hatch. Your OPS isn't getting through the top. Pull yourself down. Straight fcrward. Face down. Nose down. Now back.
|SC|Okay. How's that.
|SC|Now back. Keep coining. Keep coining. Now can you reach1the hatch?
|SC|Yeah, nakes sorta (garbled) Let me get back in a little bit.

|SC|Okay, give us the GO when it looks good, Houston.
|SC|Oh, yeah. See the hatch —
|CAPCOM|America, you're looking good. No (garble).
|SC|Okay, we're goingto go —
|SC|Okay, repress open and let it go to zero, Ron .
|SC|We'll end up with about 2 feet of (garble).
|SC|Can you see the gate?
|SC|We 1.1, wai t a minute .
|SC|(Garble) Uh, there we go. Okay, I can see - no that's temperature. Okay, here it is.
|SC|No, no. I mean the repress 02.
|SC|(garble)
|SC|(garble)
|SC|It's almost zero. Oh, you wanted the cabin pressure.
|SC|Now, repress 02,
|SC|It's about zero.
|SC|When you think of zero, you think —
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene, we got (garble) - we're indicating abot 2 csi down here at this time.
|SC|Okay, Ron. If it's zero, you can close repress 02 valve.
|SC|Okay, we'll close the repress 02. What the — Uh. Okay (garble).
|SC|We're going to let your (garble) rate.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|And you next move after we get a hack at 3 will be to disconnect your OPS hose and hold the correct (garble) on the cabin volume, and we'll get your OPS on.
|SC|Would you — would you believe I'll let you do that ?
|SC|Yes,I would.
|SC|Okay. Because you'll be (garble).
|SC|Yeah. Yeah, I'm almost down there now.
|SC|Say, Houston, I was surprised when I closed the hatch here. It came closed real well, up until about an inch from the (garble).
|SC|Can you see the (garble)?
|SC|No.
|CAPCOM|Ron, we'll (garble). I'll give you a call at 3.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 15:21 GET 258:28 MC959/3
258:28:00|SC|Oh, okay, mighty fine, Bob. I was going to say the — when you're closing the hatch, I expected it to come all the way closed, you know? And, it came to within an inch of the — of being closed on the outer — not the inside, but the other side, and wouldn't come any more, unless you really pulled on it.
|SC|Yeah.
|SC|So, and then (garble). You pull it closed, and then once you get the lever over the -- over the center, it comes right closed.
|SC|Okay, Ron, what I'll do when we get up to 3, I'll disconnect your OPS hose, Jack, and I'll let you pull it around behind his back. And, then, you can hold it in the open cabin and I'll actuate his OPS.
|SC|Well, we got a lot of use out of OPS.
|SC|Yeah. Let me actuate it, okay?
|SC|Okay. I'm glad I didn't have to earlier in the week.
|SC|Well, ire, too, you know. I'm glad I didn't have to today either.
|SC|Yeah, I am, too.
|SC|You know, my gloves are dirty, but I think they're dirty from getting ahold of that — those dirty suits of you guys, you know. Ja.ck, did you get (garble)?
|SC|Okay.
|SC|You know how you all — you want to see if there's any residuals from the thrusters out there, you know. Well, I couldn't see anything anywhere except the -on the EVA handrails themselves. And, that really didn't look like it was a residual to me. It's just a discoloration and it's kind of a changing of the condition of the — whatever is on those things, you knew. Hope they're not painted.
|SC|Here's what I'm saying is that they were shiny burnished aluminum, I guess, or whatever, prior to liftoff, but now they're kind of a dirty-looking burnished stuff.
|SC|(Garble)
|SC|Okay, Eon, when I give it that 3, i'll get your hose, Jack can hold it in the cabin, you can activate your own OPS.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Then, we'll watch the cabin come up to 5, and then the OPS will come off, (garble) 102.

Evans was clear outside the spacecraft at 257:45 approximately 10 minutes after hatch open - or depres-surization I should say. He brought back the lunar sounder film cassette at 257:54. His mean heartrate during this1. early period of the EVA was running around 139 and 14 0, and began to taper off as he got more custom to this new environment outside the spacecraft. The panoramic camera cassette was retrieved at approximately 258:03 back into the cabin. Mapping camera cassette 258:16. Evans returned to the command module at approximately 258:28 the hatch was closed the TV turned off just about 4 minutes prior to the hatch closure. Repressurization began at 258:28 at hatch closure and ended just a few moments ago at 258:44. At this time there is an orbital science briefing which will begin in the main auditorium. The air to ground circuit will be recorded for delayed piayb ack at the conclusion of the lunar orbital science briefing and a followup of that will be the change of shift press conference with the flight director Neil Hutchinson. Now estimated to take place at about 4:30. At 258:48 this is Apollo control.

|SC|You don't have enough push back there, do you? Should have used hot water. Or is that thing cold to me? Is that cold? Is it? Boy, that is cold, isn't it? No, don't fool with that, just put the whole thing in there like that. Uh, no.
|SC|Yeah, now you must have used some of that good food tape that's stuck over there. And, there's some on the side of the — the light. We can use those to tape those holes with electric sticky back. Yeah, just about. Yeah. Yeah, that's all. Well, just about. Oh, yeah? There's a chunk. Here's a hole through there. Oh, yeah. We got a lot of tape, I'm sure. We want to tape this whole thing here.

|CAPCOM|Roger, good show.
|SC|I'msorry. I led myself astray. I see it. Yeah, overlap it because it won't stick to that thing very good. No, it just won't stick (garble). We'll just take tape and wrap all the way around the thing. Oops. Otherwise, it's not going to stick period. Good, good. Yeah. It's up? That's right. (Garble) Oh, we've been doing this for two or three flights, you know. Why change it for the last one? Yeah, probably one all the way around. Get your cord out of there. You know, we ought to have a roll of that tape you guys brought. It's ab out t h s. t size, I guess. You got it? Yeah, they're down here. We missed them. (Laughter) Yeah. Keeps the - the light and the water out of it, I guess. You know the water can go through the breather holes. Turn them around this way. Does take a lot of tape, doesn t it. Yeah, sure doesn't stick to a cassette. Sometime. I couldn't find mine. They must have been in the other pair of gloves. Actually, I forgot about them. Well, that's (garble).

|CAPCOM|America,, Houston. If you have somebody handy to the panel, we'd like to take the H2 tank 2 fans to OFF.
|SC|Roger, H2 Tank 2 fans OFF.
|CAPCOM|Thank you Gene.
|SC|We're OMNI Delta. We're reading you loud and clear. Do you want us t: o stay hers;?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmed, Gene. That's good. It's right on the line there. It Delta shows better on the signal strength and Alpha shows better on location. So we'll stick with Delta.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America., Houston. Please advise us of how you are going to handle the waste .stowage vent. Is that open or you going to close it now?
|SC|It's open right now. But we're going to close it here shortly. Do you think we need it closed now?
|CAPCOM|Negative. It's your option. We just want to know what - in case we get an 02 high we might understand what it's from.

|CAPCOM|We have silled up the DSE so we'd like you to go ahead now and do the maneuver listed at 261. Give us the high gain so we can dump it, over.
|SC|Okay, maneuvers coining at you.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and for your information charge number five just went off it was a three pounder and it's jiggling the instruments on the surface there properly.
|SC|Very good. Any new word on the gravimeter Gordie?
|CAPCOM|I haven't got it yet,, Jack. Let me check. Have you heard anything since you asked me the question last night?1
|SC|Well, whenever it was no I haven't heard anything.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll try to get an update.
|SC|I was thinking of the lunar surface gravimeter not the traverse. They apparently don't want to talk to me about the traverse gravimeter,

|PAO|This is Apollo control at 260 hours 44 minutes. We're up live now that completes our tape playback. Apollo 17,153 321 nautical miles from Earth, And one of the comments you heard from capcom advising the crew that the fifth of the explosive charges left on the lunar surface at Taurus Littrow had gone off as programed. The detonation occurred almost precisely on time at 260 hours 24 minutes. This is a one and a half or rather a three pound explosive charge located one and a half kilometers east of the lunar rover. And, we appeared to get good seismic data here in the control center. At the present time the crew is still in the eat period, and we've had relatively little conservation from them. It also from the flight plan looks as if we'll have relatively quiet evening. Very few things scheduled between now and the time the crew is to begin their rest period at 267 hours or about 6 hours 15 minutes from now.
|CAPCOM|America Houston we need - we could use the high gain now NARROW and REACQ.
|CAPCOM|America Houston high gain's not going to work in NARROW now wait a while it's in a skin reflection area.
|SC|Yes, I'm having the same problem - I noticed the same problem. How's this leave it in wide?
|CAPCOM|That will be fine.

|CAPCOM|Ame rica Houston. We're going to have to have the high gain for the dump and also for a little additional work with the HF antennas and the sounder that we're going to read you here in a minute. So, in order to get it we'd like you to pitch up 20 degrees in your present attitude and when you get there then we ought to be able to reacquire and go NARROW.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Once ycu get the antenna locked on in NARROW it will track back to this attitude and that's what we'd like you to dc is come back down to this attitude once you get the antenna locked on.
|SC|Okay, Gordie we've got a good lock now.
|CAPCOM|Okay fine well then go right on back to the program pitch attitude there and it should hold.
|SC|In work .
|CAPCOM|America Houston, we'd like to have some body go to panel 230 and I'll give you. switches real time save you writing them all down to get a couple of things cranked up here over.
|SC|Okay, what do you want in 230?
|CAPCOM|Okay, basically what we're going to do is turn the IR on with the cover closed to keep it warm so you can do that IR on now. And then we're going to put out the HF antennas and listen to HF getting some data on that ground noise from the Earth. If you'll put HF antenna two to extend we'll give you a cue when to go off when it's all the way out. Over.

But each time we make a little more progress to getting it out and we're almost all the way. We are going to give it another cool down period. We'll give you a call when we want to try it again.
|SC|Okay. Sounds good.
|CAPCOM|I do have a bunch of short flight plan updates, none of which is very close in the future. So any time someone has nothing to do, I'll be glad to read them up .
|SC|Okay. Let's eat for a little while, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Fine.
|SC|Is it still plenty cold back there?
|CAPCOM|That's the sum of it. It was clear and were you talking about the Houston weather? Or the SIM bay weather? The SIM bay's getting cold also. It's cool, but it was sunny here today. It'll probably be a cold night since it's cle ar.

|PAO|This i s Apollo Control at 261 hours 43 min utes. The exercise that we've been going through with Ron Evans and the antennas aboard the CSM involve an attempt to extend the second of the two elements of the High-Frequency antenna used in the lunar sounder experiment. Each of these elements is about 34 feet 2 inches long. Both together comprising elements of a single antenna. And, one; of the — one of the elements is extended, and the second is balking at extending. Apparently, due to being cold, and the resistance of pushing the antenna out is heating the motor up. Therefore, we have to turn it on for a period of time until the antenna bogs down and the motor begins to heat, and then turn it off to let the motor cool down. In order to assist in getting it out, and you heard CAPCOM Gordon Fullerton advise the crew that it's going out inches at at time. We're backing off a little bit on it to relieve the tension, and then having the crew go forward, and with each of these steps gaining a few inches on getting the antenna extended. Apollo 17 at this time is 151 300 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a speed of 3440 feet per second.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 261 hours 53 min utes. We've just had the sixth of the charges left on the lunar surface by the Apollo 17 crew detonate, and we're receiving the seismic data in the Control Center. This is the charge designated Number 2, which is a quarter of a pound of explosive, and it had been scheduled to detonate at 261 hours 59 minutes, or about 6 minutes from now. All of the charges we've seen so far have been detonating within about 5 minutes of the nominal or T-ze ro time.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 18:27 GET 261:34 MC967/2
261:34:00|PAO|These charges are part of the seismic profiling experiment and provide scientists with information about the subsurface structure in the landing site area.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control. There's one more of the seismic charges to be detonated, charge Number 3, which will be the eighth and final charge, and it's scheduled to be exploded on command from the ground at about 264 hours 10 minutes, roughly 2 hours 10 minutes from now. This charge is the closest of the eight to the roving vehicle located about 65 meters away.
|SC|Hello, Houston. America. Are you ready to maneuver here to the UV stellar target attitude?
|CAPCOM|Stand by, I'll check.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 CST 18:51 GET 261:59 MC968/1
261:59:00|CAPCOM|Stand by I'll check. Okay, I guess everybody is1in agreement. Go ahead and high gain should stay on during this maneuver.
|SC|Okay, we're maneuvering. Hope the Sun comes in the1window on this next maneuver.
|CAPCOM|Is it getting cool up there?
|SC|Well I'm freezing something off.
|CAPCOM|Hey we got a little procedure to warm things up in1the cockpit if you'd like it.
|SC|We heard that earlier and we'll pass on that right now.
|CAPCOM|Was it the one about turning on inverter 3? SG1No, we'didn't hear that one why don't you tell us what that one is.
|CAPCOM|Okay try putting inverter 3 on main A that will put some heat load into the system and then go to manual on the temp in valve. Go down and adjust the vap out temperature to 59 degrees - make it 55 degrees, 55 degrees. And that should help warm things up.
|SC|Okay, we'll let you know if we give that a try and Gordie I guess we're ready to copy some of those flight plan updates.
|CAPCOM|Okay, fine. We'll keep an eye on the temp out so that let you know if it's getting away. Let's see — 1st s start on — stand by one - start on page 375 at 2 63 ho urs.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Okay, down at 263:40 where it lists the jets to use for spinup or for damping rather. We're going to change the jets to be used for damping since those ones listed didn't work so hot last night. Want to use all of quad delta, delta 1, 2, 3 and 4 and charlie 3 and 4 those 6 jets in place of the ones listed.

This charge is 1/8 of a pound. The smallest of the charges, but also the closest to the lunar Rover vehicle, it'd located about 65 meters from the Rover, and again the expected time of detonation is about 264 hours 10 minutes.

263:29:00|AMERICA|Hey, Gordy, Jack.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Jack.
|AMERICA|I fail to understand why all my friends who used to operate in the back room, even though it's Sunday, why they haven't given you a sort of an interim report on what they think happened at Taurus-Littrow. They usually have those things available.
|CAPCOM|Well, I did - you mean the whole geological summary?
|AMERICA|Well, just the general thing that they pass around after a day or so, I think, in the time frame they work i n.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, there has been such a thing I think you're referring to. I guess there's a more formal version to coming that's supposed to be due out tomorrow morning, but there was a summary, fairly lengthy, on entire science, including the field of geology, which I'll try to dig up and maybe read to you if you wish. Over.
|AMERICA|Well, i don't need a lot. I guess it might be useful to have a general summary maybe tomorrow morning sometime if we have some time in the flight plan of what people have seen up to date on things that we wouldn't normally be familiar with, for preparation for that press conference.
|CAPCOM|Okay, sounds like a good idea. On the - your gravimeter questions, the TGE numbers for the comparison I believe you wanted, between the north and the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills, just aren't available. The whole TGE team took their data and left town, evidently. And - We have been unable to come up with any good numbers on that question. The undersurface gravimeter - okay - break break here. We need a VERB 48 load as shown and then -
|AMERICA|It's already in, Gordy,
|CAPCOM|Okay. So, you can go ahead and do the maneuver then. On the LSG,, still no positive success. They've sent just about all the commands they it take with no luck at levelling the beam and so they've decided to fall back and the whole team is regrouping to consider further course of action. They've turned off the command to ED until sometime tomorrow when they'll try again, evidently, with whatever they come up with in their conference. Over.
|AMERICA|Okay. We're certainly pulling for them, of cours e.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|Gordy, I'm afraid that apparently it's a problem just in the levelling commands, or it is receiving other commands, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|That's the impression I have. I hate to say yes certainly. My impression is that it won't, won't level. It will accept commands but the beam will just not level for a reason they just don't fully understand.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 263:29 CST 20:22 MC-971/2
263:29:00|AMERICA|Okay, did that mean that you might - maybe you could ask Bob when you see him or something - does that mean the beam is not free, or is it not level?
|CAPCOM|As I understand it - stand by one - Jack, I got quick agricultural explanation of the problem. Evidently, it's the two plates between which the beam itself is suspended, are adjustable so that - by ground command, so that by driving these plates back and forth, they try to center the beam between them and then the data is initiated when the beam vibrates between the plates it changes capacitance or at least that's the general principle. And the problem is that by driving, they can command the plates back and forth and stop the stop but they cannot get the beam to leave - leave one of the plates. It's hung up against one plate and this could be caused by one of the wires that's suspended, sort of hangs the beam pendulum fashion, being broken so that it has cockeyed off to one side. I guess that's the best guess as to the malfunction at the moment. It's presently in use as a seismometer returning data in that mode, but useless in it's primary intended data taking mode. Over.
|AMERICA|Like, did they see the beam leave the plates at all as I shook it there near the last of our third EVA?
|CAPCOM|I guess the answer to that is "no". They saw you jostling it around and could tell that you were from the data, but have no evidence that the beam ever moved from the one plate.
|AMERICA|Isn't there any possibility that the tele metry is giving them a false indication of not levelling? Or not centering, I guess would be a better word?
|CAPCOM|Stand by. No, Jack, evidently they've eliminated that possibility. They're certain it's a problem - a mechanical problem.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Jack, reference your - the blink you noticed, or possibly noticed - we, looking at the data see about 30 seconds prior to the time we think you mentioned that it happened, but that's close to the time fra me, I guess, a one or two amp oscillation in the main B voltage or current, and it only lasted for one or two data cycles, or like a tenth or two—tenths of a second is all. We would like to know, though, approximately what setting all the flood lights are at right n ow.
|AMERICA|LEP are full bright and the left hand are about three quarters, right hand's about three quarters. Jack's the only one who saw that. we'didn't - Ron and I didn't see anything on that one field trip. If it happened, It was awful quick.

264:02:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 264 hours 15 minutes. The ALSEP staff support room here in Mission Control reports that the last of eight seismic charges left on the lunar surface by the Apollo 17 crew has detonated and a charge went off at 264 hours 14 minutes or about 4 minutes later than the nominal time of 264 hours 10 minutes and within the normal range that we ve seen for the other seven charges of about 5 minutes either side of the planned time. This charge was a 1/8 pound charge located about 65 meters from the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the charge that was closest to the landing site of Apollo 17. These charges are part of the Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment — the seismic waves produced by the explosions provide information that scientists can use in interpreting the sub-surface structure in the area of the landing site.
|SC|Hous ton, 17.
|CAPCOM|Okay, go ahead.
|SC|Hey, I was just wondering how the high gain's working out for you.
|CAPCOM|Looking good, Jack.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston, over .
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|The high gain is holding on here but we think we can improve - the time we can hold on to - narrow beam waves a little bit if you tweak it to pitch plus 15 and yaw plus 185.
|SC|Gordy, you said plus 15?
|CAPCOM|Affirmative, plus 15 and a plus 185.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Gordy, the cannister's changed.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SC|1 guess you're looking at the orange light, too, huh?
|CAPCOM|That1s affirmative.
|PAO|This is: Apollo Control. The orange light that Jack Schmitt was referring to is a gimbal warning light - one of the caution warning system lights that, in this case, indicates the attitude of the spacecraft approaching gimbal lock. However, this is of no concern. The passive tttermal control attitude that the spacecraft is in was expectea to bring them close enough to that limit to trigger the light, but will not cause any problems. The spacecraft at this time is in the passive thermal control mode:, rotating about itrs longitudinal axis at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to distribute the heating s.nd cooling effects of sunlight on one side and the heatsink cf space on the other and produce uniform heating and cooling within the spacecraft structure.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 264 hours 37 minutes. About an hour and a half ago Jack Schmitt reported what appeared to him as a transitory blink of :he spacecraft ughts. He asked if we'd seen anything in the telemetry that indicated any sort of a glitch or a problem in the spacecraft electrical system. At that time the EECOM looked at his telemetry displays and said everything appeared to be normal, but to be doubly sure, we had the data, replayed from the receiving site at Madrid where it had been picked up from the
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 20:5SCST 264:02GET MC973/2
264:02:00|PAO|(continued) spacecraft and looked at the data second by second. Aaron has completed that review, John Aaron, the EECOM, and reports that he saw nothing abnormal during the period of time in question. However, there were a couple of instances where the spacecraft current levels increased or spiked, as they say, about an amp or two, but this is an increase of 1 or 2 amps out of a total of 78 to 80 some amperes being drawn by the spacecraft at this time, and is not considered abnormal. Gene Cernan reported after Schmitt asked the question that neither he nor Command Module pilot Ron Evans had seen the blink in lights that Jack Schmitt reported. Schmitt also allowed as how it may have been a -a figment of his imagination. There is, as they say, no - no explanation for the apparent blink in lights. We see nothing here on the ground that indicates anything abnormal in the spacecraft. Crew also reported that the spacecraft cabin was a bit on the chilly side and we read to them a procedure to increase the cabin temperature. we'don't have a direct reading of cabin temperature - we can deduce indirectly what that temperature would be from air inlet temperatures which generally read lower than the cabin temperature itself. The EECOM estimates that the temperature in the cabin has been running somewhere between 68 to 70 degrees - probably in the high sixties, and hopefully beginning to come up a bit now. At the present time Apollo 17 is 145 300 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3600 feet per second now. The crew is scheduled to begin a sleep period at about 267 hours. They've completed the exercise period. Ron Evans, who is on the bio-medical sensors, is exercising and the surgeon reported seeing the -seeing his heart rate rise, indicating that he was exercising.

|PAO|And at this time the surgeon reports Lunar Module Pilot, Jack Schmitt, is exercising as indicated by a rise in his heart rate.
|SC|Hey. Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, Capt ain *
|SC|Okay, Gordo, I took my Comm carrier apart, you know, cut tn is little cloth covering that goes from the plug on up to the headset and what have you, and sura enougn, there's 2 little broken wires in there and the next one is a little bit — the next one to it is a little bit loose also. But I found a little piece of metal and I bent it to the - conform to the shape of the wire and I've got it taped up real tight right now and I m going to see if it works for a while, make sure that it doesn't cut in or out you know or something like that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good luck.
|SC|(laughter) Okay. Of course I still have the light - lightweight headset. I'd just as soon wear the comm carrier for the reentry, if possible.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Say, we've investigated a little more on that possible spike that a - or was alleged that Jack, thought he might have seen, and we mentioned, I think, in response to than about a one or two amp jump, we're looking further, we see those all along and we think they re probably due to a minimum impulse jet firings. We're trying to correlate that data, but the conclusion right now is that we really don't see any thing on the data to support what Jack m:' ght have seen. SCOkay, mighty fine. We just wanted a view in case there was something there. Wanted to make sure you all took a look at it.
|CAPCOM|You bet .. S'-Yeah. knobby, okay Knobby, where are you. Key, I can see a few stars out there on this side of the window. Can't: see any thing there, that's right behind the - look out, there it is, though.

|CAPCOM|Yeah, we're all sat.
|SC|Okay. How about 58 45.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and then when you do that we want you to stop the PTC right now, and we want you to use the jet configuration - configuration we used to start it up, that's all of quad Delta and Charlie 3 and 4 rather than the Jets listed in the flight plan. Over.
|SC|Okay
|CAPCOM|And, while we are mentioning Jet configurations, that Jet configuration is, this is another change to a change to a change, and we're sorry about this, but we want you to use those Jets all of Delta and Charlie 3 and 4 for every stop and start of PTC from here on out all the way through the final PTC exit just prior to mid course 7, which is shown in the flight plan and the way we want it, using combo jets for that final one. But use Delta I through 4 and Charlie 3 and 4 from here on out for going in and out of PTC and I can read you all the time so that applies to so if you can just remember it you can save some writing. Your cho ice. Ove r.

||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 265:01 CST 2153 MC-975/1
265:01:00|AMERICA|It's probably right down here in the spacecraft somewhere. (garble) okay. Gordy, you want Dodo one, two, three and four, and Charlie three and four for damping, and you want Bravo two and Delta two for spinup as the flight plan says.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, and the damping is for both entry and exit of PTC., so from here on out except that final one which is coupled just prior to (garble) 47.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|And, you don't need to wait 'til roll of 14. You can go ahead and stop it right now - we prefer it that way as a matter of fact. Over.
|AMERICA|Okay. Is that a CDU glitch here, Gordy? We sure did. Hello, Houston, can you read America?
|CAPCOM|Yeah. I was just trying to get an answer for you. Yeah, it looks at first glance like maybe we saw one. Stand by. I'll get you a better update.
|AMERICA|Gordy, why don't you give me the best OMNI?1'
|CAPCOM|OMNI Delta is the best rate at the moment.
|AMERICA|Well, we'll hang on to you here as we go - you were just on the verge of dropping out but we'll stay with you on the high gain. Yeah, Gordy, our ball, let's see, reads here about 256 roll and yaw - and pitch is 2 - or 227, and yaw is about 42 degrees.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Gene-o, evidently you definitely had a CDU glitch. We're trying to come up with an attitude that you can fly to on the ball as it stands right in SCS Stand by.
|AMERICA|Houston, both SCS and the IMU ball are okay, I think. They're both the same.. Well, they're almost -except for the TDC - except: for the GDC, drift, they're both the same. So the error is in the NOUN 20 computer.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. Ron, does the GDC and the IMU attitude agree right now?
|AMERICA|Yes, they do, they agree, give or take for the two or three degrees that the GDC drift is all.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|AMERICA|And there 1 s our NOUN 20 on the computer now.
|CAPCOM|Roger. America, Houston. What we'd like you to do is - were those ball angles you read 25604 - let's see - get the right order - 256227 and 042. Are those still about the - where you are?
|AMERICA|Yeah, that's affirmed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're going to try to compute an attitude that'll get us to high gain so we have a little more visibility under the system. That's our problem right now.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 265:01 CST 2153 MC-975/2
265:01:00|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. What we'd like you to do is roll 180 degrees to about 076, roll attitude.
|AMERICA|Okay, we'll roll her back to 076.
|CAPCOM|Okay, then once you get there, the high gain angle should be pitch to minus 50 and yaw two zero five. Ove r .
|AMERICA|Minus 50 and two zero five. Okay, (garble) Go r dy .
|CAPCOM|Okeydoke.
|AMERICA|You might check. I was loaded NOUN 22 and you might just double check and see what you saw down there and make sure I wasn't loading on NOUN 20.
|CAPCOM|Okay, good call, we'll do that. Can you give us best OMNI as you roll around?
|AMERICA|Okay, we'll try. Okay, it's OMNI Delta now .
|CAPCOM|Roger, loud and clear.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 265:15 CST 22:09 MC 976/1
265:15:00|SC|Houston, I doubt if it's a problem, but the UV cover's still open.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Jack. Okay, we'd like for you to zero the CDU's now.
|SC|Look's about right. Looks good, Gordy, it matches the ball.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we see that. We're getting high bit rate now, by the way, also.
|SC|I don't know, you can track it down, but I called up NOUN 20 to check the roll angles and it was not what we were using in the book here, of 14 degrees, and I very easily could nave loaded 20, instead of 22.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll check that out.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 265 hours 18 minutes. The CDU glitch that is being discussed, refers to a small piece of - refers to a small piece of erroneous information which appears to have gotten through the CDU. The CDU being the coupling data unit, which is a black box that receives information from various measuring devices on the spacecraft, and converts them to a form that is meaningful to the computer. The CDU or coupling data unit in question, is one that handles this transfer of information from a measuring device in this case the inertial measurement unit to the computer. The indications that we've gotten so far from the checks run and the telemetry data that we've looked at, do not show any problem. The essential thing is to understand what the nature of the erroneous information that was fed through this CDU to the computer might be. It's very conceivable that there will be a ready explanation for an erroneous bit of information getting through. If, in fact, there is some problem, and the CDU can be expected to continue feeding erroneous information to the computer, there is a program that can be loaded into the erase-able memory of the computer which in effect allows it to question the information that's fed through and to in effect, make a determination as to whether that information is reasonable. If it's not reasonable, the computer then throws it out. And we now have high bit rate data from the spacecraft so we'll be able to look in great detail at this particular aspect of the guidance system.
|CAPCOM|Now ready to proceed on with the flight plan with the VERB 49 to the sleep UGC attitude. We have not had a chance to go back over the data but we'll give you a call as soon as we get a chance to check it. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. One other interesting thing was we went back and looked at NOUN 22 after the glitch. We still had the NOUN 2 2 angles I had loaded for the previous VERB 49 at 263 40 which either even makes me feel more like I did not load 22 on this last time around.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 265:15 CST 22:09 MC 976/2
265:15:00|CAPCOM|Yeah, it sounds - it sounds like we might have the problem nailed down but we'll double check that.
|SC|This is a gross admission if that's the case, but I'd rather have it that way.
|CAPCOM|We won't hold it against you. America, Houston, why don't you hold the PRO on — on this VERB 49 until we have a chance to check and see if we're going to a gimble lock problem.
|SC|Okay. Gordy, can I. use that roll we got 142? I'll stand by until you check that ginble lock out.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. We're checking that. Your answer is negative, Geno. The present roll - the maneuver should - it shows on our computer, you'll go through gimbal lock so we suggest you go to 14 and then back to maneuver. Over.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Can you give us AUTO and NARROW on high gain? Present angles are okay.
|SC|Okay, Houston. The computer knows where the stars are in here.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'd like AUTO and NARROW and make sure you've selected high gain also.
|SC|Wise guy. Works every time, doesn't it?
|CAPCOM|Rog.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 265:31 CST 2225 MC-977/1

|AMERICA|Okay, I've been sitting here thinking about it. Yeah, I had - and also the glitch occurred when I did the final (garble) or so, plus we had the two axis glitch in a number of things. I'm glad you found that. Makes me feel better. We were discussing whether or not you needed an EMP or not.
|CAPCOM|We 1A, there mus t be one for the situation.

|CAPCOM|Us, also.

|CAPCOM|Well, I can give it to you in hours symetry interface right away - 38 hours 42 minutes and 4 seconds. And in miles you're 143 500.
|AMERICA|Okay, thank you.
|CAPCOM|Picking up speed all the way. America, Hous ton, over.
|AMERICA|Go ahead, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|I've been talking to Don Batey and Dick Crews and looking over a transcript of a science press conference we edited up. It was kinda ragged but possibly interesting summary of the science as it stands now. In response to your question of items that might help you to prepare for tomorrow's press conference., I can come with you with those words any time you wish.
|AMERICA|You can come with them now.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Let's start with the LSPE. All eight charges have now been exploded and they were all on schedule and produced excellent signals. These data were used in conjunction with the ascent stage liftoff and also it's impact data which should give us an excellent picture of the geologic structure of the outer three kilometers of the Moon. This little summary I'm reading right now is - was written by Joe Watkins. The geophone array is functioning beautifully and we're already talking about it's potential for a listening mode for study of meteorite impact frequency. We still don't have precise EP locations on ray batson so the following interpretation will almost certainly be changed when we get better data and field tapes which we will use to refine our arrival time. Bearing the above in mind, mv preliminary interpretation is as follows: the low velocity layer seems to be thicker than higher in velocity than at either Apollo 14 or 16 sites. I think this may mean that the low velocity layer here includes dark mantle material as well as the regolith. Details of the higher velocity substraight are fuzzy but velocities increase with depth in a way which will be consistent with a thick accumulation or lava flow. This probably represents the subfloor material and he concludes by saying you guys did a great job. See you after splash. On the same subject, Dr. Kovac went a little further and he just recently admits to seeing evidence of two high velocity layers, especially after the 6 pound charge was fired - that evidence showed up. He also mentions in his press conference yesterday that the data point allowed by the ascent stage impact was very important - the fact that they got it in about 9 kilometers away - that data is right in a critical range where we see a big change in the percentage -velocity change - I'm getting kinda balled up here In the words, but that data is very important because it's in where the steep gradient and the velocity change occurs. On looking through here, I guess in summary - I'll read a couple of sentences again out of the press conference - we'do find evidence of lunar crossed as we'did in the past but we may have to thin it considerably. We may have in fact, have to thin it as much as 25 kilometers instead of 60 that they believed it was up to now. And they're thinking they may have to lower the velocity of seismic waves in the mantle which I guess, at last guess, was around 9 kilometers per second. Now, it's looking more like 7.5 and the crustal velocity is probably as slow as 6.3 kilometers per second. Okay, yeah, that was — that last data was released from Dr. Latham and he was interpreting that data mainly from the S-IVB impact and reading from some of the other seismic sites. Any questions on that? I realize that this is pretty ragged. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 265:31 CST 2225 MC-977/2
265:31:00|AMERICA|Oh, actually, it's great, Gordy. Did Kovac indicate his tentative depth for the second high velocity?
|CAPCOM|No, as far as the information we have here - it's just that - no, I don't see any - the only thing I can see is he mentions we're getting a depth sample down to 3 to 4 kilometers but that was before all the charges had gone off. So, I think, as I say, he just doesn't really state that yet.
|AMERICA|Yeah, it's a little early. Okay, good. Sounds like what we saw in the field to a certain extent.
|CAPCOM|Okay, on the heat low, it's continuing to work perfectly. It's stabilizing out and, at the present time, they show about a degree centigrade per meter radiant. Apollo 15 is stabilized at about 1.8 and it looks like the 17 site's headed for about the same which gives consistent data for the two sites. Looks like that's what is going to result when it reaches it's final equillibrium. And so that - if you call that - those two sites typical of the Moon, then that leads one to the following conclusions that that data requires that there be a total greater abundance of radiocative isotopes on the Moon as compared to the Earth, so there would be an implication here for a fundamental difference in composition between the two. And, the higher number of isotopes would, in turn, require that they be located very near the surface implying very substantial differentiation of the material, at least compositionally, or stratisfactionally. it's not necessary that it would nave to be stratified. It was only required at it be stratified m most of - in that most of the isotopes e concentrated m tne upper layers of the Moon.

CAPuOM1(continued) But, you can see that there's a significant difference between the landing site and the foothills on both sides. The Shorty crater showed a slight positive an omoly compared to the landing site but it's less than a millegal, which is sort of - you start to think "Well, that means a localized volcanic center" but it's - nobody's really going out that far on a limb. The - they were especially appreciative of the 2A stop which was - let's see -well, it verified the extremely sharp gradient of the anomo-lous condition from the foothills as you go back into the valley. The 2A stop - I ' n: trying to find the number here -Okay, one's a minus 36 at station 2 to a minus 29 at 2A so it's " it really changes quickly as you get away from the mountains. J.E. summarized his feelings by saying that a — a negative gravity anomoly which you measured right at the South Massif and the North Massif clearly indicate that the valley is filled with a higher density of material than the material which makes up the Massif. So, that if the material underlying the smaller Taurus-Littrow - say is phosaltic in composition and has a density of about 3, the material which makes up the Massif has a s ub s tan ti ally lower density. He goes on to say that we're not sure exactly what the density difference is but if it's as large as 20 percent difference then the material in the floor of the valley and the — well, the thickness of the high density material in the valley has to be on the order of about 1 1/2 kilometers thick, so that's a - I guess that's a minimum thickness, assuming the radius difference in densities. That's very interesting, Gordie.

265:48:00|CAPCOM|Yeah, there really - everything is really tied in the original theories on the structure and make-up of the valley. Everything seems to be falling right in there and that's what has — has the whole crowd of scientists around here really smiling. A - let's see - let me find out what s next here. Okay, it was Strangway's turn next and he didn't have any results to present, of course, because he's got to get the tape back first, really. How-every, the Orbital Sounder - the metallogical sounder, when they made the pass across the site with the transmitter on - no, I got it backwards — when it was in a listening mode, listening to the ground transmitter's signal, they found ' that the signal was in exactly the frequency range that it was supposed to be and they picked up the - exactly the right sequence rate once every 8/10ths of a second. And when they calculated the power levels that we were putting out just exactly the one watt that we were expected to put out. So that - that everything looks good as far as the operation of the transmitter and without going into all the

They're very hopeful that when the tape gets back we'll have good data on at least some of the LGS and they're - they're waiting for you to bring it to them. Dick Kruse is here and he mentioned that all your pains, Geno, on brushing dust off of it, probably saved the day. If it's there, it was just due to that that it did work because it was really on the ragged edge there.

But I will leave a request so that when Parker gets you up in the morning, maybe he can summarize that or answer any questions in that area that you might have. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. Thank you very much.

|CAPCOM|Yeah, Ron. As a matter of fact, talked to Jan, and well her words to summarize the whole show that you put on this afternoon was "out of this world" which is I guess a pretty good way to put it. John and Jamie were speechless when you waved and called Hello to them. And Jan closed by saying that you - you're going to have to hurry home and help rebuild the wall that was broken out by a huge mob of people that were in your house this afternoon during the EVA.

|SC|What about the other side of the tracks, Gordy? Any word from over there?
|CAPCOM|Hey, I haven't really talked to anyone in the other two families today so I'm sure that everything's fine or we would have heard it but I'll try to get a last minute update on that before you hit the sack.

|SC|Did you have a table there of the various gravity readings and if so what did we get at Van Serg? In your gravity to your window - to the landing site - landing point?
|CAPCOM|No, Jack. I don't have it. I'll ask but I think the ones I gave you the 4 places, Shorty, North, South and Sculptured Hills are all we got. I'll check.

|SC|Okay, you have it. REACQ and NARROW.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 266 hours 17 minutes. The crew at the present time is establishing the spacecraft in its passive thermal control mode. This is rotating it about 3 revolutions per hour for thermal control which means that they're preparing to get some sleep. Sleep period is scheduled to begin at 267 hours and the PTC or passive thermal control mode is the normal set up for the spacecraft to maintain thermal equalibrium during a sleep period. The crew had reported a possible glitch as they referred to it with the CDU or coupling data unit about an hour ago at 265 hours 7 minutes. We looked in great detail at the telemetry data and replayed data from the time when this glitch occured, and by looking at the data, have confirmed that there is no problem with the coupling data unit, and the guidance and navigation system which it forms a part of. To summarize the sequence of events, Gene Cernan was in the process of loading numbers into the spacecraft computer, telling It to maneuver to the proper attitude for passive thermal control, when he noticed that his eight-ball attitude indicator and his computer attitude readout disagreed. These 2 readouts if everything is as it should be, should be in very close agreement. Noting disagreement there, he advised that there was a possible glitch in the CDU or coupling data unit which feed information from the inertial measurement unit to the computer. The glitch being possibly that the CDU was feeding erroneous information to the computer. If this was in fact the case, the computer knowledge of the spacecraft attitude would become impaired. It would have been possible to work around this sort of problem if it were a transient problem. Now this would have been done by loading a program into the computer erasable memory which in effect would tell the computer to disregard imputs which were unlikely or unreasonable. As it turned out, Gene Cernan came up with the explanation for the glitch. He suggested that he may have loaded the incorrect numbers into the computer when he was asking the - or telling the computer to maneuver to a new attitude. Rather than telling the computer to maneuver to a new attitude by punching in the wrong numbers, he in effect told it - that's it's attitude numbers were incorrect and that it should load a new set of attitude numbers which the computer proceeded to do. And at the same time, the next time that he looked at and compared the eight-ball with the computer, he of course, found that they didn't agree. We were able to confirm that this in fact had happened by replaying data, looking at the numbers that were fed into the computer second by second and sure enough just as Cernan had suggested, a wrong series of numbers had been inadvertently loaded. The computer had done precicely what it was told to do and the indication of an error from the coupling data units was displayed.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/17/72 GET 265:51 CST 22:50 MC 979/3
265:51:00|PAO|Making a. long story short, the coupling data units are functioning precisely as they should and there's no problem with the guidance aid navigation system. Cernan, I m sure a bit chragrived at a procedurel error but as with everyone on the ground, relieved that a potentially significant problem turned out to be no problem at all.

267:59:00|CAPCOM|Apollo 17, Houston. We'd like to talk to you guys before you go to bed, please.
|AMERICA|Okay, Bob.
|CAPCOM|Okay,, we panicked there, I guess, or we got our chains tweaked cause we saw you go voice off and we wanted to talk to you guys about two or three things before you went to bed. For one thing, we'don't see the cabin pumped up yet with the OPS as per plan and we'don't have the onboard readouts yet, and we'd like to find out who's going to be on the COMM and talk to Ron about his headset, 1 guess the general concensus of opinion down here, unless we know more; about the fix, is there are some possible serious consequences like blowing up the audio panel if those wires did get together and short out, depending upon which wires they are. So, there's some concern about that.
|AMERICA|Okay, let's get you the read out first and we're going to box up the cabin here very shortly with the OP S.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'd also like to get the Infrared to OFF, please - the IR.
|AMERICA|Okay, it's coming off here shortly. Okay, Bob, the RCS reads 65, 57, 61 and 60.
|CAPCOM|Okay, copy those.
|AMERICA|Houston, are you reading America? CAPCOM -I'm reading you now. The last thing we got ftoe you was the RCS quantities. we'didn't get the bat q uantiiies,
|AMERICA|You haven't heard Ron at all?
|CAPCOM|Nope, haven't heard Ron a bit.
|AMERICA|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Sounds like the headset -
|AMERICA|Well, sure, I'm going to try again.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Nc. America, we're not reading Ron at all right now.
|AMERICA|Okay, he's been on the light weight head set talking to you all this time - why don't I just check those switches?
|CAPCOM|Okay. Which headset is broken? The Snoopy?
|AMERICA|Yeah, Ron's — Ron's Snoopy helmet.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Hey, are you reading me now, Houston?
|CAPCOM|Ah, I read you loud and clear now, Ron.
|AMERICA|Okay, I'm wearing the light weight headset now. On the comm carriers, there's a whole bunch of wires, about eight of them - looks like they're twisted pairs - twisted in fours really. They come up through the thing . And, two of those eight wires are cat - are broken in two. The hot end, or the end that comes up from the plug going toward the headset - those two wire s b o t h come out individually and individually tapea, each one of them. And then the whole group - I bent them out of the way so they wouldn't be touching anything, so they wouldn't touch insulation or tape. I bent them out of the way and taped the whole side of it just to keep the rest of them from breaking in two, and it looks like a pretty good fix on the thing, really. However, if you have any concern about blowing the audio panel up, I'll just go ahead and wear the light weight headset.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 GET 267:59 CST 0052 MC-983/2
267:59:00|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. Yes, the concern here is not only which wires they are, but the potential does exist if one of those shorts to ground to blow the audio panel or at least the circuit breaker, depending upon which wire it is. I gather that what you've done - that you haven't wired the broken wires together, but it's just sort of covered the bare leaf and wired them out of the way. Is that right?
|AMERICA|Yeah, that's correct. It was too close to the - there is a stiff piece of plastic that comes out of the headset itself out of the bottom of the left earset, and it's broken off too close to the bottom of it there to strip the wires down and wire them together at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay, roger on that. I guess - let us think about it overnight. Off hand, our opinion is, as long as you've got a spare headset, let's wear the spare headset -that spare meaning a light weight. If you're going to be on COMM tonight, I guess we off hand suggest wearing the light weight tonight. Over. How does that strike you?
|AMERICA|Okay. Yeah - no problem. I won't be on COMM tonight but I'll be wearing the light weight headset anyhow. The only time I was thinking about it - wearing the other one at all - would be for entry, and there's no problem there. I'll just stick to the light weight headset around my neck and put that one around my ears just to use as a bump pad, is all.
|CAPCOM|Okay, let us think about it overnight and we'll talk with some people about it. Let's see, is Jack going to be on the headset tonight and the biomed both?
|AMERICA|Yeah, Jack will be on tonight with the biomed and the headset.
|CAPCOM|Okay. We'd like to get one more valve check there, America. Like to check our waste water tank inlet valve to auto. EECOMM is in the flat portion and you can't verify that right now by it's buildup.

|CAPCOM|This is the new CAPCOM one, say again the question? Four degrees equaled distance from the Earth?
|SC|Yes sir, what is 4 degrees equal in miles from the Earth?
|CAPCOM|RETRO says that 4 degrees essential angle equals 94 K. You guys are out at about 125 K right now. SC ^ Okay, Bob, I was looking at the flight plan and it said field of view is 4 degrees.

|SC|That's affirm. I've, got some reports for you, if you're ready to copy.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we're all set.
|SC|Okay. DDR Menu, I'll try negative reporting. He did not eat 3 apricot sugar cubes, pears and at lunch he did not eat, half of the cereal bar. And at dinner he did not eat tomato soup, half a hamburger, and the date fruit cake. On lunch be had also, positive now, lemonade, 2 pecans, and 1/4 of a chocolate bar. Okay, and last night, he had about 5 hours of fair sleep, no medication and 2-1/2 cans of water and his PRD is 17060, that's right 60. Okay, for the LMP, day 12: He did not eat breakfast pears, for lunch looks like he ate it all, for dinner he did not eat the tomato soup, half a hamburger, mustard, pudding, and that's it. And add to breakfast, another cup of coffee, bag of coffee, excuse me. And the lunch an orange drink, an orange pineapple, another coffee, graham cracker cubes, 4 of them, 2 pecans and 1/4 of a chocolate bar. And ah - his PRD is 24188, and 6 hours intermitten sleep, 1-1/2 cans of water, and took one lomatil last night, just as we were turning in, as a result of the Evans affair, catching up with the LMP. The CMP negative reporting again, did not eat: Sausage, fruit coctail, orange beverage, and for lunch he did not eat the peaches, and for dinner he did not eat tomato soup, and the carmel candy. Add to breakfast, coffee, 4 sugar cookies, 4 jelly candies and that's for breakfast. For lunch, add: lemonade, coffee, 2 pecans and 1/4 of a chocolate bar, 1/2 of a chocolate bar, excuse me. Okay, his PRD is 15058, he had about 5 hours of fair sleep, and two sniffs of nose drops, and two lomotil yesterday, and he had 5 cans of water. And that should do it Bob.

|SC|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 275 46 ground elapsed time. Apollo 17 now 28 hours and 31 minutes from entry back into the Earth's atmosphere. Approaching Earth at a velocity of 4397 feet per second. Still 119 924 nautical miles out. There were 2 pieces of wakeup music this morning. The first was "We've Only Just Begun" by the Carpenters and the second was an unidentified Christmas Carol by the neighbors of the Evans family recorded yesterday. Since awakening, the crew has passed up their medical and sleep report and food consumption negative reporting of what they didn't eat out of their daily menu. Meanwhile, the Spaceflight Meteorology Group of the National Weather Service said this morning that weather conditions are expected to be satisfactory,
|SC|It's almost like having a fire in the fire place .
|CAPCOM|Roger, glad you're comfortable.
|PAO|Meanwhile, back in the South Pacific, the weather forcast for the planned landing area, approximately 360 nautical miles southeast of Pago Pago, calls for partly cloudy skies, widely scattered rain showers, variable winds at 10 miles per hour, seas of 3 feet and temperature of 80 degrees. At 275 48 standing by, this is Apollo Control.

275:50:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead, Bob.
|CAPCOM|How would you like a quick look at sports here and then into the news summary while you're having your breakfast ?
|SC|We'd like the whole thing,
|CAPCOM|Well, I guess that we all assume maybe you're like the rest of us and turn to your sport page first sometime so we thought we'd recap the pro football action yesterday, in a rather strange day, since there were only 2 games that really made any difference and I think the scores kind of showed the day. In the American Conference playoff games coming up next weekend, Oakland will play at Pittsburg. Pittsburg getting Into the playoffs for the first time in 40 years. The Cleveland Browns will take on the undefeated Miami Dolphins, who have won 14 straight. In the National Conference, Dallas will be at San Francisco Saturday and Greenbay plays at Washington on Sunday. Quickly recapping some of the scores from yesterday. On that sad, sad one here in Houston, Cincinnati rolled over the Oilers 61 to 17. There were 3 touchdowns scored in the fourth quarter within less than 5 minutes of play. All on interceptions on the part of Cincinnati. New York Giants - it says upset Dallas 23 to 3 - I question the upset since Dallas was already in the playoffs and in what I watched it looked like they were aware that they were already in the playoffs. Buffalo upset Washington 24-17, and again it's a questionable upset because 0. J. Simpson had a great day, and Larry Brown from Washington was kept on the bench for the whole game. Oakland 28 over Chicago 21, Detroit 34 over Los Angeles 17. Los Angeles hopes for any playoff berth have been knocked out by San Francisco's win on Saturday, and it looked like they played that way on Sunday. Cleveland - in a real tough one up in New York - with 30 knot winds and gale force winds and lots of snow and cold defeated the New York Jets 26 to 10. Greenbay 30 over New Orleans 20 in a tough one which saw 2, 2 touchdowns being scored off of blocked punts. Kansas City 17 over Atlanta 14, and again, Atlanta's chances for a playoff berth had been wiped out on Saturday and apparently, they played that way on Sunday. Denver 45 over New England 21, St. Louis 24 over Philidelpha 23. Pittsburgh defeated San Diego 24 to 2. On Saturday Miami had taken Baltimore 16 to nothing, and as I previously mentioned, San Francisco defeated Minnesota on Saturday 20 to 17. Just one little note, Jack, you migh': be interested in this mornings paper, concerning the New Orleans Saints. Dave Parks from the New Orleans Saints, announced his retirement, and he kind of took a rap at the Saints in claiming that they were the team that did not want to win, and that he was retiring unless they would trade him to a winner. It sounds like our friend over

275:50:00|CAPCOM|there night have some problems this winter come contract time. In pro basketball last night, the Houston Rockets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 110 to 109. Jack Marin had 35 points, Mike Newlin had 34. In college basketball, UCLA remains number one in the latest ratings. Second ranked Florida State was beaten this weekend by Princeton, 61 to 59, Third ranked Maryland won, as did fourth-ranked Marquette, fifth-ranked Minnesota and number six, North Carolina State. Indiana is rated 15th, Houston is 16th. We can't find Purdue, Kansas or Cal Tech in the ratings right now. There's one bowl game tonight. Iowa State, who hat: taken a 5 game losing streak into the Lioerty Bowl, will meet: Georgia Tech at Memphis, Tennessee. In local hockey, the Aeros and the Los Angeles Sharks of the World Hockey Association, battled to a 4-4 tie. Now, for page one news. The outlook for a quick peace settlement in Vietnam has taken an apparent turn for the worse. The Hanoi government radio announced last night that U.S. planes have dropped more mines in Haiphong Harbor and has also carried out bombing and rocket attacks on the City of Haiphong. There was no immediate comment from Washington on the charges!. The snag in the Paris peace talks apparently hinges on a few key points, according to press association reports. Among then, the North Vietnamese will not accept the idea of two separate Vietnamese states, and the method of policing a truce. The two Vietnam policy being the major scumbling block. The weather here is making news. Yesterday's reading at Intercontinental Airport was a frigid 22 degrees. Downtown Houston was 32. The airport reading was the lowest since 1932. Up north in the upper midwest and northeast, it's going to be a white Christmas, and more snow is moving into the area. Chicago had a low of 5 above, Sunday, Kansas City 19, and Albuquerque 18. Anne Armstrong, long a power in Texas Republican politics, is reportedly, about to be ramed to a high post in the Nixon Administration. Harry Truman still clings to life. The 88-year-old Presi - 88-year-old former President is holding his own, according to his doctors. Debris, found floating in the Gulf of Mexico, off the west coast of Florida, has been identified as that of a Coast Guard helicopter that crashed. Earlier the chopper had rescued 4 fishermen from a sinking shrimp trawler. The heicopter was headed back to St. Petersburg when it went down with the four fishermen and the crew of four. It's a lot safer up there where you are than on the Texas highways. The State iiighway Patrol reported a high number of serious accidents on Texas roads this weekend. A Houston newspaper reports that industrial demand for Trinity River system water will not produce enough money to finance the project and that the City of Houston's water and industrial district funds will have to make up the difference. Meanwhile, the Clear Lake City Water Authority is tossing around a proposal that would require developers to pay 50 percent of the cost of all lateral water and sewer lines.

We're just wondering if maybe you don't have the better material at your hands there than we've got down here as far any conclusions or preliminary estimates might be.
|SC|Okay, I just thought that you guys may have had some new ideas. We had a good briefing last night with Gordy on the surface experiments. I guess we might want to be updated on the orbital experiments, if there's anything new. And new geology, I guess they got it figured for it but I thought they might have had some new ideas or something along that line.
|CAPCOM|Well, I'm sure they do and I don't mean to short change our geology backroom, Jack, but on the other hand, I think really we're just waiting to get the answers from you or tag up maybe their thoughts with you.

We wouldn't want you to fool with that at all because it's probably all full of dirt and everything, but if you didn't - then the outlet to the cabin fan area might be a central place.
|SC|Uh, let's see, we installed that the first day out I think. And it's been on there every since.
|CAPCOM|Yes, we assumed you did. I just was try ing to cover all bases, here. Okay, the last 3 items — I think you've actually called one of them - are down in the lower equipment bay. One of them is the crack just below panel 101 - down in the lower equipment bay - I think you called that one the first night didn't you?
|SC|Not below 101, huh uh.
|CAPCOM|Okay our pictures show a crevice be low 101, and also while you're right there, I don't think it's even - there's a crevice above the door for the optics stowage area, you might check up in there. It might have lodged -And also, while you're right there, Ron. Our picture, of course, shows your hoses stowed and they kind of come out right there to the right of panel 120 -- the optics stowage area. And so you've got some area behind those panel - behind those hoses and that where it might have lodged, but I believe you had to move those in order to do your EVA yesterday anyway.
|SC|Yes, the hoses in the tunnel have all been moved around in here as far as the hoses are concerned. I still think that the biggest possibility is right above the optics stowage, and that's what I was talking about before. Because it's about - oh, an inch - you know, a crack is at least an inch deep in there and as long as the optics stowage thing itself,
|CAPCOM|Okay, arid - let me - we had one more recommendation for you. And then, over panel 250, there's a little bitty opening - it shows in the pictures - over p ane1 25 0. Okay, we'll check that in a second here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 11:22 GET 278:29 1005/2
278:29:00|CAPCOM|Our only thoughts, Ron, on the - any other position that you might see - you know if it's above the couch plane and you really think it might be a suspect area, you might consider taping the crack, if you desire. The tape probably isn t going to nold it in if it wants to come tumbling out, but it's something you could do if you wanted to.
|SC|Okay, I understand that Bob. That's a good point.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, while we're talking to you, we'd like to tag up with you on one more item unrelated to the scissors search and that is your headset situation. And we just want to leave the - make sure you're going to do as we said last night and will not plug that headset with the broken wire you will not plug in again and we'll arrange your entry configuration in some configuration that does not require that headset to be plugged in. Is that affirm?
|SC|Yes, that's affirm, Bob. I'll buy that. What I'll do, ±'11 wear it as a bump hat - you know - and then use the light weight headset with the - you know the earplugs underneath that. Put the light weight headset around my neck, and then have the mike sticking up in front of me, and with the ear plugs on under - I tested that particularly, and it's comfortable and no problem, and it'll work. But I will not plug in the comm carrier at all.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we just wanted to tag up with you on that - that's what we'll be expecting and we'll put this to bed f o re ve r.
|SC|Okay, mighty fine.

|CAPCOM|Go ahead, America.
|SC|Okay, Bcb, we got the major compartments inventoried and stowed frankly with the exception of the things we need, of course, between now and then in the sleeping areas and what have you. We'll finish that off, of course, as we finish up with gear and as we get up in the morning. But there's very little left to do and any contingency weight changes, which there; may be just a couple at the most, we'll inventory those and give them to you in the morning.

|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|I've got an interesting little press release here. Jack Schmitt, and I'm sure all of you will be interested in. Based upon your work up in the Shorty area, on the surface, the people out of Flagstaff, went back and looked at the Apollo 14, 250 millimeter camera. And frames from - and showed that it had colored frames that showed brownish and orangeish colorations on a bulbous dome in the Crater Langrenus, and on a 4-kilometer dark halo crater on the ejecta blanket of Cilopidus, and they've made that news release today.
|SC|Very good. We may have triggered something.
|CAPCOM|Yes sir..
|SC|Okay Bob, I'm on that maneuver.
|CAPCOM|America., we'd like OMNI DELTA.
|SC|You have OMNI DELTA now, Bob,
|CAPCOM|17, Houston. OMNI ALFA.
|SC|You've got it.

|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CAPCOM|America, you can go to Auto on the high gain.
|SC|Y ou got i t.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, America.
|SC|Okay, we might be 5 or 10 minutes late on -on starting the ALFMED, we're still putting some sensors on.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Hello, Bob .
|CAPCOM|Yes.
|SC|Can you get a reading - is it the same two subjects on ALFMED as we had going out, or is this a case where you want it1on all three of us. It's not exactly clear.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 12:36 CST 279:43 GET MCI009/1
279:43:00|CAPCOM|Jack, we agree with you that it's not clear and FAO tells us we want two - the same two subjects wearing the blindfold as on the transearth codes as was on the translunar codes.
|SC|Okay. All this has been chained and that's the way we'll do it.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene.
|SC|Houston, this is Jack.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Yeah, we've got pretty good COMM attitude here. Ask FAO if they want them on VOX and if they also want the notes recorded up here.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll check on that.
|CAPCOM|The easiest way to do it would be just go ahead and do it on VOX and we'll get everything recorded down here,
|SC|I agree because taking notes is good when you're having drop outs but it's hardly the same as tapes.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative and since you do have - you're locked up on COMM and high-gain and that, just go ahead and we'll record it all down here for you.
|SC|Okay .
|CAPCOM|Jack, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|This is your option, Jack, but if you want to you can put the other set of blindfolds out and see what you see too. And box and give us the data.
|SC|Roger. Maybe I will. What the problem is, though is that I noticed that one things start going with 2 they were starting to interfere and 3 might do the same thing.
|CAPCOM|Okay, your option.
|SC|I may put them on anyway.
|CAPCOM|It's your option and no problem.
|SC|I may put them on just to watch.

|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Roger. Would you ask the surgeon to check to see if the command module pilot is alive and well?
|CAPCOM|Okay, there's seeing data. It looks sort of squirly and - but it looks - they want it to settle down for a little while.
|SC|- Critical, part.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 GET 279:53 CST 1246 MC-1010/1
279:53:00|SC|Got to unplug that there.
|SC|Yeah, I'm ready.
|SC|Okay, Bob, CDR and CMP have got their blind folds on.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|I got it.
|SC|Okay, we're starting.
|SC|Houston, this is Ron. While we're getting a darkened atmosphere, probably won't see anything for a while, let me just record on the tape my impression of these light flashes as they occurred around the Moon and at other times. In general, they've all been essentially - as I said a flash, with little bit of a glow, and usually in one eye or the other eye and for some reason both generally they've been kind of - you don't want to say it's in the periphery of your vision because you get the feeling that maybe there was a flash over to the left or down to the right or something like that. But you don't get a distinct impression as to where the flash came from. Well, you can see where it came from, but not - you can't see the flash itself. Like it was just bayond your vision; and both of them have been like that. At one time, and one time only throughout the flight I can remember kind of a triple flash, so to speak. And in that case, there was a bright flash in the left eye on -about 10 o'clock in the left eye. And then it repeated itself again about 2 o'clock in the left eye. And then about, oh, 10 o'clock, a quarter of the way out, in the right eye. I just started a bink, bink, bink just like that. Three of them right in a row. And the rest of the time, though, they've all essentially been single flashes to me.
|SC|This is Gene here. I'll just remark that both Jack and I did seen them on the lunar surface. I guess the best summation I can make of that is I think I saw both lines and then the spots or the flashes a little bit more sharply, but that might be because of the adaptation - dark adaptation in the LM prior to going to sleep was probably a little bit better. And I guess it's awful hard to tell time when you're under - when it's dark, and it's my guess, I want to say they were quite frequent and I'd say that means two to three a minute now. That could be way out, but that's what I'd guess.

280:23:00|CAPCOM|America to Houston. We haven't heard anything. Have you seen any flashes at all?
|SC|Haven't heard a - haven't seen a thing, Bob. Can't understand it. Same here from the CDR. I haven't seen anything.
|CAPCOM|Roger. I understand. Your heart rates are down pretty low — like maybe you fell asleep or something.
|SC|Oh, no. The LMP dozed a couple cf times but - I thought I saw one, Bob, but, I'm not sure. I squinted hard about that time. I may have just triggered something.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Okay, we're just standing by.
|SC|The last time wewere in PTC, were we not?
|CAPCOM|Yes you were and that's one reascn you had to copy it down because we kept losing COMM on yo u.
|SC|As I recall, they seemed to come in batches when - when I was taking notes. Is that what: you people observed? Or recorded, rather.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative, Jack, and the thought that occurs, of course, is that you may be blocking with shielding on the spacecraft somehow.
|SC|Houston, has my biomed settled down?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|SC|Okay.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 13:30 CST 280:37 GET MC1013/1
280:37:00|SC|No, I haven't been able to see any flashes. I rotated 180 degrees along the rotation axis along Z and saw no change - LMP.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. The light flash observation is up and we'd like to move on into the flight plan. And this call - it is for Ron -
|SC|Hey Robert.
|CAPCOM|The EMS entry check is on at 281 as shown. We'd like you to do that now prior to the maneuver which is at 281 or delay it until about 281:50 when you're not maneuvering. We'd like to do that check when you are not in — not maneuvering.
|SC|I'll go ahead and do it now.
|SC|What's going up here? Going up here. Which is supposed to go up first?
|CAPCOM|You can do it now. You've got about 5 minutes prior to the VERB 49 maneuver.
|SC|Bob.
|SC|Up in the. EMS check. Okay, why don't1 you go over it now.
|SC|Your eyes all right?
|SC|Put off a chance to open your eyes. Ye ah .
|SC|That must be something, the fact that we'didn't even see a flash.
|CAPCOM|It would probably tell you that there's a point source and the spacecraft that's blocking it somehow.
|SC|Or the Earth. Or the Moon, I believe it.
|CAPCOM|0 yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't want to get technical. Something's blocking them, that's right.
|SC|(laughter) Why should we even have seen them, I can't wave at - at them. Okay, Ron, why don't you go ahead and do that, huh? I just put mine up.
|SC|Okay, I'm on page 1-3 and the EMS function is off. Circuit breakers are closed. EMS mode to standby. And function to test 5 - or test 1. EMS to NORMAL.
|SC|Okay, the hairline is over the notch or the test pattern and it's test pattern number 4. Okay, 05 G light came on on test 2. Go to test 3. Okay, it's 10 seconds and the down light came on. Okay, it should be 8 .0 in the range counter there. Okay, test 4 — she's counting down and the trace went down. Going straight along. Mark it. 10 seconds. 0.0. How about that. And it stops at the lower right hand corner of the page. Okay, with test 5, trace went up and 10 sec later the upper light came on.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 GET 280:57 CST 1350 MC-1014/1
280:57:00|SC|Okay, we'll go to range center. And let tne (Garble) cool down a little bit. And the trace moves on up to zero. It looks like it worced good, Houston.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Sounds great.
|SC|Okay, we'll go standby and off.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Just some words for Ron, when he gets into the P20 option 2 the maneuver there, was tried on the simulator and it got out to 71 degrees on the middle gimbal angle. And it got a gimbal warning light, although 71 degrees is the maximum yaw angle they got.
|SC|Okay, we'll try it.
|SC|Bob, for your recorded information there, mag Tango, Tango on the 35 millimeter camera frames, let's see, 8 through 13 have the ALFMED prime observer position data on them.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we've got it recorded.
|CAPCOM|Just is another piece of data, guys, on this maneuver you're in right now, it should go out to a 67 degree middle gimbal angle right to this maneuver.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We'd like to close UV cover until we're in attitude now.
|SC|Okay, we'll close the cover.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 14:05 GET 281:15 1015/1
281:15:00|SC|Okay, cover is closed.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|Houston, this is America. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we've got a procedure we'd like to go through to eventually pu: the ECS radiator's flow control over to AUTO and we have a bunch - several steps we'd like to go through before you do that move.
|SC|Okay, wait a minute, I'll write them down here so we can -
|CAPCOM|Roger, are you ready to read it or copy i t ?
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, on panel 5 the ECS radiators control ler circuit breaker ACl, verified CLOSED. Panel 2 ECS radiator's flow controller to position 1. ECS radiators flow control power to OFF center, then power. Wait 20 seconds. ECS radiator's flow control to AUTO. Over.
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Do you suspect it was a power glitch or do you think the controller actually failed, and you're just going to verify it?
|CAPCOM|Negative on either of those cases. We've just had lots of spurious changes in the past history on flights. John's sitting here saying you had a number of times on 10, and so, since we're not, we just think the power controller probably saw a temperature glitch or something and we think it will just come right back - no problem.
|SC|I - come to think of it - I guess we'did, now that he recalls it.
|CAPCOM|Would you like OMNI CHARLIE?
|SC|Okay, OMNI CHARLIE.
|CAPCOM|And while you're there we'd like the UV cover to OPEN, now.
|SC|Okay, we'll open the UV cover.
|SC|Okay, Houston. I'm ready to proceed on this PITCH maneuver.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|And Houston. The readback on the flow controller, there. . We'll check panel 5, ECS radiator control circuit breaker ACl verified CLOSED, then we'll put the ECS flow controller to position number 1. And we'll turn the ECS flow controller power OFF at center.
|CAPCOM|It's off center, Ron, and then up the power.
|SC|Okay, I couldn't figure out my writing, okay, that's right, the powers off center and then back to power, then wait 20 seconds and put the ECS flow controller on AUTO.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 14:05 GET 281:13 1015/2
281:13:00|SC|Houston,, America. You want to start that n ow ?
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative,, Any time. And in case you're wondering about that middle step, that's a reset and a logic step by going off on the power and then back to power.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, ECS flow controller is going to posi tion 1, okay ECS power is OFF, and then back to power. And we're waiting 20 seconds - okay flow controller is going to AUTO now and stays gray - it looks like.
|CAPCOM|That's what we expected. And needless to say, Ron. We'll be watching; your ECS system very carefully for you just in case it flips bs.ck - we'don't expect any problem
|SC|Okay, mighty fine.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 14:17 GET 281:24 MC-1016/1
281:24:00|CAPCOM|And America Houston. I've got a midcourse 7 and a mid-pac entry pad.
|SC|Okay. Just say one please.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|And, An.erica, Houston. We'd like to bring up the high-gain, so we can get the dump going and get the data down, it's a Yaw plus 15, Pitch 204. Say again Pitch plus 15, Yaw, 204.
|SC|Okay, pitch 15 Yaw 204.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead, America.
|SC|Okay, I assume this line in here stop Pitch rate at 146 degrees means stop at 146 degrees in pitch, is that correct?
|CAPCOM|Rog. Stop at 146 degrees pitch.
|SC|Okay, thank you.
|SC|You've got the high-gain, which you haven't told us, Bob.
|CAPCOM|And, America, Houston. I've also, besides these pads, I've also got a flight plan update for the first one item 282:10, either one you want to take first.
|SC|Okay, why don't you go ahead with the flight plan update first.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Gene. At 282:10 manually, manual roll left 40 degrees, fire to the VERB 49 maneuver. Insert manual roll left 40 degrees. That'll give you a roll angle of 342, prior to starting that maneuver,
|SC|Okay, I've got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the next one's quite a ways over. It's at 284:55.
|SC|Okay, I've got it.
|CAPCOM|Okay, first thing at 284:55, we'd like a VERB 48, first register, 11102, second register 01111,
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|A VERB 49 maneuver to lunar sounder thermal attitude at 28500, the attitude is Pitch 122, say again, roll 122, Pitch 065, Yaw 047, That's 122 065 and 047. High-gain angles with that will be pitch minus 24, Yaw 160.
|SC|Okay. At 28500 49 to roll of 122, pitch 065, yaw 047, high-gain is minus 24 and 160.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Sene. And then at 285:10 where we had you right in the antenna retrack, we want you to delete that. The purpose of the maneuver above that is to heat up those antennas and we will retract them on a cue from us, when we reel the temperatures are warm enough1'
|SC|Okay, wnat about the radar off set point.
|CAPCOM|Delete, radar off, also.
|SC|Okay, I've deleted the whole update at 285: 10 I had.

|SC|Okay.
|SC|Houatoiij here's the crew of Apollo — Apollo 17, Spaceship America. C^.?s.0M1Roger, Apollo 17. If you're ready for the quebtioningj I'll begin.
|SC|Go ahead, Gordo. CAP uOii1Okav . As usual in these inflight news conferencesj the questions that will be asked of you were prepared by correspondents covering the Apollo 17 mission at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, They will be read exactly as written and in the order determined by the newsmen. The first question is for Jack Schmitt. If you, as a geologist, were coining home from a field trip on Earth, you'd be drafting a preliminary report and discussing it with fellow geologists. in terms understandable to laymen, can you summarize what you wouid be saying in your preliminary report about your field crip to Taurus-Littrow?
|SCHMITT|Well, I'll -- I'll give that a try, Gordie. I think the cning we had hoped to accomplish at Taurus-Littrow was to look at a — as broad a spectrum of the history of the iiooa as possible in one small area, as the concluding flight to the Apollo Program, And, I think we'did that. I think we nad look — did look at some of the oldest rocks that it is possible to see with our capability in the breccias of the south and North Massifs. i think, we s aw some intermediate age rocKS of rairly unexpected character, I. believe, and the subfloor crystalline or igneous rocks, the gabbro, as we called them there* and we also understood, I think, that those rocks s in fact, had intruded into the breccias of the North Massif. We found, I believe, in the -- at the Crater Van Serg, on the third EVA, that the regolith, or the garden zone, on the top of that subfioor gabbro, or the igneous rocks, was quite thick, or appears to be very thi^k, which is an expected result, and we'll -- hopefully, those rocks will have much in r ormacion toout a fairly extended period of lunar erosion. And, we to unci that tr, ere was indeed a dark mantle over the area ot1learned there was indeed a dark man tie over the area ot variable thic.cness , but, apparently, of relatively recent ige, anc that in turn had a light mantle of material of which we co not yet understand, and I think that the s&vnp 1 es are going to have to tell that story. It may well be a lane APOLLO 17 TV CGNF. FROM CSM L2/18/72 CST 17:00 GET 284:06 MC1024/2 slide that has come off the South Massif. And, th en, possibly as important as any finding, we found tiat even later than that relatively young light mantle deposit are avalanche possible avalanche -- we hava alteration reminiscent of the alteration by hot waters or not gasses or Earth, and that was the orange — appears to be the orange soil that we found around the crater Shorty. And, subsequently, in orbit we started to pick up, and particularly through Ron Evans' efforts, pick up more and more of the apparent evidence of such alteration taking place in fairly recent time on the Moon. All of those items, I think, are extremely significant and go through the full range of our present knowledge of lunar history. And, a report I would write would initially summarize that particular sequence of events.
|CAPCOM|Question number 2 is for Jack, again. What other probable explanations besides volcanic origin do you have for the orange rock and colored soil that you found at Shorty Crater?
|SCHMITT|Well, they don't necessarily have to be volcanic, Gordie. I refer to them as alteration, and much of the hydrothermal, or hot water, alteration we see on Earth is related to recent volcanism, or ancient volcanism, but, also, we know of that kind of alteration of preexisting materials to take place as a result of just fluids working their way up through the Earth's crust, and I presume that such a process is also possible on the Moon. The ones we saw seem to be associated with areas of dark mantle of various types, and most of the photographic evidence we have is of those dark mantle deposits are associated with volcanism, but it is not necessarily proved yet, I believe, that the -- the orange soils or the alterations we've seen are volcanic. However, the process would be a related process, that is, one of the tunnel origin,
|CAPCOM|The third question is for Cernan or Schmitt. Your voices are so much alike that it is unclear to some of us which one of you found the orange rock and who first spotted the layer of orange soil on the crater rim.
|CERNAN|Jack found it. He uncovered it as he was walking on the rim, and we worked with that, and then, I went around the crater to take the Stereo base pan from within the crater, I could see alterations (garble) down from the rim further beyond where we were working down to the center. I don't think that that question of who found it is specifically as important as that that we were there with the equipment and the training jointly to not only recognize that, but to take advantage of having recognized it, and I hope that we'did.
|CAPCOM|Okay. The next one's for Ron Evans. Why do you think you were able to see so much orange material APOLLO 17 TV CONF. FROM CSM 12/18/72 CST 17:00 GET 284:06 MC1024/3 from lunar orbit after your partners had found some on the ground where none of the previous Apollo crews reported seeing anything but greys, tans, and browns?
|EVANS|Well, I think, for one thing, that we were in, essentially, a different orbit than some of the other crews that had been up there before. And, you know, each of us has a color tone in our own eyes. What we come up with, I think, is a function pretty much of what you'd like to believe and what you'd like to see out of things. If you feel it has a tint of orange with it, and this is in a new area that we really haven't flown over that much, and this is primarily -- where we were seeing this type of thing was on the western rim of Serenitatis, and some of the -well, it leads — it looks like known volcanic deposits along the rim of Serenitatis.
|SC|Gor —
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 17:10 CST 284:16 GET 1025/1
284:16:00|SC|Gordy, let me add quickly that there's no such thing as a truly objective observer and I believe chat once you start looking for something, and when Ron heard about what we were doing, I'm sure he started looking; himself, to see what we had seen. That leads you to see things. Now that's not seeing things that are not there, it makes you look for things that are there and that's extremely important and that's where the kind of training all three of us have had and I think this made it possible for us to find a lot of things that might not otherwise have been found.
|CAPCOM|Here's one addressed to all three crewmen. What will you remember most about this mission?
|SC|Boy, that's a loaded question, Gordie.
|SC|There's a - so many things but I think probably the thing that - when I think about it - that will stick with me most is the same thing that stuck with me - a for my last two missions - not so much being there, but it's getting the chance to get home and share what you've seen and what you've done with other people.
|SC|I think in my case, the lift-off itself was something brand new for me. It's something beyond -the booster ride itself was something beyond what I could humanly comprehend. So, I think that's - a - oh - it's a very important part of it. I will always remember that part of it. But I'm kinda like with Gene, I feel that even though the three of us had been up here and had the opportunity to observe the Moon, look at what we could find and that type of thing, I think that we have an obligation to share our experiences with the rest of the people.
|SC|Well, Gordy, that is a difficult question. It has been a fascinating experience from so many detail aspects. I guess generally speaking the thing I carry back with me, I hope, is an increased perspective not only for the history of the solar system, but I hope for the future of mankind with in that solar system.
|SC|Gordy, this doesn't mean that that last 50 000 feet won't stick in my mind for a long time.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Gene. Again for all three crewmen. Now that you are returning home from what may be the last lunar exploration of this century, what short range and long range plans do each of you have for the future?
|SC|Well my short range plans are certainly to enjoy Christmas with my family. Ah, think about the flight, get it's data down on paper. My long range plans are to turn around and look at the r.ext flight whenever that: may be and put my efforts anc experience toward that flight and get to wo rk on it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 17:10 CST 284:16 GET 1025/2
284:16:00|SC|I think my short range plans, of course first of all tomorrow I want to make a real good reentry, and that's kinda the real short range part of it. From that point on, as I mentioned before, I think we have a responsibility , at least I feel we have responsibilities, to share our experiences with the rest of the people not only in the United States, but with the people of the rest of the world. Beyond that I also have a strong desire to continue participating in manned space flights in whatever capacity that I might be able to.
|SC|Well, I can do nothing but echo Gene and Ron's words and maybe add, Gordy, that I hope that through the next few years I'll be able to make some contributions, that guarantees that this Apollo flight is not the last exploration program in this century in space.
|CAPCOM|Again for all the crew. Throughout the mission there were periodic reports from each of you about gastric distress in one form or another. Does this tiouble make you think that the three skylab missions of 28, 56 and 56 days scheduled for next year are to ambitious?
|SC|No, not at all. I don't think they are to ambitious, Gordy. I think that's the reason we're flying each and everyone of these flights one at a time. To find out if there really are potential problems in diet or what have you. And I think we solved a lot of them from Apollo 15 and 16 and those few that we had I'm sure we can solve accordingly prior to Skylab flying.
|SC|I don't think I can add anything to that.
|SC|I think we've made a big improvement over the problems that occurred on Apollo 16 and I think as a result of our observations in conjunction with the medical people, primarily NASA, that solution — a clear solution will be found for Skylab and any other mission we want to fly.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Ron Evans. You seemed almost euphoric during your space walk yesterday and other space walkers before you seemed to have had this same reaction to1: the experience. Can you describe what xt was like and how it made you feel?
|SC|Well I think for those of you who had the opportunity to watch yesterday, it is pretty obvious how I felt out there. I'm not sure euphoric if the word. I -it's an opportunity - well to me I guess it was an opportunity to be what I call a "real space man . And - you re out there in the deepness of space, there's nothing there but your spacesuit on and you're doing the job that has to be done. And we're riding around in space out here, and this is in a capsule and we look out th e window you know, but it s a nice firm feeling it's a solidly built vehicle and you get the zero g effect on the thing, but you don't get the feeling of -really getting out and walking in space. And once I became accustomed to what it was like in the EVA environment, then you relax and you take it easy, you try to accomplish what you can and observe what you can and really enjoy it. And I think really enjoyed it.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 17:10 CST 284:16 GET 1025/3
284:16:00|SC|I had a hold of his umbilical most of that time and I didn't notice that he was ready to jump out into space if that's the kind of euphoria you're talking about.
|CAPCOM|Okay. For Eugene Cernan and any other later comments. You talked a lot about this mission being the end of the beginning, but a lot of people don't agree. Recognizing the United States is stopping lunar exporation in the forseeable future, how do you feel?
|SC|When we look back at the Apollo program I don't think anyone can privately to themselves and publicly say that this truly indeed has really been a beginning -a beginning of man's really first venture out into deep space. And once there's a beginning, there's a continuation. The probing into deep space by man, the next landing on the Moon, a trip to Mars may not be for 10 years, a decade; it may not be until the end of this centry. But I personally have faith it will happen. I think it's a restraint, an abnormal restraint of man's intellect at this point in time to restrict or tend to think that he will restrict his own feeling of . exploration. His own quest for knowledge. He's had an opportunity. He's proved th a. t he could t ak e advantage of this opportunity and I think that's the nature of mankind is going to just press on. That's why I believe not probably Apollo 17, yes, it's a beginning; but the whole Apollo program is really the true beginning of what's to come in the future. And I firmly believe that. We can look back in a hundred i years or two hundred years ar.d the five year or ten year period of time, we may be slowed down here. I think we'll be - we'll be lost in the merit of what is really accomplished during the next several decades.
|CAPCOM|The next question is for all the crew. The American people seem to be getting i:airly blase about space flights and television coverage o J: Apollo 17 has been at a minimum. But this is not the case aboard. For example, in the Republic of Zaire, the former Belgian Congo, an estimated 20 million people are watching extensive coverage on ^ TV sets set-up in the villages. What do you have to say to the people of underdeveloped nations?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 17:10 CST 284:16 GET 1025/4
284:16:00|SC|Well, Gordy, first of all I'm not sure that the amount of television coverage is necessarily a measure of the interest of the American people. I don't have those figures at hand. I'm sorry to hear that the adventures we had and the insight that maybe we gained into not only ourselves, but to the history of the solar system was not shared extensively with the American people, if that's true. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, and also the people of the United States who may not participate as much in the affluence that: we all would like to share, I think that what space flight in general and Apollo Program in particular has offered, is many new avenues from which we can provide for those people abroad and for our own people, the kind of quality of life and the material - including the material quality of life that everybody aspires to. I think we've just begun the adventure of understanding how what we've learned and how we've learned to do it in space can be applied to these particular kinds of problems. That is one of the great challenges that I think NASA and other agencies within the United States Government and other Governments abroad have, is to use this base of technological information now for there own people.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 17:21 GET 284:28 1026/1
284:28:00|SC|I'd like to just add to that very briefly, Gordie that America has led the way into space in the past. I believe we will in the future. But, a point I tried to get across several days earlier in the flight is that the real promise of the future for all the people of the Earth is to weld themselves into a coherent group of people who can live and work together and then enjoy all the benefits and all the knowledge that is to come from future space explorations. I think we are doing this not just as Americans but as human beings and everyone throughout these countries throughout the world who are watching us right now are also human beings no different than we are. It's their accomplishment as well as it is ours.
|CAPCOM|Question 11 is for Jack. Do you think the United States waited too long to send a geologist to the Moon.-
|SC|We're grinning because I think we pre dicted that question. Gordie, I think the United States waited too long to go into space in the first place and I think their probably going to wait too long to go back. I will always feel that way no matter who goes or what qualifications he may have or may think he has. I think that the most important thing that maybe I have done is to — to be able to show that we can build a transportation system that allows you to fly people over a wide variety of discipline. And I think that we have shown that and I think that it's occurred at about as soon as possible within the Apollo program.
|CAPCOM|The last couple of questions are in lighter vein and for Ron Evans. There has been a lot of discussion about missing pair of scissors in the command module. Who really lost the scissors?
|SC|Well, I think it must have been one of those other guys because I was asleep and I got up the next morning and it was gone.
|SC|Didn't happen on my watch.
|CAPCOM|And also Ron did the squeaking of those mice onboard keep you awake?
|SC|No, the mice really didn't - there are plenty of other things going on inside the spacecraft here that we can hardly even hear the mice. As a matter of fact I really haven't heard them yet.-
|CAPCOM|Okay, this completes the list of questions submitted by the newsmen here in Houston. There are a little less than 7 minutes left on our scheduled time for any other further remarks you might like to make.
|SC|Yes, Gordie I think we'd like to take this opportunity to each say a word or two.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 17:21 GET 284:28 1026/2
284:28:00|SC|Well, just briefly Gordie I feel that I have done something that's very significant here ir. my life. I hope that - and will do everything I can to see that it is not the most significant thing I ever do. But, I feel that the fact that I had the opportunity .to do in a large part to the tangible and intangible affects that my mother and father had on my life and to them I send my thanks and I hope that I continue to live up to their expectations.
|SC|You know on Apollo 17 here we've had two outstanding vehicles and that's the - don't let me get you wrong I'm not just trying to boost her either. But, I've watched a lot of people work on a lot of spacecraft and I'm very proud to be able to say that all the vehicles that have been associated with Apollo 17 have been outstanding. And, the reason they are outstanding is because the people have been working on them. And,, I'd like to give our thanks and the well done to people who worked on our sapcecraft.
|SC|Gordie, prior to leaving and I guess I can certainly assume during the flight we've carried many many well wishes and vary many prayers aboard from people throughout the world. I personally believe that those prayers played no small part in any success that we were able to achieve on this flight. I asked those people however to continue their prayers and particularly for some of our friends and some of our comrades who are still in southeast Asia POW's MIA's who may rot although God's willing I hope, but who may not have the opportunititis to get home and enjoy the Christmas that we're looking forward to. And, with that from Apollo 17 spacecraft America on December 18, 1972 we all wish you a very very merry Christinas and a happy holiday season. God speed and God bless you all.

|CAPCOM|I think you can just leave it alone. It is holding some during the maneuver and should hold until the end of it.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|The maneuver's over Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Rog.
|SC|Now we're even.
|SC|Hello Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. With these relatively fixed attitudes most of the afternoon, we got the, the tunnel totally dry, but the forward hatch is awful wet. I just thought I'd throw that out.
|CAPCOM|Okay.

284:59:00|PAO|This is Apollo control at 2 85 hours 14 minutes. At the presen': time in mission control we've got a group of engineers from the crew systems division clustered around the capcom console going over a set of recommended procedures which capcom Gordon Fullerton will be discussing with Ron Evans for fixing his communications carrier the so called Snoopy hat that the crew wears that has the earphones and microphone attachments built In, Evans reported several days ago :hat the comm carrier - communications carrier was intermittant and last night he took it apart looked inside and found that in fact a couple of wires had broken and made a temporary fix. The procedures that we'll be reading up to him are to ensure that so far as possible that the Snoopy hat communications carrier is fixed up to work properly during entry, If for some reason the Snoopy hat carrier couldn't be used Evans would plan to wear the light weight headset using the Snoopy hat to hold it in position but the preferable arrangement during entry would be to have a working comm carrier built into the Snoopy hat. Apollo 17 at this time is 93 270 nautical miles from Earth. And the speed is 5 444 feet per second,
|SC|Houston America iyou're ready we'll man euve r.
|CAPCOM|Stand by we're checking. Not yet tempera tures aren't up as high as they would like them. We'd like to hold five minutes at least,
|SC|Okay, we'll just stand by for you call on the maneuver,
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo control at 2 85 hours 24 minutes. Here in mission control we're at the present time being paid a visit by a jolly gentleman in red cap and coat with white whiskers who is going around the room dispensing things from a bag of goodies.
|PAO|For flight director Chuck Lewis out of Santa's bag is a toy flight: directors console for Skylab complete with spinners. A can of Skylab food for capcom Gordon Fullerton.
|CAPCOM|America Houston.
|SC|Go ahead, Houston.
|CAPCOM|You guys aren't going to believe this, but Santa Claus just walked in the MOCR with a long white beard, red suit, black boots and all and he's passing out presents to everybody.
|SC|How die. he get there before we'do. We just saw him up there about five; days ago.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 17:51 GET 284:59 1028/2
284:59:00|CAPCOM|Well, he beat you back.
|SC|Gordie, I'd believe anything. Has he got anything with1our name on it?
|CAPCOM|I'll ask him I don't see anything yet.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/82 GET 285:00 CST 18:20 MC1029/1
285:00:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. You can go ahead and start the V49 maneuver. Have a change in the high gain angles, though, as printed there. Make it a plus 30 and 190, instead of minus 40 and 90. That's a plus 30 and 190 on the high gain,
|SC|Okay, I got a birdie.
|PAO|Flight Surgeon, John Ziegelschmitt, received a small telephone for private conversations out of Santa's bag,
|SC|Gordy, when you get a minute, would you ask one of the surgeons there what my heart rate peaked out at in the last 15 minutes or so.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll do that. I'm just looking at some of the presents here. Mine was a little Skylab flute can, flip top can, says CAPCOM's post flight dinner. I'm pretty sure there's absolutely nothing in it, but I'm afraid to pull the lid off. The surgeon's got a little plastic telephone that says "For Private Conversations ONLY".
|SC|(Laughter).
|CAPCOM|And your heart rate went to ...
|SC|I'd be more worried about what might be ...
|CAPCOM|Your heart ...
|SC|You ought to be more worried about what might be in that can, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Yes, I am. Geno's heart rate peaked at 115 to 120.
|SC|Okay, what did the LMP's peak at. He wasn't doing anything.
|SC|I'm not; even on Biomed, as a matter of fact, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Oh I'm sorry. My mistake. Not the surgeon's. That was the LMP's. Stoval, on the front there, got a little shovel like gadget, with a sign on it that says "Trenching Tool".
|SC|Beautiful.
|SC|I thought they might give him a coin. A flippable coin.
|CAPCOM|He's got a coin like that. It says "CSM Active" on both sides.
|SC|That's what I figured.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We're ready for a spin up now .
|SC|Okay.
|SC|We're spinning, Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Okay. It's looking good.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 GET 285:54 CST 18:46 MC1030/1
285:54:00|CAPCOM|Americas Houston. We'd like to throw a few switches on panel 230 and try to get the HF antennas retracted. Ove r.
|SC|Okay. Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay. First of all, radar OFF.
|SC|Okay, Gordy, the radar is OFF.
|CAPCOM|Okay them HF antenna Number 2, retract and give us a mark please. It should take about, little over 2 minutes .
|SC|Okay, going to retract. Mark it,. Oh, HF2? Gordy, I started 1. I'm sorry.
|CAPCOM|That's allright. Keep it. It doesn't matter, just keep working on 1 there. Keep it in retract.
|SC|Okay, it's in retract and stayed there.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. As you come up on roll of 30, we'd like you to, okay, break, break, we would like the antenna 1 switched to OFF now.
|SC|It is off,
|CAPCOM|And we got a good retract. Okay, for the guy on the . ,
|SC|Gordy?
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|It was still barber pole when I went to OFF.
|CAPCOM|Okay, that's the one we had trouble with before. That's what we expected. Okay you can go number 2 to ret rac t n ow.
|SC|Okay, number 2 retract. Mark.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and for whoever is driving the space ship there, we'd like to step the roll, stop the PTC at a roll angle of 30, instead of what's in the Flight Plan. That's 30 degrees and you're passing through 73 right now. Over.
|SC|Okay, Gordy. I got it. I'm looking at N0UN 20. We'll stop it at 30.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I have different high gains to go with that attitude. They'll be minus 24 and 206.
|SC|Okay. We got them. C aP COM1Jack, Houston. You should be retracting now. Have a gray and you can go OFF as you as you do.
|SC|That's affirmed and congratulations. And the switch is OFF.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and those high gain angles I passed you are probably misleading. It looks like the high gain ought to just hang on when you stop this maneuver.
|SC|Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. It'll be about 5 or 6 minutes until we finish the dump before we can go ahead with the VERB 49, in case you got something to do.

|SC|Okay, Houston. Here she comes.
|SC|America is on her way again.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|Gordo I can see two DAP changes here. You want to change this one during the maneuver or after the maneuver. And then the next1one before the next maneuver.
|CAPCOM|We would want the DAP load, after you get to attitude, and1then the other DAP load before you start the next mane uver.
|SC|Sounds. That sounds good here. Okay.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We need the UV cover closed. The Sun's getting ir. there.

|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|You get to watch tenth of America tonight, then .
|CAPCOM|Okay, captain.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We'd like OMNI alpha.

|CAPCOM|America, Houston, over.
|SC|Go ah e ad.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we've been thinking about: the busted Snoopy hat and have a suggestion on a configuration that we'd like to present to you as an alternative to the plan you mentioned earlier. See what you think about it.
|SC|Hey,Gcrdo.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Can you hold off with that update. Ron's off the headset right now and it'll be a few minutes. I'd like to hear him - hear him hear that.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and just as a brief introduction before he gets on. We're really thinking about let Jack have the broken one - nothing personal Jack but, think that it's probably more important that you and Ron have the all up ones over1'
|SC|Yes, we've already discussed that, but let Ror. talk over with what his plan is; and let's hear yours.
|CAPCOM|Okay, give me a call when your ready. Okay, for food to thought you might think about that we looked at a way of just taping the electronic part oi the light weight headset right to his helmet. It looked pretty good so chew on that one for a while and we'll be back with you and you can come up with your plan. Ci-.P COM1xhat sounds like that's our plan essentially, but I ' _L 1 go through it in case there's anything that either you or us haven't thought of about it.

The1. crew will be conducting some housekeeping activities aboard the spacecraft changing the lithium hydroxide canisters. They have one more eat period before retiring for an 8 hour rest period at 290 hours even. And, we're now showing some 16 hours 45 minutes until Apollo 17 enters Earth atmosphere.

287:40:00|SC|Houston, America. The CMP is in Biomed.
|CAPCOM|Okay, CMP.
|SC|Ve ry good .
|CAPCOM|This probably isn't too good a time to have an emergency. 
|CAPCOM|The reason I say that is we got a big Chinese feast going on here in MOCR.
|SC|Oh, you do? C/iP COM1Had some food brought and everybody 's topping America right now I must admit,
|SC|Oh, oh.
|SC|Houston, America. How's the delivery girl situation there. Is it as good as it used to be? CA.PCOM1Oh yes. Better if anything.
|SC|Outstanding. CAPOM1Ron, I have some words on, our suggestion, probably tne same as what you've done already on rigging up the headsets for, for entry tomorrow anytime you have a free moment to listen.
|SC|Oh, sure. Go ahead. Everybody's just sit ting here right now.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Geno mentioned that you'd already essentially taped the electronic part to your Snoopy hat. I guess, first of all, we're suggesting that you rig this up for Jack and let you have the good one. Just to be sure. And I'll, I'll quickly run through the steps we have. I think maybe this will be the easiest way and you can then listen, and if you've done it already, or if it's mentioned something that you haven't thought of, then we'll at least accomplish a job. They have about fifteen steps here, but I don't think it'll take long to summarize it. They suggest taking the headband off the light—weight headset, in other words taking the electronic part off th2 headband, straighten the mike boom, and straighten the COMM carrier boom, the appropriate one for whichever ear Jack wears his molded ear piece in. Then, rotate the light-weight headset mike boom 90 degrees. They found that was necessary to get it to face your mouth when you end up with this all taped on there, you have to sort of twist it, force it 90 degrees. Then lay the light-weight head set boom along the COMM carrier boom with the electronic part on the outside of your ear piece on the Snoopy hat. And the hose that goes to the molded ear piece facing downward coming out down and with the mike boom 1 inch beyond the COMM carrier mike boom tip. And then tape the two booms together for the entire length oi the COMM carrier boom. And then, re-bend the whole works back so that the tip is back in front of your mouth. And then tape
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 GET 287:40 CST 20:33 MCI034/2
287:40:00|CAPCOM|the electronics box onto the side of the -ear piece and you can run tape all the way around the lower part of the ear piece and you can lift up on the leather-covered doughnuts on the inside th ere, pull that loose and then run tape underneath, just pull the lower part of it loose, run tape a 11 the way around it real—y securely anchor the electronics box to the outside of the, the ear piece, so there's no chance that that will slip off, or shift. Then you can kind of push the leather ear seal back down on top of the tape inside. Le t's s ee, th en . . .
|SC|Yes. So far, so far we're right with you.
|CAPCOM|Okay. Then take the COMM carrier electrical lead and double it back on itself and tape it together so that it doesn t flop around. And now you've got it essentially set up. I've lost my place here in the sequence. Just a second. Okay, place the melded ear piece to, well, actually one further modification was then, to run the hose, which is now external, up underneat the leather doughnut, and out through the ear opening and pull it on through. Now you, to put this all on, you 11 have to stick the molded ear piece in your ear and then as you pull the Snoopy on, sort of pull the slack out of the audio hose there, so you don't end up with a lot of hose coiled up In the ear cup. And the remaining hose then just sort of dangles down beside your neck. Fasten chin strap and make sure that the hose isn't pinched anywhere. Readjust the mike boom to a half inch from your, in front of your lips and make one of the foam parts of the mike boom is facing your mouth. Okay, then you just route the electrical lead and the the plug on down through the slot and the ICG and put, put all the excess length of the connectors and the excess stuff down inside the ECG so it doesn't flop around and of course mate the pins, connectors and snap the ICG closed at the front to be sure that it'll capture. One thing they did try in this configuration is, was to see If you could get the helmet on over ail that, in case a suited re-entry became necessary at short notice, and it does go on. Randy Hester tried it and with just a little cocking of the head you can get the helmet on over. How s that sound to you? ^ Okay, Gordy. That sounds essentially what we were thinking about. We hadn't got to the extent of trying to hook them up yet, you know, put them together yet, but we're thinking along the same lines anyhow. And you brought up a couple of points that's good.
|CAPCOM|Okay, if you got any questions or anythin.*;, I've got a demo model sitting right in front of me here, so that we can just discuss it real time as you get it set up. I assume you're going to try to work that up tonight. Is that right? Is that right?
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 20:47 GET 287:54 1035/1
287:54:00|SC|Yes, we can I guess. Okay, and the rea son you'd rather have Jack do it than me is simply because of the redun — I can't say the word, redundancy.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative. It gives you and Gene the best equipment and we see no reason why this won't work, but like you said it's; only one mike in place of two on the other ones.
|SC|I'm surprised you didn't have us tape two headsets to the Snoopy helmet.
|CAPCOM|W7ell Jack, we'll just take that chance.
|SC|Well, it took 14 days but I finally know whe re I s t and .
|CAPCOM|I do have a question - well, first of all I give you a little weather for the south pacific tomorrow if your interested.
|SC|Stand by and let's get the commander on the headset here in a minute then you can pass it up..
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|CAPCOM|Not bad.
|SC|Well, I'll let her go this time.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we: got them.
|SC|Okay, we'll torque at 59:45.
|CAPCOM|Alrighty.
|CAPCOM|America we would like to stop the roll this time around as you come up on 146 roll.
|SC|Okay, we'll stop it on 146 roll.
|CAPCOM|America Houston. When you get her stopped there we'd like you to hold the attitude until we get the DSE dump before doing the verb 49.
|SC|Okay, Gcrdo we're there now.
|SC|Houston, America. We can take those words on the weather in the recovery area if you like.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it can be summed up by one word excellent. 2000 scattered and high scattered forecast I'm looking at a satellite picture high resolution satellite picture that shows you in the middle of a big high and see just very faint hint of clouds in the area. And, the trend of the weather movement is such that you're going into an even clearer area but tomorrow the wind will be 090 at 10, visibility 10, 2994 on the altimeter. It's of no consequence to the Navy guys but the land lubber will be glad to learn that there is 3 foot wave heights and temperature is 77 degrees. Over.
|SC|Sounds like a fighter pilot's day to come aboard. I think they will be able to take those seas.

288:50:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 289 hours 8 minutes. We'll be putting the crew to bed in about an hour, actually about 50 minutes from now. And they're eating dinner at this time. No major item scheduled on the Flight Plan between now and the time they begin their sleep period. During the night, the Flight Dynamics Officer and the Retro Return to Earth Officer will be compiling their last stretch of tracking data on the spacecraft and computing the final midcourse correction which would be performed at about 3 hours prior to entry. At the present time that midcourse correction would appear to be very small, around 2 feet per second. Apollo 17 at this time about 80 000 miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity going through 6000 feet per second and we'll see an ever more rapid buildup in that velocity as the spacecraft nears Earth.
|SC|Hello, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Gordo, we're just finishing chow and doing a little cleaning up and double checking the stowage and so forth. But we'do have a minute. Is there by any chance any late news, anything going on today that might be of interest?
|CAPCOM|Okay. I haven't heard of anything. You did get a news report this morning. Is that correct?
|SC|Yes. We sure did.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll see if there's any Delta's in that. It'll take me a couple of minutes.
|SC|Okay. How's the Houston weather today?
|CAPCOM|It was overcast, but warmer. Kind of standard Winter weather for around here. Not nearly so frigid as it has been the last couple days.
|SC|Oky doke.
|SC|Hello, Houston, America.
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, Gordo, the entry stowage will be as - as in the Flight Plan Supplement, with the exception that there is a, a small lab jettison bag, max weight of about 25 pounds, which will be, which is already, as a matter of fact, p acked in A-7.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we got that.
|SC|And the presently used jettison bag weight really isn't very much at all. That's just for housekeeping trash and so forth. We will tie between A-2 and A-3 and there's probably not, at the most, more than 5 pounds there.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|SC|And right now, we haven't seen any specific spot to tie down the LEVA's. If you've got a recommendation, we'll take it. If not, we'll just pick a spot down in the IB area to tie them down.

289:36:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston, I've got an update to the news.
|SC|Okay, Houston, America's listening.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's some more like human interest stuff rather than pure news. One thing in the liberty bowl football game Georgia Tech beat Iowa State - well I guess it's not quite over yet this is a fourth quarter Georgia Tech 31 Iowa State 24. And, there is a story about the Moon ship that's streaking smoothly homeward. There's nothing in it that you don't know about, though except maybe one little part of the article describing quote from William E. Fastie of John Hopkins University member of the orbital science team who said that a rather startling discovery is the Moon is simply not degasing. It has nothing left in terms of anything that can create an atmosphere. Much to his surprise even the amount of hydrogen an element that should have been the most abundant outgasing candidate turned out to be about one percent of it's predicted value. He speculated that the absence of a planetary magnetic field on the Moon works the purge surface of any atmospheric accumulation. The atoms of gasses that have vented to the surface he theorized pick up an electrical charge and are then swepted away by the solar wind which is a stream of electrified atoms pushing far out into the solar systems of the Sun. Former president Truman is stabilized is the word they are using now. His heart condition is unchanged. His kidneys are failing him and he's termed to be still in a very serious condition, but resting confortably. A declining birth rate and a desire for fewer children in the years ahead had caused the census bureau to reduce sharply it's estimates of future population growth in the United States. By the year 2000, for example, the estimate is now twenty million fewer people than had been forcast on the basis of previous statistics. Reduction could have major implications for American Society in many areas and it reflects changes in birth and child planning which now suggests that the U. S. may eventually reach zero population growth. The last one is pretty interesting, and more so if you can see the picture that goes with the story, about James L. G. Fitzpatrick who for 40 years has been interested in copying natural flight and he has now designed a batlike flying machine that may be ready for a test run next summer. Fitzpatrick said that the first, that first every small part of the ungainly structure must be tested carefully otherwise you end up either in a disaster or a grave and we try to avoid that sort of thing. After 3 decades of trying, Fitzpatrick who's 66, believes his latest
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 22"30 GET 289:36 MC-1038/2
289:36:00|CAPCOM|device comes closest to the real thing although it still needs a small motor to flap the wings. Asked whether his device, as yet unnamed, works on the flight principal of a bird, he said I don't know any one who knows what principal a bird works on, but I guess this is more like a bat or a pterodactyl. Fitzpatrick's winged copter or flapping wing airplane is equipped with cockpit controls that include a throttle, that regulates the one horsepower engine and up and down flight. Other equipment include rudder pedals to regulate a power steering system, a parking brake, a pseudopaddagieum, I don't know what that word is, it's a new one on me, to transfer power from the engine to the wings, and a 2-way radio. It has a maximum 40 foot wing-span and weighs 320 pounds. It is 6 feet long and it looks like a cage of scaffolding covered in parts by canvas. He said he's far enough along on building his device that he will be able to test the way the wings move in the Staten Island Community College Gym by the first of the year. However, there will be no free flying. The gymnasium test will involve tying weights to the wing tips and flapping the wings. He said that his bird is rather slow in maturing and it's been a long gestation period which involved 9000 hours of experimentation, 40 000 dollars in his money and the disection of 300 birds of various species. I've been interested in flight since 1930 he said. Basically I was curious as to why various things flew and I've been painfully finding out ever since. And he winds up with a real quote here. He said never has so much been done with so little success. That's the news. No, wait a minute, one final closing story. In Atlanta, Georgia a 5 year old boy crawled up on Santa's lap in a department store and asked him what Santa would need if he had 2 boots and 1 sock. Dick Wright, a Georgia State University graduate student in the off season, said he thought quickly and replied another sock and the child punched him in the stomach.
|SC|Huh, Merry Christmas. Thank you for the news, Gordo.
|SC|That's a very enjoyable evening to go to bed with on our final night of the flight.
|CAPCOM|Before you turn in we got a little shopping list to run down with you if you, nothing to right down, but, if you're ready to listen.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, the surgeons, are first of all, request that Ron press on his sensors, they're looking like they're getting loose according to the data here. They also recommend for Ron that if he's still using the nose drops, I guess he has been, they recommend that he
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 CST 22:30 GET 289:36 MC-1038/3
289:36:00|CAPCOM|take one decongestant pill before going to sleep and one after breakfast in the morning. It's a suggestion, it's bis option, the thought being it might help in clearing your ears during that final descent. You may leave the optics power on for more heat in the cabin if you wish. We'd like you to stop charge on battery B. Over.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 00:57 CST 290:04 GET 1039/1
290:04:00|SC|Okay, take that off the line now. Off the charger.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and we'd like the IR OFF.
|SC|Okay, it's OFF Gordy.
|CAPCOM|Okay and we owe you an answer on what to do with the LEVA's. I guess they were suppose to be on the helmets in the PGA bag. Is that going to be a real pain to get at and put them there?
|SC|No, it's not going to be a pain at all, Gordo, it's just impossible.
|CAPCOM|Okay, well -
|SC|There's just no room in there at all - not - none at all.
|CAPCOM|Okay, I'll probably not have an answer for you tonight but first thing in the morning - someplace to put them.
|SC|Okay, it won't be any problem to stash them somewhere but we though maybe you had a better idea than we'did, if not when get our rock bags tied down and all in place we'll take a look at a good spot for the LEVA's and let you know.
|CAPCOM|Okay, GNC - I don't know where you are on the check list - let's see - just a reminder to zero the optics before you turn in. And I'd like to say for the whole white team who are just - here in another hour will finish up their - their work with the Apollo program, and myself included, that this sure has been a pleasure working with not only the two best spacecraft the program has seen but we think the best and most cooperative and a - crew also and it's been a privelege in my estimation and a real pleasure too, and looking forward to seeing you on Thursday.
|SC|Well, Gordo, those are awful kind words, and we too appreaciate it very much but I think you know how we feel about the help you guys give us down there is what really makes our job easy up here. From the Cape back to the Pacific it's the guys from the trench all the way up to the top back there and that's what it's really all about. We thank you, those are good words, but just consider them reciprocal also.
|CAPCOM|Thank you.
|SC|And we appreciate it there white team.
|CAPCOM|Thank you, Ron.
|SC|Gordo, we'll hang on the air here and we're going to finish up our pre-sleep check list and we'll just give you one final buzz before we go off on the voice swi t ch.
|CAPCOM|Okay, very good.
|SC|By the way, the Earth is sure starting to get big.
|CAPCOM|Okay, you're about 80 000 miles out.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/18/72 22:57CST 290:04GET MC1039/2
290:04:00|SC|Okay, outstanding. I guess, based upon your mid-course 7 that that's a good sign, Isn't it? - That It's getting big?
|CAPCOM|That's what It's suppose to do.
|SC|It's a - although there's not much of it to see, it's really sort of spectacular because the crescent is getting smaller and smaller although the Moon is getting - is getting larger and of course the crescent we're looking at now is the Pacific but even if there were land masses in there I don't think we could see it much besides the reflection off the clouds - and a - well, in this case, the ocean — but - It's really a pretty spectacular sight because out the other window, now that we're on a intervertical PTC we've got a full Moon looking back at us and it's sort of a poetic place to be the night before entry.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, I'll bet it is.
|SC|Hang in there, babe, and we'll see you for sure Thursday.
|CAPCOM|Okay, it's a deal.

|CAPCOM|That's fine with ECOMM. Your choice.
|AMERICA|Okay, we're just going to back to auto on the switches.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|And we also would like to take that inverter off. It's getting a little warm in here now and this PTC ought to be pretty comfortable tonight.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|AMERICA|Okay, we'll take inverter number 3 off. And I think the power's off also.
|CAPCOM|Okay.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 290 hours 34 minutes. We expect to be putting the crew to bed shortly as soon as they finish up some last minute items. Their sleep period was scheduled to begin about 30 minutes ago. And, at the present time, Apollo 17 is 75 300 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 6364 feet per second. During the sleep period, the flight dynamics officer and return to Earth officer, or RETRO, will be compiling additional tracking data on the spacecraft and making final computations for a midcourse correction. The last opportunity for midcourse correction comes about 3 hours prior to entry interface, designated midcourse correction 7. Right now, it looks like that maneuver would require no more than about 2 feet per second velocity change. This is for Corridor Control to get the flight path angle of the entry very close to the desired 6 and a half degrees below the horizontal. That flight path angle at the present time is quite close to the desired angle. We're in the process of a shift handover at this time in Mission Control. Flight director Pete Frank will be the oncoming flight director and the spacecraft communicator, CAPCOM, will be astronaut Bob Parker. There will be no change of shift press briefing. This is Apollo Control at 290 hours 36 minutes.

|CAPCOM|Okay, I might read you a page -
|SC|(Garble)
|CAPCOM|Go ahead.
|SC|Okay, we've been waiting a long time for Anchor's Aweigh. And we've missed it. (laughter) -
|CAPCOM|I imagine -
|SC|You want to play it again.
|CAPCOM|I imagine you'll hear it a couple of more times today too.
|SC|Oh, okay, but if we could hear it again that ' d be great.
|CAPCOM|It'll take them a while to cue it up and maybe we'll work on that. Let me give you guys a few items here while you're thinking. Number one, the old weather report. 2000 scattered, high scattered, 10 miles visibility, 3 foot seas, and the winds are out of the east at 10 knots. Just about exactly what you had yesterday and probably what we've been telling you for 2 or 3 days. Looks like we're going to have a midcourse 7 this morning about 2 feet per second. Pretty much just to really center us in the corridor. We're already within the corridor now with no problems. We're going to exit PTC at the different roll angle. We'll read that up to you later when you get the flight plan out, but just so you don't go ahead and exit early we will be sending you something up on that exit PTC to new roll angle and as far as the levers are concerned you guys have been looking for a place to stow those last night and what we're suggesting is putting them in the sleeper strain on top of A8 where you got one suit stowed apparently. And we're suggesting you put one of those on the helmet on that PGA, And the other one if were loose is in the bag. Ove r,
|SC|Houston, America. We've got the PGA's in the bag. (Laughter) Hope that's right.
|CAPCOM|You got all three of them in the L—shaped bags or have you got - the understanding down here apparently in talking last night was that one was in the sleeper strain on top of A8, in a sleeper strain bag.
|SC|Well, we've got CMP and LMP suits at the bottom. I'll leave the commander and LMP suits at the bottom part of it. CMP suit's in the top of it - in the top of the L-shaped bag.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we'll work on that and we've got something else for you here in just a minute. Music from "Anchors Aweigh"
|SC|Thank you, Robert. Most appreciative.
|CAPCOM|Okay, we aim to please. That's also, I might tell you guys, the third time we've played that this morning, although you only heard it twice. We played it once
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/19/72 GET 298:11 CST 0705 MC-1050/2
298:11:00|CAPCOM|before we sent the crew alert.
|SC|CMP has no comment.
|CAPCOM|Okay, America, we'd like to request the medium on high gain antenna, please.
|SC|Okay, you have REACQ at Medium.
|CAPCOM|Okay, and I guess now on the levers what we're suggesting is you put down - put the two of them in by themselves in a sleep restraint and tie it down on top of A8. And I've got a lot of fancy words on how to tie it down on top of A8 if you guys can't figure out how to do it. I can read it off to you or we can leave it to your intuitive good sense.
|SC|Well so far we've been pretty much with most of your recomendations around here, I think we could probably hack that one too.

|SC|Okay, ask for a dump now.
|SC|(Laughter). Testing - accelerating my EMS p ump .
|SC|Well, I'll be darned. And Houston, you've got an entry at Bobo on the null Bias check. EMS is counting like a sun of a gun. (Laughter.) Almost as fast as the Delta V test, but not quite.
|CAPCOM|Roger. And you're really smoking along aren't you.
|SC|(Laughter) Yeah. No, I wouldn't think that it would accept that, but -
|CAPCOM|Right.
|SC|Anyhow we'll use burn time and - 985 for the - to burn.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|CAPCOM|Ron, you're happy with your EMS Null Bias check, aren't you?
|SC|Negative, none, there's no Bias check, no. I'll give you count in a minute. We'll review the EMS Delta V test and then go back and try another Null Bias check. But, it looks like we're count from about 100 to 75 in 30 seconds. Let me check that out.
|SC|It's okay, at that Delta V test, and that time we got a bias 20.3.
|SC|Okay, Houston. They started at minus 100 on the Null Bias check. 30 seconds at 118.8. 1-minute 137.8.
|CAPCOM|Ron, would you verify those are negative n umbers ?
|SC|That's affirmative they're negative. Okay, a minute and 40 seconds minus 163.7 or so. Okay, Houston, we've got a little bit of time here and looks like we've still got 3 EMS tests left, I'd like to go ahead and do another EMS Test on that and we'll see if that integrator is all fouled up completely. I'll be with you in a minute.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron. We agree.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, test 1 looks all right. And test 2 is okay, (garble). Okay, going to test 3. 10 seconds MARK it upper light came on. Okay, a 58.0 in the range counter. MARK it.

|SC|Think you can get those things done by that time?
|SC|Okay, just (garble). Gosh, let's go ahead and trim it. Okay, we are trimmed. That don't hurt. NOUN 20 - 24 minutes to burn.
|SC|Houston, America. Does it look like we're going to hack it on the waste water tank there? Tank 2.
|CAPCOM|Ron, yes we're not going to dump the waste water tank at this time and we won't dump it after midcourse 7, of course.
|SC|Okay. Just what I like to hear.
|SC|Bat C up around 36.5. Pyros - 36.9 - 36.9. Okay. Fuel cells are looking good too. AC is looking good. It's 18 minutes yet.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston.
|SC|America, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Oh Ron, we've been checking around the CMS tests and the null Bias tests and we concur on this burn using NOUN 85's in your burn time as your ques and not using the EMS. We would like, however, for you to bias the EMS. Set in a plus 118.8 at - and it will go to normal at tig minus 30 seconds and we'd just be interested in what the EMS does under a very small G field like this.
|SC|Okay. We'll set in at plus 118.8 and turn it to normal at Tig minus 30 seconds and I'll try to look at it at the end of burn time. Or go to stand by at that point in time so we can make it a good hack on it.
|CAPCOM|Rog. Tbat'd great, Ron, and we see no problem for entry with the EMS.
|SC|Rog. Mighty fine.

(Garble) on but at this point in time it won't make any difference, I guess. CMC is on, ISS is onSCS is operating, we tested the caution and warning, the Delta V test works, both bias pumps and Delta VC, we'll set that up. Okay we got one more 11.8 and Delta V in standby. B mags are caged and Rate 2. Okay Auto RCS selects, we'll put those on for trim. Position of trim - X axis only. Okay, I'll leave BD off. I got the DAP VERB 4 NOUN 46, enter , CSM don't use AC use BD for plus X. Narrow deadband half a degree per second. Use BD for roll, okay. Okay, mode controller, HC's are off. Directs are on. 13 minutes. Okay, I got the DET set. I'm checking degrees. And we're in CMC and AUTO. We're in the burn attitude then boresight sextant star check for P41 and maneuvered to right attitude. And we're still in Rate 2. Okay, Auto, okay, I think I'm going to realign them on the old GDC. Okay, the old GDC is aligned - let's see, (garble) answer in rate command. The min deadband rate to low. Limit cycle is off. Att one. Rate 2. Okay, standby for 5 minutes and we're 10 minutes from burn, Gene. And Jack, burn time is 9 seconds. Nine seconds. And we'll trim X only to 2/10's of a foot per second. Houston, America, does this kind of change our entry angle about 2/10's? 2/10's of a degree?
|CAPCOM|2/10's of a degree, Ron.
|SC|Oh, okay. Which way is it best, keep it under or shallow it up?
|CAPCOM|It'll make you a little more shallow. Very little shallow -
|SC|Oh, okay. Okay.
|CAPCOM|Ron, it's going to run you from 6.7 entry angle to a 6.49.
|SC|Oh, okay. Yeah, that's what I thought, okay.
|SC|Eight minutes to go.
|SC|Okay.
|SC|Next time we'do this we'll have to allow a little more time for the dumping prior to the burns.

|SC|Okay, EMS is 100.1. Okay, test control power is off. Direct's are OFF, flight controllers are safed.
|SC|Houston, it looks like the burn was right on the money. You saw the residuals and burn - was a 9 second burn on time.
|CAPCOM|Roger, America, it looked good.
|SC|And the REV 66 is it.
|CAPCOM|Roger.
|SC|Ah-ha, I get to get out of my g-suit. Oh, while I think about it Houston, I've noticed it throughout the flight here, in the simulator CMC control will allow your rates - you know to bounce back and forth - maybe up to - oh, sometimes a tenth burn likely at .05 degrees per second, as it trims to within the dead band. In 4 jet translations- as well as in 2 jett translations your rates get up to about almost 4/10 of a degree per second as in damping within it's own dead band there.

|SC|Yeah, Bob, this is Jack, did you have any prob lem reading me with this count configuration I got on now,
|CAPCOM|No, we're reading you loud and clear. If I was a little late on that it was because I've got some problems down here on my console that's all. The whole room yelled at me that you'd called.
|SC|No, no that's no problem. I just hadn't made a check with you and I just wanted to make sure I was readable.

|CAPCOM|Read you loud and clear, Ron.
|SC|Okay, good. I understand you want a Null Bias Check again.
|CAPCOM|Yeah, we're just wondering if maybe the - if maybe it was an air bubble or something in there - in the small g field of that midcourse 7 burn might have changed something just like to take a look at it .
|SC|Okay, we'll take a look at it. Okay, 30 seconds 94.0, starting at plus 100 that time for some reason. One minute, 87.8. Okay, it was 79.0 at a minute and 40 seconds.
|CAPCOM|Okay, Ron, we got that.
|SC|Do you want to try the minus 100 part of it, or do you think it's worth it.
|CAPCOM|Well, Ron we'd like it - it's just that data gathering point that's all — you know that's G&N entry.
|SC|Okay, we'll start. The other guys are crawling around down under the couches — they're trying to get the stuff locked in there, anyhow. I think I must have shrank, my shoes went on easier now than they did on the fitting, I must have shrunk, I guess is the correct terminology. Shrunk, shrank?

You know, I never noticed it before, but looking next to the earth, right now, and of course, that makes it a kind of bluish reflection inside the ah - the sextant, and you can't see the reticle brightness at all. It just, you know, it just comes through the black - black line in there. And there are two lines you know, I've got 2 - one of them must be, - there are 2 reticles, no, there are 2 reticles, one's in focus but the other one isn't.

The crew is at this time going through all of the checklist shown in the flight plan for getting the spacecraft ready for entry. Continue to stay up live all the way through first blackout if possible, which will be through the Hawaii tracking station.

303:07:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We looked through the Cal Curve1and we recommend no preheat on the RCS.
|SC|Roger, Houston. I understand. No RCS preheat -commence with RCS preheat.
|CAPCOM|That's affirmative.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. Somebody is standing by on the VHF. We'd like to get the VHF voice check out of the way if1it's possible.
|SC|Okay, go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Stand by. We'll reconfigure here.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/19/72 CST 12:08 GET 303:15 MC-1071/1
303:15:00|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We'd like to verify that the left antenna is selected and that we are in VHF simplex ALFA.
|CAPCOM|America Houston. America, Houston.
|SC|Houston, this is America, go ahead on that b et.
|CAPCOM|Roger. Did you get my last call, that we'd like to verify in left antenna and in simplex ALFA, and we'll give you VHF check here shortly.
|SC|Affirmative. Maybe that was feed-through we were on, Jack was on VHF, called you back on VHF, must have been S-band feed through, though. But verified we're on antenna left and VHF simplex ALFA.
|CAPCOM|Roger, Ron. And ah we are going up (garble) I understand Jack is reading us on the VHF.
|SC|Yeah, that's affirm. He was retransmitting on VHF, evidently you were reading our VHF.
|CAPCOM|Roger. It's normal to have VHF uplink prior to receiving VHF downlink. We're satisfied here.
|SC|Okay. Mighty fine.
|CAPCOM|And Ron, just for a verification, we will make another VHF check when you get a little closer, so we can get a downlink signal on you.
|SC|Oh, okay real well.
|SC|Hello, Houston. We have a GO on the PYRO Bats, they're both 37, we're picking the checklist up on the top of 1-6.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We understand.
|SC|Okay, I'm panel 8. Okay, direct auto open command module heaters are open, okay, docking probe are open, Whoops, stand by, stand by, let's close the RCS logic buss. RCS logic Main A, main B going closed. Okay, docking probes are open, SPS pitch and yaw are open 2 more, at least 4 of them open, 3-flip lights are open, and SECS ARM are open, EDS batts are open, ELS/CSM SEPs are open, post landing vent is open. Okay, all the others are closed.
|SC|Rog, seems pretty good, let's recheck it here. Okay, GDC is realigned?
|SC|Okay, Houston, if you're ready we're gonna pick up the Command Module RCS activiation.
|CAPCOM|Roger, we're standing by.
|SC|Okay, six arm circuit breakers, 2 of them are going closed, okay, Houston, ready for the logic arm.
|CAPCOM|You're GO for logic.
|SC|Okay, logic 1, and logic 2.
|CAPCOM|America, you're GO for PYRO Arm.
|SC|Okay, GO for PYRO arm. PYRO arm A PYRO arm B.
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/19/72 CST 12:08 GET 303:15 MC-1071/2
303:15:00|SC|Okay.
|SC|Okay, Houston, coming up on the command module RCS Pressure. 3, 2, 1, MARK It. And we got it.
|SC|Boy, you sure can hear it flow in somewhere.
|CAPCOM|America, Houston. We've got 2 good readings
|SC|Very good Houston, they're looking good on b o ard.
|SC|Okay, safe some PYROS.
|CAPCOM|Okay, America, Houston. I've got a short update on your entry checklist.
|SC|Go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Over on page 2-4 of the entry checklist, middle of the page, we would like to delete, EMS mode to normal at that point. EMS mode to normal, delete. We'd like to move it over on the 2-5 at 05-G-time. Put EMS mode normal.
|SC|Okay, we'll get the EMS normal at 05-G.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We have no update on the entry pad you are nominal at this time. I do have your weather information and your ship recovery call signs. Over.
|SC|Okay, Bob. Why don't you go ahead.
|CAPCOM|Okay, generally the weather is good, it's 3000 foot scattered, 10-miles visibility. Wind is 130 at 10, wave heights 2 to 3 feet. Altimeter, 29.94. The altimeter 29.94 will give you a minus 17—foot Delta H which means, Gene, that when the altimeter says 0 you'll still be 17 feet in the air. Closest recovery forces, the prime recovery shift is Tyco, call sign Tyco. Closest recovery will be - aircraft will be a helicopter call sign RECOVERY and a back up will be call sign SWIM and they'll be on scene on splash. In case of the constant G entry for any reason, the aircraft call sign is SYM0A, rescue 1 will be down range and in the vicinity of the constant g-point. Over.
|SC|Okay, we got TYCO, and the prime recovery ship, prime chopped is RECOVERY, the backup is SWIM and we've got rescue 1 SYMOA, down range.
|CAPCOM|I guess that's up range, depending on how you look at it, Gene.
|SC|(Laughter) Okay.

|SC|(Laughter)
|SC|Houston, be advised that hydrogen tanks 1 and 2 still seem to be with us. At least I got gage readings about 200 PSI.
|CAPCOM|Roger. We'll run that one through E-COMM
|SC|(Laughter).
|SC|All right, save the 55 for a minute - pressure Main A and Main B, both controllers are ON. That means they got AC-1. Should be 153, I think it is. Here it is right here. Yep, no more eating upside down. I was just getting use to that, a lot of fun.
|SC|Getting use to it. I was use to it after the 1st - 2nd day. You know the - it wants to trim itself, pitch up too. I gotta keep whappin' the right yaw, and I gotta keep - pitch it down, to make it go down. See the rate just decreases.
|SC|10 minutes to Moon, I'd like to see a moon. There it is up there. Can you see it Jack, it's out of window 3.
|SC|It should be out to your right. You might be able to see it.

|SC|RRT.
|SC|Okay, you want to go to Rate Command?
|SC|Okay, both RG1s is 29.
|SC|We have a drogue,
|PAO|And the beginning of blackout was at the predicted time of approximately 17 seconds after entry interface into the atmosphere - 400 000 feet or approximately 85 miles above the Earth. Come out of black out in a total time of about 3 minutes 27 seconds. Following reappearance, at least from a communications stand point, of the space craft. The drogue parachutes, which are 16 1/2 foot daimeter, two of them, will be deployed by a mortar - pyrotechnic device at 23 000 feet above the surface. The main parachutes, which consist of three 83 1/2 foot diameter ring sail parachutes, will be pulled out by pilot parachutes -small pilot parachutes at an altitude of 10 1/2 thousand feet. The spacecraft will splash down at approximately 22 miles per hour with 3 fully inflated parachutes. Meanwhile, the crew is using the entry monitor system to steer for the desired aiming point which is some 1044 miles down range from the actual entry point into the atmosphere. The Entry Monitor System - or EMS as it's referred to, gives a display to the crew which gives them the roll angle to steer to the desired track down range -to hit the aiming point. Now the position of the recovery ship, Tyconderoga, may or may not be near the aiming point. The accuracy of the landing is dependent on the distance from the aiming point, not from where the ship is at the time. Should be coming out of black out, as mentioned earlier, at 3 minutes 37 seconds into entry. Less than a minute away and hopefully we will have confirmation from the crew on drogue deployment, and main parachute deployment, assuming that communications through the Apollo range instrumented aircraft called ARIA is good. The Tico - the Ticonderoga, prime recovery ship has reported that they have radar contact with the spacecraft. Probably a skin track of the spacecraft with the ship's radar. We've re-entered black out - reappeared from blackout, I should say. We're waiting for a call from the space - from the CAPCOM.

305:08:00|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The control room here is quite full of people. Off shift flight controllers, management people watching the recovery operations in progress on the large television projector at the front of the control room. Waiting for that moment when the crew is safely on the deck of the ship to fire up their traditional splashdown cigars.
|SPEAKER|Land only long enough to drop off several of the photographers, the still photographers and the motion picture photographers from NASA who have been on board. They will get themselves into position to photograph the ceremony and then the chopper will go back upstairs. Because Sam Drumy - our cameraman - the man who is giving us all thos wonderful shots - the closeup shots of the command module on the water - we want to get back up topside so we can get more pictures of the Ticonderoga during the ceremony. The ceremony, itself, is outlined rather extensively in the instructional sheet and the Astronauts are reading perhaps right now.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control here in the control center. The Network controller has climbed a tall ladder to hang the final in the Apollo plaques along the upper wall of the control center. All the cigars are still unlit, waiting in the mouths of the flight control team, for the actual time the crew is safely on deck of the Ticonderoga. Waiting as the helicopters approach the ship, great deal of joviality under way here in the control center. Hand shaking, best wishes, from management, flight controllers, other people who have been associated with the Apollo Program for the past ten years. Network controller still at the top of his ladder spring loaded to hang the plaque on the wall -

305:18:00|SPEAKER|Since they are to go below deck and undergo a rather extensive medical - examinations maybe they'd just like to delay that just a little bit.
|SPEAKER|GARBLE.
|SPEAKER|That was Samoa rescue 1. The airplane that has been up over head and that was available if any other kind of rescue operation had been indicated, it wasn't. Everybody will start circling back toward this ship, including the radar planes that had been out to assist.
|SPEAKER|And locate on the spacecraft as it came down toward the Pacific. And there will be some celebration on this ship. This evening a party with the astronauts and special guests -but most of the time after they get on the ship they will be spending time in the scientific laboratories aboard. The ones that are prepared for the Skylab program that are being used here on the Apollo 17 mission. They won't even get a chance to take a shower for more than an hour. The other thing that they'd probably like to be doing is calling their families at home but there's no time located in the schedule for that. No time allocated for that until 5 o'clock this afternoon. Quick calculation tells us that that will be about 9 o'clock eastern time ladies so they will be calling you at that time. Now 001 and 002 moving in toward the deck of the Ticonderoga. All ready the men are prepared to roll out that red carpet. And there's a shot from our photo helicopter. You can see it landing on the fantail, 001 helicopter, you can also see 002 as it flies away. It will not be landing now because the recorders turned on and the ceremony will be ready to begin.
|PAO|This is Apollo Control with the helicopter safely on the deck. The network controller, Dave Young, will hang the final placque in the Apollo series on the upper wall of the control room here. And this circuit, known up until now as Gemini Control and Apollo Control will reappear as Skylab Control in the spring. This is Apollo Control out at 305:25 ground elapsed time.
|SPEAKER|Also in the foreground the bald headed man in the middle of the picture, Dr. Don Stalkin who is the NASA team leader. He will be the first man on the deck to be seen by the astronauts. He will be the man who will step up to greet them, and to remind them again of what they have already been told on the instructional sheet. Watch out for your heads — for Schmitt and Evans. Step down three steps. Wave and smile. And the instruction sheet says follow me. GARBLE.
|SPEAKER|GARBLE arriving.
|SPEAKER|The carpet is down. (Music) All three men, one at a time. And now they are out on the deck. The middle man is Evans all right. (Cheer) And they are in proper array as the band strikes up Anchors Aweigh as could be predicted. Cernan in front, Schmitt in the middle. Being greeted by Admiral Butts, by Captain Norman Green and by Air Force General David Jones. Some pretty happy looking astronauts. On the stage that is prepared for them - Captain Green.

305:18:00|GREEN|It gives me great pleasure this morning, to welcome the crew of Apollo 17 back from the Moon to the deck of Ticonderoga. We on Ticonderoga are very proud to be a part of this historic mission. Chaplain John Ecker will offer our prayer to almighty God for the safe return of these three astronauts.
|ECKER|The heavens declare your glory oh Lord. The planets, the sun, the moon, and the stars which you set in place, in humble gratitude we thank you for the safe return from your heaven of these pioneers in space. May their achievements contribute to the unity of mankind and peace for all your people in this holy season. Amen.

305:28:00|SPEAKER|Commander of Manned Space Flight Recovery Forces Pacific. Rear Admiral John L. Butts.
|BUTTS|(Applause) Captain Cernan, you and your crew of Apollo 17, all the men of the Recovery Force, all the ships, units and aircrafts, join me in expressing our great pride in your accomplishments today. And as you noticed Captain Cernan, on your left we have distinguished members of the Congress of the United States here to welcome you back aboard, as well as the Govenor of American Samoa. And all of these gentlemen join me in telling you how happy we are to have you home. I'd like to introduce Major General David M. Jones, The Department of Defense Manager for Manned Space Flight Support Operations. General Jones.
|JONES|(Applause) On behalf of the entire Depart ment of Defense Apollo Support Team, we're honored to welcome the crew of Apollo 17. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Teams that have supported the Apollo - entire Apollo Program are particularly pleased to offer our congratulations on your flawless performance. I am proud to present the crew of Apollo 17, Captain Gene Cernan, Dr. Jack Schmitt, and Commander Ron Cernan. And I believe it's all yours.
|CERNAN|(Applause) Let me say that first of all, how good it is to be home. You know, no matter where you go or where the trip takes you, it's always good to get home. Admiral Butts, I'd like to congratulate you and really thank you for for allowing the three of us to be part of your recovery team, because, today was just absolutely fantastic. And a day I know we'll never forget as long as we live. And in all due respect to General Jones, we got our start on the Atlantic Missile Range so to speak. But, I think we just proved over these last 13 days, that when you want to end something right, whether it be a recovery or whether it be an Apollo Program, by golly, you've got to call on the Navy. (Cheers) And I'm going to see if I can talk Captain Green into splitting miss distance with me today. And I don't think we have too much to quarrel about. I do want to say, this has been an extremely rewarding 13 days for us. Thirteen days that I hope, people throughout the world can share with us, when it was happening, and certianly, I hope, in the future after we sort of gather it all together and find out how much we really learned. We think we flew a good mission, we think we accomplished something, and by golly, we're proud of it. You know, a few years back, I was on a deck of a carrier like this after Apollo 10, when I came back from the Moon and I was extremely excited and enthused, certainly no more than I am now. But, I said at that time, when I came back and I just have reproved it to myself that, that nothing is impossible in this world, when dedicated people are involved. And it's a fundamental law of nature, that either you must grow, or you must die. Whether that be an idea, whether that be a man, whether that be a flower or a country, I thank God that our country is chosen to grow. I'm really proud to be here, I'm proud to be part of Apollo 17
||APOLLO 17 MISSION COMMENTARY 12/19/72 CST 14:21 GET 305:28 MC-1084/2
305:28:00|CERNAN|I'm proud to be a part of NASA, I'm very proud to be a Captain in the Navy, and most of all, I'm proud to be an American. And I'd like to present another guy who's pretty proud to be an American, and in turn I'll let him present the 3rd member of our crew. But, first Commander Ron Evans. (Applause)
|EVANS|Thank you, Gene, General Green, - Captain Green, (Laughter) Admiral. You know, about 6—1/2 years ago, I was fortunate enough to be on the Ticonderoga, where I was notified, of my selection to the Astronaut Corps. I think it's quite fitting that I should happen to have the opportunity to be picked up by the Tico after our journey to the Moon. To me that's really something. The fact that, it was the Ticonderoga, is part of the United States Navy, the fact that I'm a Commander in the United States Navy, and I flew the United States Spacecraft America, to the Moon and back, I'm really honored and I'm proud. That's about the best way I can express it. And I think right now I'd like to present not our 3rd crew member, but the 3rd member of the Apollo 17 crew. Jack Schmitt. (Applaus e)
|SCHMITT|thank you. I'm happy to be here and I guess I never will be Navy. (Laughter) I'm sorry. But, if there was ever a team I'd like to be part of it's this one. Thank you very much. (Applause)
|PAO|And so the Astronauts are done with their ceremony and are doing what the sheet told them to not to do, they're shaking hands over there. The sheet said just step off the platform turn left and wave their salute, but they either forgot or decided to go ahead and do their thing —
