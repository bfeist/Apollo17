CC Challenger, Houston. I'm going to hand you over to the good Dr. Parker here. Have a good trip outside there.

[04:16:39:02] CDR-LM Gordy, thank you. You do outstanding work and we sure do appreciate it, babe. 
[04:16:39:18] CC My pleasure. 
[04:16:37:12] CDR-LM Bob, we'll give you a call in a minute. We Just made a couple of suit adjustments.
[04:16:37:18] CC Okay. Copy that. 
[04:16:40:38] CC Apollo 17, Houston. 
[04:16:40:43] CDR-LM Go ahead, Bob. 
[04:16:40:46] CC Okay, Challenger; we've Just lost about 16 dB on your high gain signal strength there. We're wondering if you happened to hit the switch there, has it moved, or could you give us a check on it? 
[04:16:41:02] CDR-LM We're nowhere near it. Standby 1. 
							CC Okay. And, Challenger, that should be a PITCH of 21 and a YAW of minus 45.
							CDR-LM Plus 21 and minus 45; Roger. Bob, about 2 minutes here. 
[04:16:46:30] LMP-LM Bob, this is Jack. On that high gain, I'm up close to 39 now, which is better than when we landed. Do you want me to do anything to it? 
							CC Standby on that. 
							CC Leave it alone. It seems to have gone away, Jack. It may have been a ground problem. 
							CC Did you guys adjust it, Jack? 
							LMP-LM Yes, Bob. We had to fix the drink bags and a couple other things.

Okay. Go down to 119:24 and add the following. 
Let me just read it to you in -quickly here, so 
you can put in the words you want to. The words 


are "Point at target marked by LMP. Use same 
technique as for Copernicus central peak." 


Okay. We'll point at the target by the LMP. Use 
the same technique, which is starting out at 
i second-


Roger. Let me read it to you. 


--was it 30 seconds? 


Roger. 1 second, two frames; 1/2 second, two 


frames; 1/4 second, two frames; 1/8 second, two 
frames; 1/16 second, two frames. On Copernicus, 
we're using a 30-second interval. It's not important, 
-the interval. It's mainly Just the 


stop settings on that. You're going to use a 


total of l0 frames. 


Okay. 


Okay, then add the following after that: After 


completion of above, switch to window CB3. For 


8 frame of end of target, Papa 17 Delta. At 


30-second intervals. Record frame number.

Ron, just general notes -may come up in the crew 
film area. Mag Papa Papa for crew option. Just 
use mag Papa Papa for crew option. Do not use 
Kilo Kilo for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo 
for crew option. The last one is save all the

Quebec. And what was the other one, Jack?

Okay. 


You know you look at -next to Macrobius A, there 
is a lind of a dark halo-type crater there. Very 
small one. And it doesn't have the appearance of 
a h_,mmocky crater rim to it, at all. It looks 
like the material Just kind of spreads out all 
over the area, but it doesn't have a h_mmocky 
appearance to it. I'm going to take a look at 
that again when I come back -on back around on 
the other side. There's a small mound down in 
the bottom of the crater, also. It's a domical


shaped structure in the bottom of that small crater. 
It's right next to J3. North of J3. 


Roger, Ron. 


Coming in, I can see the landing site, now quite 
well. The appearance of the slide area 
definitely shows up. The South Massif seems to 


have the Sun shining right on the walls. I'm 
looking for any type of layering, or anything 
like that. And can't see anything that -that 
would show that up. The big difference between 
the massif structures and the Sculptured Hills is 
that the massifs look like they are a steeper 


slope. And they -they don't seem to have that 
type of covering over them, like the Sculptured 


Hills do. 


I'm right over now. The scarp definitely cuts up 
through the North Massif. I can't see continuation 
on into the South Massif at all. But, you can 
definitely see a vertical exaggeration as it cuts 
on around up over the North Massif. And it's 


A]most -I'd have to take another look at it for 


sure, but it almost looks like a flow coming from 
Family or in the vicinity -in the direction of 
Family Mountain -but from the direction of Family 
Mountain -lapping up on the side of the North 
Massif. That's the way it looks as you go on by 
it. I couldn't see anything that would lead you 
to believe that the slide area, so to speak, would 
come on across anything that would be the source

of that slide area. Istill think I can see the 


one spot that has alighter albedo than the sur


rounding area there in the Pentagon complex. And 


it's pretty close to the -Let me get my chart out 
here and take a look at it again. 


No, it still looks like that area that's blown 


away there is Dog November -between Dog November 


and Dog Papa. And about 83.4 or something like 


that. 


Copy. 


Yes, just like the map shows, and all the pictures, 
you've got a definite demarcation in the annulus 
around Serenitatis here, as you look by Sulpicius 
Gallus area. As you look at it -I'm going to 
have to take another check on it -but the dark 
annulus looks to me like it's raised above the 
mare, proper, itself. I'll check that a little 


more as we come on across. 


You know all those rilles to the north of -I 


mean to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. There is a 


bunch of crisscrossing. One is right on the edge 


of the Serenitatis basin -and I don't remember 


the name of that crater, I'll have to look it up 
later -but they've got slightly raised rims around 
the rilles. You can see some layering down inside 
the rille itself, in the east-west and the one 


that runs in the east-west direction. 


Roger. You're talking about near Menelaus? 


Yes, I'll have to look on the map and see for 


sure what the crater is, but there's an impact 


crater right on the edge of Serenitatis basin 


right on the terminator. Right now. 


Roger. 


And then those rilles are just to the north of 


that crater. 


Roger. That's probably Menelaus -M-e-n-e-l-a-u-s -
Menelaus.

Might made notes, so I wouldn't forget about 
it. It was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes 
a heek of a long time to vent that tunnel. In the 
simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and 
it flips right down and vents. And I was beginning 
to wonder if it -if it was leaking or something. 
CC Roger. 
CMP As it turned out, as it turns out, it worked out 
all right. But I bet it took a good l0 minutes, -
to get up to 3.5. Before I could turn the jets 
back on, you know. 
CC Roger. 
CMP Go, that's ready to go. 
CC Ron, Just one reminder as we go around the horn 
here. The waste water -the way -the position 
it is in will probably take between l0 and 12 minutes 
to dump it completely. Or dump it to your 
l0 percent number. 
CMP Okay, that 's good. Oh, glad I don 't have anybody 
watching for me this time. Do I? 
CC Yes, that's right. We won't be able to call you 
on that. When it's down to 8 percent.

CDR-EVA Hey, let me ask you. When I was behind the LM, I 
could look right into an area and see the bell of 
the ascent stage. I never realized that before, 
but I guess that's normal, huh? 
LMP-EVA Yes. We saw it on the pad. Remember. 
CDR-EVA Barely. 
LMP-EVA Remember when we went out there? 
CDR-EVA The only reason I asked, Bob, 
and it doesn't look anything's 
right -right into the Sun. 
I'm sure

it's normal, 
it's just

of opinion down here is that 


Tape 77A/36 
CDR-EVA Yes, that's probably the best place in the world 
to get a consensus of opinion from. Okay, Jack, 
it's about work time. I've got this Rover about 
ready for -your pull up there. 
DMP-EVA I got a little delayed here. 
CDR-EVA Okay. I'm sure glad those guys made us train so 
hard. 
I_P-EVA Okay. The MESA's up. Let me know when you're 
ready to deploy. 
CDR-EVA Okay. Babe, I am -I am ready for you. Everything 
I can see looks pretty good. The walking hinges, 
you will be glad to know, are intact. They did 
not drop. 
04 18 45 12 CC Roger. That's a first. 
L_-EVA You want me to go up there and do that, huh? 
CDR-EVA Yes, sir. The beginning. 
LMP-EVA You ready for me to deploy? 
CDR-EVA Okay. Let me Just doublecheck. Drape, contingency, 
unstow aft deployment cable, verify walking hinge, 
forward and aft chassis parallel. They are. 
LMP-EVA MESA insulation is not coming off as easy as in 
training. 
CDR-EVA Okay. Outrigger cables are taut. Looking good 
to me. Yes, Jack. You can go on up. Go on up. 
LMP-EVA 0kay. 
CDR-EVA I'm ready for you. Gosh, that LM is a pretty sight. 
Challenger, you're a beauty. 
LME-EVA Well, let's see how good I am. 
CDR-EVA Don't drop that. Let me get that thing again. 


Tape 77A/B7 
CDR-EVA Yes, sir. (Laughter) Yes, sir. You're pretty 
agile there, twinkle toes. 
LMP-EVA You bet your -life I am. 
CDR-EVA All I asked you to do was pull that handle up 
there. Man, ar4vthing you grab, Jack -I just 
grabbed this lanyard that was in the dust -is 
really black. 
LMP-EVA You ready? 
04 18 46 29 CDR-EVA Go. She fell, Houston. She's open. 
LMP-EVA Okay. You've got parallel chassis; the wheels 
look good on this side. 
CDR-EVA Okay. They're good on this side. Let's get done. 
Let's get it out. 
CDR-EVA I'll wait for you to get the deploy cable. I'll 
tell you, Jack, this place is not locally level. 
LMP-EVA You -you're right. 
CDR-EVA Okay. There's not -there's not many places you 
could put the LM down and have it be zero, zero, 
zero. Okay. I'm ready if you are. 
LMP-EVA I don't know how much help I'm going to be. 
CDR-EVA Well, I'm starting; you pull. It's coming. It's 
coming. It's coming, baby. How's your wheels on 
that side? Can you see them: Mine look good. 
LMP-EVA Wheels; they looked good a minute ago. I got the 
Sun, so I can't tell much --
CDR-EVA Okay. 
CDR-EVA Eeee. The only way to do it. 
LMP-EVA I'm putting all my weight (laughter).

going to pop here.

in the walking hinges. I wish you could see it.

though. We ought to pull them up before we -

CDR-EVA Well, we're deploying it at an angle. Okay. The 
outrigger cables are free, Jack. 
LMP-EVA Okay. Got a different breed of rock up here. The 
stuff's sticking through this thin regolith -or 
regolith, period. I don't know whether it's thin 
or thick yet (singing). Okay. Mine's free. 
CDR-EVA Let me get this -let me get all this cable out 
of the way. Otherwise, I'll -is that enough of 
this stuff? I don't like all that over there .... 
LMP-EVA A geologist's paradise, if I ever saw one. Boy, 
you certainly are changing the color of that cable, 
sir. 
CDR-EVA Yes. Just tried a John Young trick. 
_P-EVA Did it work? 
CDR-EVA Yes. (Laughter). 
LMP-EVA You're getting dirty. 
CDR-EVA But, I'm still getting my balance. I didn't touch 
the ground. Just got to get some of this cable 
out of here. 
LMP-EVA I'm not sure my pockets are going to be accessible. 
CDR-EVA Man, I'll tell you, I don't know how long this 
line to pull the Rover out is, but -
CDR-EVA Well, I'll tell you, it sure is easy to get dusty, 
but that's nothing new to anybody. Okay, Babe, 
let me get -Wheel 
04 18 50 32 LMP-EVA I think it's safe to say this surface was not 
formed yesterday. There is a regolith; it looks 
classic. Area distribution of particles up to 
3 or 4 centimeters, anyway. Then, you start to 
get maybe a selective distribution of large fragments. 
Got that cable?

how far -oh, you can't see. You're looking. 
at the Sun. I guess about 150 meters due west of

about where I am now. I've got Trident, and 
when I get up there -We are abeam of Trident 1, 
just where I said we were. I'm right at Poppy. 
We're about -oh, 100 meters just about due -due 
west of Poppy, which is almost in line with 
Barjea, of course, but basically, on that line, 
I think, between Rudolph and Trident 1. And, as 
I look at it in the cross section, about 


100 meters -about 100 meters north of Trident 1. 
That's the landing point.

one and we'll trade cameras. Houston, I don't 
know how many of you are aware of this, but this -
this flag has flown in the MOCR since Apollo 11. 
And we very proudly deploy it on the Moon, to 
stay for as long as it can, in honor of all those 
people who have worked so hard to put us here and 
to put every other crew here and to make the 
country, United States and mankind, something 
different than it was.

some of those that work on the MOCR, we thank 
you very much.

Okay. 


Alright, looks good. You think your gravimeter's 
ready so I can go back there? 


Roger, 17. The gravimeter's ready and a couple of 
words here. One, I presume you found the scissors, 
right? 

Yes, sir. 
Okay. Two Not 
Eon's, we found ours. 
Roger. And the second thing is we do want the 
SRC closed. And if you can partially latch it, 
I'm not sure tha't easily done, that would be one 
solution. The other would be to put something 
on top of it to hold it closed. 
Okay, Bob. I'll find something 
Okay, copy that. One of the brackets off the MESA 
would be something, or a rock that's nearby; that's 


another possibility.

CC I presume you're talking about the big bag, Gene. 
CDR-EVA Yes, the big bag that was on the ladder. That's 
all it needs. It's just a little bit. There's just 
enough spring force in it. Okay, Houston. I think 
you've had all the good words about the LM. We 
have never flown a better LM. I guess that's safe 
enough to say. The quads look great. The old 
steerables are aimed right at you. Rendezvous 
radar's in good shape. It's parked -looks like 
parallel to Z. Just about perfectly. There's no 
visible -I'm on the 3 o'clock position, plus Y. 
No visible contamination. There's a little bit of 
discoloration of the plume shield below the 
thrusters. The engine bell never touched the 
ground. It's about -15 centimeters off the ground.

behind. 


That agrees more or less with the way we read it. 


Gene had a little forward motion as I think you 
heard his call. And that shows up in the forward 
footpad at any rate or did. It looks like he may 


have hit tail first a little bit. That's embedded 


to the full pad depth. I see no -By George, Gene_

that thing. 


I stroked what? 


The rear -the rear landing gear. 


Well, we can measure it and find out.

about a typical Navy landing, but I'm not sure

I picked up an example of the kind of gabbro I was 


talking about. And I'll stick it in the big bag,

could see it from where we are, I know you'd feel

orbit. 


Hey, hey, Bob. Hey, Bob. 


Go. 

Can the LSG -the base of the LSG, be touching 
the soil? 


Stand by on that. Roger, Jack. 


Well, it's very soft and it's going to be very 
hard to level for it. 


Roger, Jack. The base can be touching the ground. 


Okay. It's level, aligned, the sunshield is 
shaded inside. The level bubble is just touching 
the outer circle; a one circle. And I improved 
that. It's perfectly centered now and I'm going 
to uncage. Whoops. I moved -the experiment 
moved. It's still pretty good level. Okay, it's 
uncaged; the gimbal is swinging. 


Okay. Copy that.

here. There's enough soil here to level almost 
anything. 


But that's so soft, though, it's hard to get a fast 
level. Whoops! That's strange. I think I 
did something wrong. 


What's that? 


Pulled the pin at the wrong time ... 


Okay. The heat flow is level; the gnomon is

down to a hundred -and maybe a sukosh 120 under, 
so maybe those batteries are cooling off.

pull pin 2. Pin 2 always comes after -goes before 
pin 1. 
LMP-EVA I think that's in the NASA documents now. 
CDR-EVA What's that? 
LMP-EVA Pin 2 comes before pin 1. 
CDR-EVA (Laughter) Okay. 
LMP-EVA Reel 3 comes before reel i and 2, also. I think 
I overdid that one. 
CC Yes, it went clean out of sight; but by all means, 
watch reel 2. 
LMP-EVA (Laughter) Oh, you think you're so clever. Believe 
it or not, Bob, I'm anchoring the geophone

you're going to clean that

-And, Geno, you're leaning pretty heavy forward 
on that drill.

Okay, Bob. She went in -she's going in like she's 


in some pretty dead stuff, and then I hit some 


rock here. I'll watch it -I won't lean forward. 


I'm not putting too much pressure on it. 


CC 
Okay. 


CDR-EVA 
It sounds to me like she's chippering away through 
rock. May be Just a little longer drilling hole 
than it was at the Cape.

Bob, she's going in -but not without a little bit 
of resistance.

Roger. We're observing that, Geno.

she breaks through a soft spot.

Good.

on it now. 


LMP-EVA 
It's Just too soft. 



Tape 79A/11 
CDR-EVA Boy, that sure was drilling in hard stuff because 
it took a lot to get it off. 
CC Okay, Jack. And we could certainly stand a little 
bit of dust, at least on top of that central station 
sunshield. 
LMP-EVA Yes, I guess the level's important. 
CC Roger. 
CDR-EVA I can just see what John's thinking right now. 
That's what makes the difference. That's where 
you expendyour energy. 
LMP-EVA Bob, I don't know that I'm going to be able to do 
that without a lot of time. It's hanging against 
the south edge. 
CC Say again there, Jack. 
LMP-EVA I don't know whether I'm going to be able to level 
it -the central station. 
CDR-EVA Anything I can do, Jack? 
LMP-EVA Okay. I got it off the edge. 
CC Okay; maybe we better Just leave it there. 
LMA°-EVA Well, I'm making it worse by getting dust on the 
top. 
CC No, the dust on the top is not as important as 
getting it leveled, Jack. But if you get it 
broken off the edge, that ought to be good enough. 
04 20 59 02 CDR-EVA Bob, I'm riding at about 382. I've got -oh, I 
guess, about 80 -Well, no, there's half -I 
guess, 60 percent; no flags and no tones. 
CC Okay. Copy that, Geno.

made up. 
CDR-EVA Hey, Bob, it's obvious that I'm going through some 
pretty stuff -tough stuff. Consolidated material, 
like rock fragments, and then it breaks through; 
and then it Jumps for about 3 or 4 inches and then 
I hit some more fragments. 
CC Roger. We're seeing that Geno. Looks interesting. 
LMP-EVA Oh, me. I got too low on that one. I thought I 
had that gaged. 
CDR-EVA If you deploy that geophone, you'll go out of 
sight. 
CDR-EVA Bob, there would be absolutely no way of breaking 
this drill from that -those bores without that 
tool, I guarantee you that. 
CC Okay. We copy that, Geno. 
CDR-EVA I think I found a way to get this off, though, with 
a little help. Okay, number 3 coming up. 
CC Roger. The third and last one on this hole. 
CDR-EVA Yes, sir. Oh, boy. Time out. 
CC Okay. 
LMP-EVA Don't work too hard. 
CC Roger. 
CDR-EVA My fender's still on, which makes me happy. I'll 
tell you, if you could come and sprinkle the whole 
area with water and get rid of some of this dust -
CC Okay, Geno. And can you remember if those heat 
flow cables are not crossed as they come out of that 
box? 
CDR-EVA Yes, sir. I very definitely made a point of them -
not crossing them. 
CC 0kay; very good.

LMP-EVA Oh, slow. This leveling is really throwing me 
behind the power curve; but I know they -they're 
serious about it, so -If I can keep it where it 
is now, I'm in like Flynn. It's perfectly centered. 
Even the gnomon is aligned within a shadow 
width. 
CDR-EVA Man, is that thing biting. 
I_P-EVA Really working down there, are you? 
CDR-EVA Oh, you betcha, man. I'm in something tough down 
there now. Whew.

running -If that drill kept running and I wasn't 
anchored to the ground --
LMP-EVA (Laughter) 
CDR-EVA -It would throw me over a massif -in tangential 
turns.

CC Gene, if its getting really tough and you're not 
making much progress, we'll be happy with it 
where it is.

Geno, can you give us a distance estimate to that? 
Does it look like it's 80 feet or so? 


Yes. 


Okay. Then that sounds good. 


Oh, shucks. Hey, Bob, is there any way a level 
bubble can fail (laughter)? 


Hey, Jack, remember that's on top of those wobbly 
legs and -or wobbly springs there. And with the 
thing not being straight, you shouldn't really 
expect the level bubble to be level after the 
thing's been deployed. That happened at the Cape 
a couple of times, remember? 


Yes, but Bob, I've -I've moved this practically 


all the way down the full throw and it -That 
bubble won't move, and I can't get it to move by 
tilting it; and I was level. And the bubble on 


the top of the central station is still level. 


Okay. You're talking about the level on your 
other one, huh? Stand by on that. 


The gnomon, yes -Both of them? I can't get it 
to move to the other side of the -fluid. 


Keep working. That -that thing shouldn't fail. 


Well, I've gone full throw -


That's not level.

Question is, if there isn't they want a reading

I'll go prove it, Bob. I'll go by there. Stand 
by. 
Okay. 


What's the other question? 
And the second question is, is there a decal and 
was it aligned on the ... the 20-degree decal on 


the LSG. Was that also aligned? 


Yes, sir. 
Okay. Copy that. 
The orange one.

word from the Cape to prove to people that there's 
a decal on the LEAM, so you don't have to go back

that why don't we just take two stereo pans for 
the ALSEP photos. First stereo pan will be in 
the vicinity of the original stereo pan; and the 
second one, they suggested, will be to the northwest

I'm at the SEP site, and I found a place I think

Okay, Jack, and when you lay it down there, we 
want to put it down with the gnomon side, the side 
you're going to face, you want to put that facing 
away from the Sun. We found out a thermal constraint 
this evening, Just as the EVA started. 


Okay. Away from the Sun. Gnomon -you want the

Okay. Copy that, Geno. And how about giving me 
amp-hours and batteries just as long as you're 
there? 


Yes, sir, it's coming at you. Amp-hours are ll2

right? 
Yes, sir; going to RESET. 
Okay. Jack, you can be getting on. You won't 


need a bomb, and I guess you won't need the LMP

bomb at Steno. 


(Laughter) I thought we were playing it by the

the plan, guys. We're going to go to the west 
side of Steno, which is where you would have driven 
by anyway, and the stop is -will be at the 340/1.2, 
which is where you've got the little Delta for

spending about 30 minutes there sampling primarily 
boulders. 
LMP-EVA Okay, Geno, west side of Steno there. 
CDR-EVA Okay. I got it here. Okay --
LMP-EVA You got a good feeling on how to head out of here? 
CDR-EVA Yes. I want to get around the back side -now that 
I'm down there, on the back side of Trident, and 
make sure that that's what I'm looking at, is 
Trident over there. 
LMAO-EVA Okay, let me try to get on this thing. 
CC Okay. And, 17, Just to fill you in a little bit 
more here. We're looking at a 6 plus 45 EVA. 
We've given you 15 minutes to drive to station l; 
30 minutes at station l; and 15 minutes to drive 
back to the SEP, and then deploying the $EP for 
22 minutes. And then a 40-minute closeout at 
6 plus 45. 
CDR-EVA I'm sorry, Bob. After 30 minutes at station l, 
what did you say? 
CC Okay. Then we're going to drive back. There's a 
15-minute return to the SEP site, and then 22 minutes 
at the SEP site to deploy the SEP, and then 
return to the LM in 45 minutes for the closeout.

LMP-EVA Okay, Bob; we're about 15 meters from a 20-meter 
blocky rimmed crater. It's about B -B to 4 meters 
deep. All the blocks on the rim look like the 
pyroxene, plagioclase gabbro -the vesicular 
rocks seen at the LM. At least all that I've 
seen so far. 
CC Okay. I copied that, Jack. And is this crater to 
the east or west? 
04 23 27 01 LMP-EVA It's to the northwest of the Rover. 
CC Okay; copy that. 
LMP-EVA The vesicu -visicle popula -the vesicle population 
varies from about a 2 milli -a millimeter to 
i centimeter. It forms about 15 percent of the rock -
l0 to 15. And I've given you grain size and -

This last one has got to be the height of trivia. 


I'm just going to read it to you exactly the way 
it is. It's from Saigon. Question? What does 


an Air Force enlisted man do when he meets a naked 


general? He salutes. An order issued by Major 


Paul M. Boseman at Tan Son N-hut Air Base makes the

Okay; you're right. Okay, here we go. I'm

Okay, Houston. The location is in about the least 
cratered area I could find, between a large crater 
or a large depression that's about -oh, ranges 


from maybe 50 to 150 meters behind the LM. That's 
maybe -south -or east-southeast; and it's between 


that depression and another large depression that 
is really a doublet with a blocky septum between 


them. That's to the northeast of the LM about 


200 meters; that's the start of that second 


depression. I think we can get a nice layout, 
although there'll be a general slope, I believe, 
towards the LM -of about 1 degree. 


Okay, that's no real problem, Jack. No problem, 
Jack. 


Jack, am I about abeam of you? I can't see. 


Yes. 


Okay, I'll turn in around this crater. 


Hey, if you come right 


That depression to the northeast is at least a 
couple hundred meters in diameter, and it's Joined 
with one that's probably of comparable size Just 
to the northwest of the first depression.

thick. One -one face is very flat; looks like it 


was off of a parting plane, which were in that rock. 


Okay, and if it fits in the $RC with all the other 
s_mples, you might put it there because the SRC's 
going to be kind of empty. 


Got any new parking angles for your batteries or 
anything? 


No, it will be a heading of 0lB, which is hardly 
a change at all from the 012 in the checklist. 


Okay, I'll buy that. 


Jack, did you copy my comments about putting 
that thing in the SRC perhaps? 


Well, it was pretty big. It's in the big bag now. 
We can do that. 


Well, I'd get-the other samples -the small ones 
and particularly soils in the SRC first.

--one thing we'd like before you guys leave the

Just a piece of the flange -the rail that fits 
against the fender -but that doesn't hold any part 


of the fender on. I don't remember what I saw on 


the fender -The rails look pretty good, Bob. And 
I had one of them completely on, and I Just couldn't 
get the other one on. If I had known what that dust 
was, I would have tried an awful lot harder. 


Okay, do you have any feeling that -


I heard John telling me, but -


Do you have any feeling that you could get away 
with putting a front fender on? 


Well, I have done it before, but it's not easy.

at it over night, the rear fender -the part that's 
remaining -looks in fairly good shape, right?

some surface block data. Then we're going to 
read up to you a LEVA cleaning procedure which is 
fairly simple, a real short geology debrief, a 
one-line change in the Lunar Surface Checklist. 
And then, we've been doing some thinking down here 
about how to fix the fender. And it's going to 
involve, we think, although we'll work on it while 
you guys are getting some rest, it's going to 
involve using utility clamps, from inside your LM 
there, instead of tape, to fasten some sort of 
stiff material onto the Rover in place of the 
missing fender. And we'll go with either with 
one of your -your cue cards, or possibly with 
part of insulation that, was the flame blanket 
protecting the Rover during the landing. Or 
perhaps part of the packing material that was 
between the Rover wheel and is probably lying on 
the ground underneath the LM there.

Joe, you couldn't be reading our mind more. We 


were talking about that, and there is a piece of 
it right outside nV window. I saw it after we 
got in here. Either that or back of a part of a 
data book or something -I hate like the devil to 


tear one of those other fenders off. And the 


reason tape won't stick is that everything's got 
a fine coating of dust, and the only way I could 
finally get it to sti_ was to put tape on it rip 
the tape off -or take the tape off -which 
took some of the dust off and then tape would 
tend to hold it. But it Just won't hack it up 


here. 


Roger, Gene. That's exactly what we're thinking. 
And what we're going to do is run through the fix 
in a pressure suit a few hours from now. And if it 
looks like we can do it, and it won't cost you many 
more than say l0 minutes, we're going to have you 
go through with it. If it takes longer than that, 
we're going to go back to the drawing board and 


see what else 
we can do here. 


Well, you know John and Charlie can tell you Just

a little harder to make sure that fender was going 
to stay on. But it -Man, Just that short -trip

Okay, Joe, you can go ahead and fire away at the

Okay, Jack, and for the geology questions. I'm 
going to turn the console over to the well-known 
geologist of the Seifort Galaxies. 


Can't hack it, huh? You've all forgotten everything 
I taught you. 


I draw my sword. 


Okay, guys, you want me to address first those to 
Gene -those to Jack, and then address them to 
Gene later on, or you guys both want to answer them 


at the same time? 


Well, we're both listening. We can answer them. 


Okay, the way you asked that, I wasn't sure. 


Okay. Question number 1 is -concerns the Rover 
mobility rate. The Rover mobility rates over the 
short span you drove, which is hardly representative, 
are slower than people had anticipated. 
Do you think this is due to visibility_ terrain, 
or what? Do you think you can still hack a 7.3 or 
8-kilometer minimum or average to Station 2 
tomorrow? 


The answer to that is yes, Bob. I think it's 
partly -partly faa, but it's also the fact that 
we did a lot of circling. We didn't drive in many 


straight lines. Trying to find, for the most part, 
our bearings, amd tried to pick some high spots 
so we could look around. So I think straight-line 
navigation out in the area we're going is going 
to be easily 8 kilometers. 


0k_y, great. 0kay. Another question here, Gene, 


that you should be able to answer with a simple 
yes or no. Was there any spillage of the material 
in the drill core while y_a were breaking it down? 



f-


Tape 83A/7 
CDR-LM Simple no. 
CC Okay. And --
CDR-I24 Spillage out of it? 
CC --Yes, you know, when you broke the sections, 
did you lose much material out of it? 
CDR-LM No, sir; I didn't lose any. 
CC Okay, next simple question. When you were drilling 
the deep core where the neutron probe was, could 
you see the RTG over the rock? 
CDR-LM Yes. 
CC Okay. You have any feel for how high the rock is 
or how low -how deep the thing was with respect 
to the -with respect to the RTG? Where you down 
in a level that was below, even without the rocks 
being there? 
05 03 48 l0 CDR-LM Yes, I think I -yes. I was in a -in a slump. 
There was a ridge between us and the RTG, and I 
had the rock in a line of sight between it and 
where I put that core. And I'd say the rock was 
certainly near the ridge and it was -what, Jack? -
I don't know was it meter to -meter high for the 
most part. And it sloped off, and I'd say at 
least a half a meter high in the line of sight 
from where the neutron probe is to the -to the 
RTG. Plus, there's a lot of undulations -I think 
it 'll be below the line of sight, anyway. 
CC Okay. And a somewhat more general question, here. 
It says -and I'll read it. We're still puzzled 
as to whether there is a dark mantle. Could you 
say something more about the dark regolith surface? 
There's a lot of discussion, today, about whether 
or not it could have been a regolith derived from 
the intermediate gabbro which you were sampling 
as boulders.

Bob, I -I think I don't have too much to add to 
what I said, near the end of the EVA, is that I 


do not have an intuitive feeling that the regolith 
has been derived from most of the boulders that 
we're seeing. But -because those boulders are 


fairly light-colored, they look like they're 
probably 50 percent plagioclase. The -it could 
be that the regollth is derived from some other 
material that has blanketed the area. I don't 


think we have that answer, yet. 


Okay. I copy that. 


Bob, the boulders -the boulders we are sampling I 
thi_ Jack and I both feel that it's probably we 
feel we sampled the subfloor because we saw 


on the sides of the craters where some of these 


boulders were exposed _lmost as if theywere 


bedrock down there. In driving back from what we 


called Station l, we -we could definitely see the 


light mantle out in the area where the potentials 


of aslide are. 


Okay, very good. Yes, I think that the -At least, 


it's a going bet around here that we're sampling 


the subfloor when we're sampling -at least the 
top of the subfloor when we're sampling the 


intermediate gabbro there. The rocks and the 


boulders. 


Okay. We also -


Yes, the 


Go ahead.

Go. 


It is sort of strange that we don't see a good 
population of fine -of finer-grained rocks. These 
rocks look very much like igneous rocks, but 



Tape 8BA/9 
they're considerably coarser than comparable -
well, they're about the grain size of some of the 
coarse-_ain Mare basalts that tend to differentiate 
the crystallobalite and trid_mite -but we 
didn't see any of the finer-grain versions. If 
it's an intermediate crystalline rock, we have not 
seen any fine-grain equivalents yet. At least not 
in abundance. 
CC Okay, I copy that. 
CC We get -we gather that there's no color change in 
the dark-mantle material at depth. In other words, 
the footprints, wheel tracks, and the rake sample, 
et cetera, were sort of uniform in color. 
LMP-LM No, there's

no major change, but looking out the

CDR-LM Yes, Bob, both in the core and the heat flow holes, 
it really didn't -didn't seem to pile it up like 
you're accustomed to it at the Cape, and I guess 
mRybe that's because I was kicking so much dust 
around there. But I looked specifically when I 
cleared flutes, and what have you, and I didn't 
see any difference in terms of color, texture, or 
anything else coming up.

On the -%he outcrops you think you see in the 
North and South Massifs, do they appear to be 
linear horizontal, or subhorizontal? Can you see 
ls_vers, and do you have any feel for the thickness 
or the attitude or the continuity of them? Can you 


discuss these outcrops? 


Bob, the -gQi_ugpver yesterday, I thought I could 
see a -a structure dipping off to the southeast, 


apparent dip anyway, on the eastern side of the 


South Massif. Or northeastern side. We haven't 


exAmi_ed them in detail because we were in a rush 
to get out. We' 11 put the binoculars on them and 
try to ex-_ue that question. There's nothing 
very obvious, any more than you can see on the 


photos, that the ledges were concentrated in the 
upper portion (cough) -excuse me -in the upper 
portion of the Massif's units. 


Okay. We copy that. Here's a short one that I'll 


ask Jack since he did it. Again I guess we'll 
have to prove this -the shade portion of the 


cosmic ray experiment. The question is, and I 
repeat -I quote -"Are you sure that the 


detectors, not the decals, were facing out?" 


IAm, Bob, because I said I was sure, and I called 
you on it.

question.

Tape 83A/11 
CC Okay, the next question which calls for a little 
bit of discussion is: The layers of lineaments 
that you remarked on in the Sculptured Hills, can 
you say anything about them? 
CDR-LM Yes, Bob, I did. I think I said -and I commented, 
I'm not sure whether it was the Sun angle or not, 
but see, I was not looking at the Sculptured Hills. 
I was looking back at Bare Mount_, I believe. 
And, to me it looked like there was some organization 
that was dipping back to the east, somewhere 
between, oh, 20 and 25 degrees maybe. And it was 
very obvious to me but I'm a little -a little 
hesitant because of some of this Sun-angle stuff. 
CC Okay, I copy that. I gather we didn't get any 
500-millimeters of these lineations, that right? 
_-_ CDR-LM No, but I think we will. I -they were on the 
western side of Bare Mountain back there, and I 
th_nk I commented that I thought that Bare Mountain 
is probably what the Sculptured Hills look like.

light mantle material? In other words the slide, 
is there a scar above that on the South Massif?

the question's about a crater.

You're right. You're right, there was a large 


zap pit in a boulder that was very white. It mast 
have been -the crater for the zap mst have been 
2 centimeters diam-ter anyway. And it had about 
that, or maybe S-centimeters worth of crushed 
minerals around it, that gave it a white, very 
bright white appearance. 


Okay. Well that was indeed a sm_ll crater, so I 
guess the question was right. 


Let me change the mode here and ask you three or 
four simple _LqEP questions again, to verify for 
various people, exactly what happened. Just to 
make sure that they're clear on it. When -Jack, 
when you were laying out the geophone leads, you 
mentioned and asked me if it was all right if the 
geophone leads crossed one another, if there was 
EMI problems. And so that made people wonder 
whether or not it was possible the geophone 
positions were reversed; i.e., geophone i was laid 
out in geophone 2s' direction, et cetera. 


No, that was Just a geophone _ problem. The 
geophones are in the right directions. 


Okay. 


Geophone 4 fell out of the module and rolled under 
one of the other lines, or vice versa, I don't 
know which, and it was -it's crossing one of the 
other lines, geophone l, I think. 


Okay, no problem. Was the -When you went to put 


the LSPE antenna in the heat-flow socket, you 


didn't have -weren't able to do it at first, was 


it because of there was a lot of dust in there? 


No, I think it was the same old problem of that 


piece of -of al_m_num foil or whatever it is 


going down in the socket and Jammtng briefly. 



Tape 83A/13 
CC Okay, I copy that. Did you clear out that foil 
when you did it, or did you Just push it on 
through? 
LMP-LM I pushed it. 
CC Okay. When you taped the SEP solar cells down, 
did you -how much of them did you cover with 
tape? 
LMP-LM We taped the back. 
CC Ah, very good thinking. And, Geno, a question for 
you on the Rover when you parked it. Do you have 
any feeling for the roll angle it was parked at 
,/ the I247 The roll angle? 
CDR-LM Here let me look. Bob, it's pretty flat. If I 
had to guess, Itd say zero. And you can bias that 
· by a degree or so, but basically zero. 
CC Okay, is the pitch scale still on it, or did it 
fall off yet? 
CDR-LM No. I was going to comment on that. It's still 
there. 
CC Okay, very good. Okay, when you went to 
Station· lA, we're calling the new Station i -
Station lA, were the blocks there as well-filleted 
as those near the I_ and the ALSEP? Do they all 
look the same? 
CDR-LM Bob, they -All the boulders had filleting to a 
slight degree, but not au extreme amount. I think 
it no more than what is being caused by the 
redistribution of the darker, fine-grained regolith. 
CC Okay, I copy that.

--if I had to answer that question, I'd sa_ yes. 


Yes that the fillet -boulders are filleted over 
there about like they are over here. That would 
be my impression. 


Ail right. Is there any indication that the 


fillets are directional, in other words, that the 


fillets are heavier on one side than the other? 


Bob, haven't noticed that. 


Okay, I copy that. Do you have the feeling that 
some boulders are more rounded -' 


Well that's a good --that's a good 


Roger. I agree with that. 


That's a good re -that's a good reminder, Bob. 


Okay, do have any feeling that some boulders are 
more rounded than others? Apparently this looked 
this way in some of the TV pictures ° 


Some of the big ones that are Just barely expose_ 


above the regolith looked quite well-rounded. 
Most of those around the craters are subangular. 
I think -I got the impression that it's Just 
purely a function of how long the same material's 
been exposed; but some of the big boulders like 
the one out near the geophones is quite angular 
in part and quite rounded on other parts. It's 
quite variable. 


Okay, do you want to say any more about that 


boulder? Did it seem to have more or less the 


sa_ morphology, in addition to the variation in 


vesicle size that the other rocks in the vicinity 


of the ALSEP, and the other rocks out at Station 1 


had? 


It's very comparable to the ones that we saw at 


Station l, as a matter of fact. 



Tape 8_/15 
CC Okay, I copy that. 
CDR-L_4 Both types of rocks were there, both variations. 
CC Do you have a feeling for where the big blocks in 
the LM ALSEP area came from? Do you think they 
were from Camelot, like I've been saying? 
LMP-LM Don't have an idea yet_ I'm really not sure. 
CC Okay, and as you drove along on the traverse from 
the SEP to Station l_ did the size of the small 
craters with blocky rims vary? In other words, 
what we are looking for here is the variation in 
the thickness of the ds_k E_ntle? 
LMP-I_M I can't answer that one yet, Bob_ 
CC Okay. Let me sum up by saying, that I guess as I 
indicated before, our best guess is that the 
vesicular crystalline rock, probably gabbro, or I 
think you've been calling it intermediate basalt 
or gabbro, forms at least the upper part of the 
subfloor. I don't think we've been close enough 
to a large crater rim to say that it's a -what 
the deep sections of the subfloor form, but we 
think that this intermediate gabbro vesicular 
rock, at least medi_-grained, perhaps coarse-
grained rock, forms at least the upper lsyer of the 
subfloor. Over. 
LMP-LM Yes, Bob, I think that's pretty safe, right now. 
Once again, I'm surprised that it's _ coarse as 
it is, that being the upper portion of a plains 
unit. 
CC Roger. 
CDR-LM Say, Bob, driving back from Station l, driving back 
from Station l, where we did some of our circling 
and what have you. We didn't have time to get off,

done anything today that is going to make us change 
very much from the nominal station of -nominal 
EVA-2 plans. _e fact we didn't get the station to 
the EVA-1 at the large boulders at Ew_ry is 
probably going to mean that Station 5 might be 
shifted a little bit to the boulders on Camelot. 
But certainly Station 5 on the subfloor and also 


to Station 10 have ass,,-_d a higher priority than 
they originally had. Other than that I, don't

05 04 07 39 CC As far as I could tell, Geno, it did. As a matter 
of fact, I didn't see the gravimeter people afterwards 
to talk to them. But as far as I could tell, 
it did. We had one funny reading back at the LM 
very early when it was on the ground, which I'm 
at a loss to understand right off. But other than 
that everything seems to have gone very well. The 
readings were quite uniform in fact, which makes 
me think they went well. 
CDR-LM Okay, well, I'd like to leave it -You know it's 
a little change in my thinking -I'd like to leave 
it on the Rover if we can, although it's a piece

taking your -your readings and what have you.

That's got it. And I've got a LEVA-cleaning 
procedure which maybe you could pencil in there. 
It's an easy three-step procedure. And I'll go 
ahead and read it step-by-step here. Step number 
i is tap LEVA base to remove loose dust. 
Step number 2 reads: If excess dust still remains, 
use a towel from the LM tissue dispenser, 
which has been wetted with water, and gently 
wipe the visor from the top to the bottom; that 
is, in one direction. And fold this towel after 
each wipe to keep the contact surface clean. 


There's a note. "Take care not to wet the inside 


that is, the concave surface of the gold visor." 
And the last step is: Allow it to air-dry. And 
that's it on the LEVA cleaaing. 


Okay, Joe, we got that. The Commander's PLSS 
has had its final charge, and we're in the process 
of working on the LMPs PLSS now. I guess there's 
no way to verify how much water you've got in

Okay, Jack and Gene. And, unless you've got 


questions, or we can help you out in some way, 


we'll say good night to you. 


Good morning. 


The reason I say that, Joe, it's going to be 


another 30 minutes or so anyway before we probably 
more like an hour before we actually 


close our eyes. 


Roger, Gene. You think you'll be able to use 


about 30 more minutes of sleep tomorrow morning? 


What's your wish on that? 


Yes, I'd like to try to get the full amount. As 


I recall, tomorrow's a little bit flexible. If 


we get up 30 minutes late, it doesn't really 


hurt us. 


Sounds like a good way to proceed. We'll give 


you the full 8 hours. Good night, Geno. And, 
you do have a time pad in there, so it shouldn't 
hurt a thing. 


Yes, as long -the big object tomorrow is to get 
out, and get back in, and the same thing with the 
next day. I don't think we're really that time 


critical either day that we can't go an hour 
either way. And I think we'd prefer to have the 
full 8 tonight. 


Roger. We couldn't agree with you more. And if 
there's anyway we can be helping you now, Just 


speak up. 


No, you've been doing -doing fine. We just got 
a little housecleaning we got to do that's going 
to take us -I expect we'll be an hour late, Joe.

LMP-LM Some ambiguity in your statement. You want us 
to use a tissue or a towel on that visor cleaning? 
CC Jack, they call it -they call it a towel, but it 
comes from the LM tissue dispenser, so I would 
interpret that to mean tissue. 
LMP-LM Well, you and I are thinking alike. But can you 
ask back there and find out? 
CC Asking right now. 
CC Jack, our guess was right on the cleaning of the 
visors there. We're to use a tissue from the LM 
tissue dispenser. And I've got an unrelated 
question for you. We're tracing water usage down 
here. Could you tell us, please, if you filled 
your drink dispensers -refilled the drink dispensers 
in the suit already? Over.

LMP-LM Joe, I just took a -quick look with the hand

I don't think there's much more than 30 percent 
plagioclase. I'll go back -could be more of a 
standard basalt or gabbro. It has a fair proportion 
of ilmenite in it, I believe. There's a

ilmenite. Now it could be that the glass -if 
the soil is very glassy, that it's developed the

the front side of one of the parting planes that 
I mentioned. Very, very sharply bounded on one 


side by a planar surface. 


Roger, Jack. Say again. You may have sampled by 
accident the side -the side of what? 


No, I didn't. I mentioned when I sampled it, it 
had one very planar surface, and looking at it 
more closely, it looks like one of those parting 
planes that I talked about even earlier in the EVA.
