CC 17, read you loud and clear. 
I34P Hey, we're going real well up here, Bob. Have no 
significant anomalies as yet; and we've Just about 
completed our part of the insertion checklist. 
Gene has his SCS check yet, and Ron's got some 
P52 numbers for you. And the only thing I've seen 
so far is a -some spurious MASTER ALARMwithout 
caution and warning that seem to be associated 
with moving switches on panel 2. 
CC Okay. Can you get a sudden -what switches anywhere 
-any ... any switches on? 
LMP So far, it's been fairly random. Some that I remember 
is the SECONDARY COOLANT LOOP EVAP switch, 
the LAMP TEST switch, -see -I think I got one 
with the TEMP IN AUTO switch. Gene got one doing 
something. I can't remember exactly what it was. 
CC Okay --
LMP Probably random. 
CC --we copy. Jack, we're standing by for that P52 
data. We've only got about a 4-minute -a 5-minute

Looks like about a north-south lineation witha 


very strong crinkling, roughly east-west. 


Roger. Copy that; that's interesting. You know, 


you're Just directly over that South Atlantic area. 
Your -you -your path Just kind of kept you going 


right between the -Africa and South America, right 


dead center all the way. 


And, l?, just for your information, we've searched 


all the data we can, and we cannot find anything 
wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. 
Everything is looking real fine, and the only prob


lem in the air is that -those master alarms that 


you have reported -we're not able to tie in anything 
common yet to any of those things either. 


Okay, Bob. We have not had any for -quite some 
time, I think, since the last time we t-lked to you 
about them. 


Roger. Understand. We'll probably get a good workout 
on that after TLI and try and track it down one 
more. 


Okay. But, also, we have not really been doing much 
switching since the insertion checklist was complete, 
either. 


Roger. Understand. It's got you glued to the win-


dews, I guess, huh? 


They are interesting; I'll say that. 


Well, I certainly am, Bob, and -again there's a 


big -a fairly, continuous intermediate cloud deck, 


I think. And it has patterns comparable to what

Okay. Sounds good. That's the way they built it 
for us. 


Gene, looking at our plot board, you're directly 
over the southern tip of Africa or just slightly 
out in the Indian Ocean there, according to our 


plot board, which isn't exactly accurate all the 
time. But shortly you're going to start going 


backwards on the Earth here and head back across 


the Atlantic. That ought to be some sort of a 


first. You cross the Atlantic twice, going from 
west to east, and then, nOw you're going to cross 
it going from east to west here shortly. All in 


a very short span of time. 


Yes. I guess that does sound like a first. 


Bob, I can assume that from what you said there 
will be -probably not be a midcourse l? 


That's exactly what we're working towards, Gene. 
And I -I'm sorry I didn't convey that feeling to 
you a little earlier. There's no reason for mid-


course i right now. 


Okay. Because we prefer to press on and get the 


suits off and hit the sack rather than make it, 


unless we have to. 


That's for sure. Roger. The earlier data showed 
us midcourse 1 would have been less than 3 feet per 
second, and we wouldn't have done it. And the 
data's been fluctuating, but they're smoothing it 
out, and it's still holding that way; so we won't 
be doing it, probably. 


Okay. Very good. 


Bob, I'm looking over Gene's shoulder here at the 
Earth, and it must be an awful clear day for the 
so-called convergence zone across Africa. Gene, 
I think, indicated, as it looked to us as we 
crossed it earlier, most of Africa is clear. Only 
some -probably are broken and scattered clouds cumulus 
in the east central portion that are running 
along the line of -north/south lines.

Looks like a major circulation system off the 
southern tip of Africa, as Gene mentioned, plus 
one west of that, 20 or 30 degrees of longitude. 


Make that east of that. 


Roger. 


And, southwest of the -make that south southwest 
of the tip of Africa at Cape Good Hope, there looks 
like an incipient circulation system developing 
about half way between the coast of Antarctica 
and Africa. If I had to guess, it's going to swing 
up north towards the Cape and -and then swing west. 
The whole pattern, ... it looks like now, is a 
fairly equally spaced cyclones that are sort of 
circling around the Antarctic continent, as we c:n_ 


see it now. 


Roger, Jack. 


But I would guess that South Africa is going to 


have good weather for several more days, at least. 


And if the pattern is -is apparent in the clouds 


we see is correct, the last disturbance I mentioned 


probably is going to pass south of the Cape also. 


Roger. Understand. 


As we were going -over our daylight around the 


Earth in orbit, it was very clear looking at the 


various clouds, Bob, what were high clouds and 


what were low clouds, particularly when you had 


them together. The high clouds cast very distinct 


shadow patterns on the lower ones and, very 


commonly, had entirely different orientations 


pattern orientations. The low ones seem to be more 


associated with arcuate front patterns; whereas, 


the high clouds were generally transverse to that, 


roughly north/south directions. That's not com


pletely general observation, but I noticed it 


several times. 


Roger. Understand. 


I just noticed on the plot board here, it looks 


like you're come up on 20,000 miles out, right 


about now.

or is possible, at 6 o'clock. There's nothing 
sacred about that time, is there? 


Nothing at all. Whenever you're ready, just go 


ahead and dump. 


Okay. 


Bob, one of the things that we miss in our training 
is a good geography lesson, and particularly on 
Antarctica. I got the monocular out, and apparently 
the dark band that Gene -Ron mentioned as 


interface between the continental water is that 
between the pack ice and the water. And you can, 
by very subtle changes in the apparent smoothness 
of the ground, probably make out where the actual 
continent begins and the pack ice ends. There are 
a few exposed ranges. I guess it's midsummer down 
there now, and you can make out the snow-free areas 


scattered at least in the northern portion of th_ 


continent. 


Roger. Did you get any pictures of that, Jack? 


Oh, yes. We got some pictures earlier. I'm going 


to get another one here in a minute. I'll tell

CC Roger. 
LMP But you can see patterns of what I believe is 
pack ice -leading off from that sharp interface 
that was talked about earlier. And those patterns 
seem to merge directly with the patterns of the 
clouds as if the -at least near the continent -
the oceanic currents are controlling the air currents, 
up to a point, along with the movement of 
the pack ice.

I'm distinguishing the pack ice from clouds mainly 
by the angularity of the patterns within them. 
There is no good clear color or albedo distinction. 
So, I could -I could be looking entirely at clouds, 
but I suspect there are some pack ice patterns, 
too. I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob? 


No, sir. Just keep talking; we're listening. And 
I'm sure not much of the world is listening, but 
this will all be recorded, and you can read it all 
when you get back and think it through and tie it 
up with the pictures. And I'm sure there's goin_ 
to be people interested in this. And we're interested 
ourselves; Just keep talking. 


Ail I want to do is read what I say. 


Roger. If I had a little more geology training, 


I'd be asking you some better questions. I'm 
afraid, right now, I can't think of anything to 
ask you. 


Well, I can't -I really wish I knew that geography. 
I don't know -I wish I'd thought of bringing a 
good map of Antarctica. Could somebody do a little 
researching for me and see if they could tell me 
if we're -have a Little American view -say on the

Roger. We'll see if we can get some Antarctica 
geographers around. 


Yes, I'd like to -and, also, whether or not they 
think the Dry Valley area is visible to us. Let's 


see, there's some -some of the people over there 
in Bill Bennett's group, I think, have a little 
Antarctic experience, or used to. They might be 
able to help you out.

Okay. There is a good strong northern hemisphere 


cyclone up near India, and I think Gene mentioned 
that. It, I think, was one I saw in some of the 
forecast sheets as a dissipating hurricane or 
typhoon. I'm not sure which it is there. I guess 
it's a typhoon. And I see something here that I 
noticed in Earth orbit, Bob. That as you approach 


the terminator -and now I'm looking at the eastern 
terminator -have to keep all my directions straight 
here -yes, eastern terminator. The clouds -those 
associated with the cyclone over India and one 
that's -appears to be due south of there -maybe 
30 degrees of latitude -have a gray appearance. 


The -instead of the brilliant white of other 


clouds as you approach the terminator, those -at 
least the high level clouds are gray. Now, when 
we were going over them in orbit, the lower level 
clouds were still white, and I think I can see a 
hint of that right now. The Sun gives a strong 
light reflection off of the buildups in the low-
level clouds; whereas, the high-level and probably 
layered cirrus and maybe some of the intermediate 
level stratus tend to look gray because of grazing 
Sun, I suspect. 


Roger. You mentioned something in Earth orbit 


that kind of intrigued me. You mentioned seeing 


the rainbow, and we were trying to figure out how 


you saw a rainbow up there. And you were in orbit 


already at that time. Do you remember that? 


Well, -we're not -we were speaking of the merits 


of the sunrise. 


Okay. Roger. 


Of having a banded color appearance that varied as 
you approached sunrise. I can't remember what 
we -I think we put some of that on tape, and we 
were probably LOS at the time. But the banded 
character of the sunrise in the atmosphere was very, 
very marked. There was a gray-blue l_per layer 
followed -that merged or graded into a bril][ant 
blue intermediate zone that was just above thc 
cloud levels. And within the clouds, you got _ 
orange to yellow band, getting more yellow as the 
Sun rose, that was broken by the dark patterns of 
the buildups.

Roger. Good show. 


The interesting thing was the continual glow on the 
horizon we had, even at night, on the darkside pass. 
And that glow was in the atmosphere because I could 
see stars rise over the horizon in it and then pass 
on through it. 


Roger. You were talking -the airglow, I guess, is 
the phenomenon most of the guys had seen before. 
It's kind of interesting, huh? 


Yes, that's -that's right. It's interesting -I

it's a continuous thing even in the dark pass. 


Roger. 


I think I did see the eastern tip of South America, 
now. 


Roger. You're starting to back up now, coming the 
other way. So you're still over Africa, according 
to our chart heres but you're backing up towards 


the -South America. 


Yes, I can see the part of South America that 


Mercator thought that fitted in with the bend in 
Africa so many decades ago and started people 
thinking about moving continents around on the 


crust. 


Roger. Jack, how'd the PGA doffing go? Most of 
you -are you all out of the PGAs now? 


That's in work. We're taking it slow and easy 
up here, Bob. 


Roger. Understand. I'll just be curious to see 
if they all fit in that bag. 


I think you'll find that Ronald Evans will also be 
curious about that. He's already made comments. 


Roger. 


Bob, you certainly do have a very clear intuit[w_ 
impression, although the evidence is hard to pull

together, that the -any frontal systems that move 
off the Antarctic continer_ do not take on any 
well-defined character until they get into the ... 
regions of the ocean. And when they do, they seem 
to pick up an arcuate circ -circulation that, in 
the view we have, seem to get fairly regularly 
spaced cyclone patterns that lie between the C_e 
of Good Hope and northern portion of Antarctica. 
And these -circulations of cyclones follow r©ughly 
an east/west pattern, and the curve -and the arcs 


of the fronts are more north/south than -let's 
say northwest, swinging around to the south.

are about four of those visible swinging around oh,

here, but I'd say latitude 50 to 60 south. 


CC 
Okay; 50 or 60 south on that, huh? 


LMP 
Yes, I have to look at the map here in a minute 
and see if that puts me between Antarctica and the 
Cape. 


CC 
Roger. 


CC 
Well, the tip -the tip of Africa there is at 
about 32 south. 


LMP 
Well, that sounds like a pretty good guess, then. 
It looks like the intertropical convergence zone 
over Africa is starting to get more and more clouds 
in it now. I suspect as midday approaches, whi_,h 
is what we're seeing there, we can expect to see 


more and more moisture indications. 


CC 
Roger. They're -they're probably about noontime 
right there right now. It's 11:36 at the zero 
meridian at Greenwich, so it's just a little bit 
before noon right in that area you're talking 


about.

Yes, some of those masses of what I suspect are

However, if you're interested in going to South 
America, the whole continent looks -looks pretty 
good. A few clouds; but, for the most part, you 


can see the entire continent. 


Roger. Guess it's summertime down there. 


Okay, Gordo. We're -we're stirring slowly. We'll 
get back with you here. 


Okay. 


Gordo, one question. How does the spacecraft look 
to you? I didn't hear anything all night long as 
far asany MASTER ALARMs or anything. 


I'm getting the word that nothing was seen here 
either. It looks absolutely super. 


Very good. 


Okay, Bob -or Gordo, I've got H2 HEATERS i and 2, 
OFF, now. 


Roger, Gene. 


Hello, Houston; America. 


Go ahead, America. 


Okay, Gordo. I'm looking over the Flight Plan 
today. We'll be with you with the postsleep checklist, 
and primarily it looks like a P23 day for Ron. 
And what we'd primarily like to do is spend a good 
part of that time getting the spacecraft cleaned 
up, reshuffled, restowed a little bit, and get it 
in order for the next few days ahead. It doesn't 
look like today's that big of a day. 


Okay. Geno, I might give you some words on what 
we have in mind to get the GET back in sync here, 
if -if you want to hear those while you're looking 


through the upcoming hours. 


Yes, why don't you -why don't you pass a few words 
on that? 



Tape 13/3 


CC Okay. The plan we're considering, and we're 
offering it to you now for your opinion, is at 
65 hours GET, we'll update, and at the time the 
clock goes to 65, we'll update it 2 hours and 
40 minutes to 67:40. And we're shaping your trajectory 
such that you'll arrive at the Moon at the 
same time G.m.t. as you would have had you launched 
on time. In other words, your translunar time is 
2 hours and 40 minutes less. So once we do that, 
we'll be back with all the right times in the Flight 
Plan without any updating. And the one thing we 
think of is that your next day will, which is now 
a 16-hour day, will shorten to a 13-hour and 
20-minute day,. But that's about the only real effect 
we can see. How does that sound? 


CDR 
Yes, we -we'll get to the Moon, you say, the same 
G.m.t., so all our sunrise, sunset, lunar-orbit 
activities, and Sun angle at landing will be the 
same. And let me -I'll -It sounds pretty good, 


Gordo. I Just want to take a look at that day that 
you're shortening and see what we're doing in there. 


CC 
Okay. It doesn't cut out anything. In fact, we 


picked a time that's pretty much dead time as far 


as the Flight Plan goes. Take a look, and we'll 
talk about it later. 


CDR 
Okay.

Good morning, Gordy. This is Jack.

Good morning, Jack.

Let me fill my square on the postsleep checklist. 
I've got 24030, PRD.

Okay. 


LMP 
And I slept in and out -probably totaled about 


4 hours in that last period. But I feel pretty 
good in spite of that, and expect now that I've 
educated myself on how to sleep, that it'll pick 


up the next time around.

had about 3 hours of sleep, had -three 
cans of fluid -of water, that is. And he ate 
everything in meal B but the fruitcake, and he 
didn't use the brownies and the beverage in meal C. 
CC Okay. 
LMP Okay. And continuing, the CDRs PD -PRD is 17019. 
He had 3 hours of fair sleep, no medication, and 
1-1/2 cans of water, and one-half a sandwich. The 
CMPs sleep was 3 hours. And I'll try to get more 
systematic as we go along here.

That's affirm. We haven't gotten that kit out yet.

cleared up pretty well in PTC from the -ice 


crystals, anyway, that were on window -window 1. 


The hatch window still seems to have a film of 


something on 
it. But, otherwise, they look pretty 


good. 


Okay, sounds good. Jack, while you're there, I 
might try -we've been talking about consumable 
updates and what would be the most meaningful way 
to give you the information. As a trial,for 
14 hours, with reference to the charts in the back 
of the book, which in the case of -in case of all 
of them, are listed in percentages except the RCS, 
which is in pounds. On the cryo quantities, when 
I take all the tank percentages and plot them, it 
turns out that there's no real significant difference 
from the lines that are plotted on either 
hydrogen or oxygen. On RCS, you're running about 
3 percent ahead of the line. And if that's a satisfactory 
way to put it, that's the way we'll give 


you the -the updates rather than giving you every 
tank percent by percent. Over. 


Okay, that's 
good. That's outstanding. 


MARK. Two aspirin for the LMP. 


Roger, LMP. 


Jack, next time the Surgeon would like a mark on 
each individual aspirin.

the P37 block data for 35 hours. 


Well, we've got 35, 45, 55, 65. GET ignition of

a GET of 045:00, 7728, minus 177, 081:18. For a 
GET of 055:00, 5859, minus 175, 105:30. GET of 
065:00, 4703, minus 175, 129:40. 


Okay, I'll read that. Let's see, 35:00 at 532t_, 
minus 175, and 81:39. At 45:00, 7728, minus 177, 
and 81:18. At 55:00, it's 5859, minus 175, 105:30. 
At 65:00, it's 4703, minus 175, and 129:40. 


Okay, that's 
correct. I've got a maneuver pad for 


you. It's a flyby maneuver at a time of 81 hours, 


which is 5 ho_rs prior to LOI. This is required 


because you're presently on an impacting trajectory. 


And this is assuming you wouldn't do midcourse 2. 


Midcourse 2 will put you on a -on the proper tra-

CC Okay. The "VERB 49 maneuver to optics cal attitude" 
right at the top of the page. Cross out the attitude 
numbers and replace them with "Roll 164, 
pitch 301, and yaw 348 at a high-gain pitch angle 
of minus 28 and a yaw of 315." Over. 
LMP Okay; 164, 301, 348, minus 48, and 315. 
CC That's correct. Now go down a few lines to the 
sighting attitude at -one's at 17 hours and 
15 minutes. And cross out that attitude and the 
high-gain pitch angle and change to a "Roll of 
196, pitch 304, and yaw 348." High-gain pitch is 
minus 61, and the yaw remains the same, 357. Over.

out -replace the NOUN 70 numbers with star 21.

20 minutes, where it says "Optics calibration 


attitude." We got to put in the same thing as 


the same change as above. We want, instead of 


"175, 298, 330," change that to "164, 301, and 


348. High gain of minus 48 and 315." Over.

charged for a while longer, since we used up so 
much of it on the pad last night.

"Battery charge A," and you want to 


leave it on B. 


Yes. Right. Flip the page. Might as well clean 
up all of these checklist changes. At 19 hours 
40 minutes, change "Magazine Kilo Kilo" to "Mag

00 18 03 09 SC Oh! ... 
SC Yes. That was a good ... 
LMP Gordy, this is LMP. 
LMP Hello, Houston; 17. Are you reading? 
CC Go ahead, Jack. 
LMP Yes, you got any news today -to read up to us? 
CC Well, yes. As a matter of fact, we have a little 
bit made up here. I guess along the personal line, 
we checked with Barbara and Jan and the kids, and 
they're all back home safe and sound and they mentioned 
that they're going into their own personal 
quarantine period, glued to the squawk box. Over. 
CDR Okay. 
CMP I was afraid you were going to get too personal 
there, for a minute. (Laughter) 
CC I'll run down a few quick summaries of this morning's 
news. Former President Harry Truman has 
rallied slightly, despite his weakened heart and 
labored breathing. His doctors report that their 
main worry is whether his heart is strong enough 
to withstand the strain, the physical strain of 
88 years. Despite the slight rally, Truman's condition 
is still considered critical. In Paris, 
Henry Kissinger met with Hanoi's Le Duc Tho for 
4 hours yesterday in planned secret talks. Paris 
newspapers report an imminent cease-fire, but 
neither Kissinger or Tho indicate that this is 
true. After the 4-hou_ talks, Kissinger shook 
hands; and ... -got a little typo error here -
but neither representative made any comment concerning 
their meeting. At Camp David, Maryland, 
President Nixon's press secretary, Ron L. Ziegler, 
said that Kissinger and Nixon are in close communication 
by cable concerning the secret peace 
talks. But Ziegler declined to provide more 


Tape 15/2 
information about progress in the talks. President 
Nixon selected Claude S. Brinegar, a California 
oil executive and a doctor of economics, to be 
Secretary of Transportation succeeding John A. 
Volpe. Volpe will become the U.S. ambassador to 
Italy. Here's one concerning last night's launch. 
Mrs. Spiro Agnew reportedly made a wish on a falling 
star just before the delayed launch of Apollo 17. 
Sitting beside her at the VIP viewing site was 
Barbara Cernan, who said that she was nervous when 
the lift-off was postponed. She added, "But A1 Bean 
was there with me. He said not to be concerned." 
Mrs. Cernan was accompanied by her daughter, Tracy, 
and her mother, Mrs. Jackie Ashley. Mrs. Ron Evans, 
who saw the launch with her children, Jamie and 
John, said that she was never worried because 
everybody knew what they were doing.

Go ahead, Jack. 


I mentioned to Bob yesterday how -when we moved 


away from the Earth -how fragile a piece of blue 
it looked to be, and that impression certainly 
grows the farther you get from it. I wish everybody 
could have a chance to get that impression. 
Things might go a little easier for us.

Okay, Gene, ... CMC FREE? 


(Singing) ... must be making the vector worse and 
worse instead of better. (Laughter) Well, it was 
on the substellar point that time except it was 
halfway through the Earth almost. Not really. 


Hey, Gordy, we haven't really had a clear and 
detailed description of what you or somebody else 
saw at the launch, in terms of the lighting around 
the countryside, the state of the flame, and how 
long the -exhaust was under the S-IC. Do you 
have anything to add to that? 


Well, I can give you my feelings, anyway. It was 


a spectacular sight, and no doubt about it. I'd 


say the level of illumination would have made it 


easy to -to read a newspaper or anything like 


that from my vantage point near the VAB. The 


the plume itself actually looked no larger or -or 


even any brighter, really, except in contrast, 


than it does on a day launch by comparison. But 


well, the effect, I guess, was about what I ex


pected just trying to extrapolate previous launches 


into a nighttime situation. The weather was very 


clear. That was one advantage gained by delaying 


the launch the 2 hours and 40 minutes that you did. 


By that time, there were very few clouds around at 


all. And we could see a brilliant flash there 


when the first stage cut off and the second stage 


ignited. And I lost you visually probably, oh, 


4 to 5 minutes into the second stage, as best I 


can remember. Part of the problem was the bright


ness of the plume during the first stage, it kind 


of burned a spot on my eye; and so then I was

map for a while, and I -I'm not sure where 
Little America was. I can't truthfully say I did 
it -get it. I'll keep looking at it. 


Okay. I -at any rate, it looks like there's a 
very well-developed front coming out of the northwestern 
portion of Antarctic ice shelf. And and 
it -let's see here. Well, stand by 1. 


Roger. 


Have to change windows. 


Okay, Bob. That front looks like it starts and 
develops as a small -it -it actually seems to 
start with an anticyclone development off the 
coast of Antarctica. Moves up across New Zealand. 
Looks like the South Island primarily, a little 


bit of the North Island is still visible and into 


the eastern coast of Australia. And I'll give 
you a spot where it intersects and crosses the 
whole of Australia. However, it -it breaks up 
and is not very well formed, once it gets inland 
away from the coast. I see no well-developed 
waves on it at this time, so it's hard to say how 
strong it is. There might be one developing Just 
to the south of New Zealand or right off the coast 


of New Zealand.

discussion of the weather around Australia. That 
front does cross. Probably Brisbane is probably 
cloudy. It does cross about that area, and -however, 
there is a bank of clouds that runs off of 
it down the coastline. So Sidney is either cloudy 
or has some pretty nice clouds off -off shore. 
And the remnants of the front as it dissipates in 
the hinterland of Australia dies out at about the 
Great Sandy Desert, and there is not a good indication 
that it crosses into the Ind -Indian Ocean. 
But we're getting over 
little hard to tell.

CC Roger. 
LMP Now, it -more -looks more and more like the 
cyclone circulation developing right over the top 
of New Zealand; the South Island, I think. And 
now I'm looking with the binoc, and as much at 


Tape 16/4 
anticyclone circulation is centered on the ice 
shelf. And I think that -well, I Just don't 
know. I think that's the Ross Ice Shelf, but I'm 
not sure, off Antarctic. And the clouds from that 
circulation do extend over the ice shelf and barely 
into the Antarctic con -continent. 
CC Roger, Jack. 
00 20 13 46 LMP Now to the north of Antarctica. Let's see now. 
I ought to give you a better orientation than that. 
But, anyway, there is a large cyclone circulation 
pattern that has its southern extremity right on 
the edge of the ice shelf. And that -that is 
east by 20 or 30 degrees of longitude of the front 
that I just was discussing. By the way, that front 
intersects Antarctica. 
CC Roger, Jack. 
00 20 16 21 LMP Between New Zealand and Australia, the front I was 
discussing previously has some fairly strong transverse 
cloud patterns. It's hard to say whether 
they're high cirrus or not. But the clear area to 
the south of the front suggests that maybe the jet 
stream is roughly paralleling that front in that 
area. 
CC Roger. I'd have to look up and see --

LMP I -if I had to guess, if you were flying -west 
from Sidney this afternoon, you'd have a pretty 
strong tailwind behind you, Bob. 
CC Roger. 
LMP Let's see, did I get that right? 
LMP Would you believe a headwind? 
CC Okay. I'll believe that. 


Tape 16/5 
LMP But the bulk of Australia is very clear, all the 
south and the north. It's just that one line of -
of clouds that crosses the center section. 
CC Roger. 
00 20 18 45 LMP That put all the major cities of the south, Perth 
and Adelaide, at least, and Melbourne, certainly 
in the clear. And in the North Darwin, in those 
areas, are very nicely clear today. 
CC Roger. I hope we can get this out to them and 
let them know that you're watching and tell them 
how good the weather is. 
LMP Oh, that's all right. I'm just having fun, Bob. 
CC Understand. I imagine they'd appreciate it though. 
00 20 34 06 I24P Bob, I tried to pick out the Hawaiian Islands on 
that last little turn here through window 5. And 
I can't say that I did. I think I've got them -
the area spotted. It looks like they might be 
under some fairly heavy cloud cover today. I do 
not see the islands. I'm not sure I could, if it 
was clear. 
CC Roger. Hey, Jack, I got some answers to your 
question from last night on where Little America 
is with respect to -on Antarctica. 
LMP Go ahead. 
CC There's a inden 
-indentation that looks like a 
gulf that's called the Ross Sea, and on the northwest 
edge of the Ross Sea is Little America. That's 
the location of it. 
LMP Okay. And that would be the coast of Antarctica 
that sort of faces New Zealand and Australia. Is 
that correct? 
CC Negative. According to the map I've got, it's -
the Ross Sea looks like it would be more facing up 
towards the South America area. It's actually kind

Okay, Bob. You cut out, and I presume you meant 
that -the Ross Sea was facing north -sort of 
the Pacific between South America and Australia? 


That's affirmative, Jack; It's a very sharp indentation 
or sea or gulf onto the Antarctic. 


Okay. Ithink I know the area you mean, and I'll 
check it out again when it comes by. 


Okay. That's Little America on that west-northwest 
edge of that Ross Sea. That's where Little America 


is. 


Yes, all that -those names are familiar. I just 
had forgotten my geography. I'll see if I can 
recognize them. 


Okay, Bob, checking on the Ross Sea, and if I've 
got her pegged right, it's got a fair amount of 
open water in it this time of year. 

Roger. 


Although it's completely surrounded, I think, 


completely surrounded, I think by portions of the 


icepack. And off to the west of there, it looks 


like there's an area that might be -clear of 


snow, and -does my memory serve me correctly, 


that that's where McMurdo Sound is, and some of 
the dry valleys? 


I believe so. That's the Little America area 
right now, all that general vicinity, Jack. 


Okay. It looks like the prime recovery area and 


the Samoa Island region is clear, and my guess 
would be from the fairly subdued zero phase point, 


that they might have fairly nice seas out there. 


The boys on the Ticonderoga are probably enjoying 


themselves immensely, I hope.

the possible exception of the region over just 
north of Australia. New Guinea and that area

they are high or low clouds though. They look like 
they're probably fairly high clouds. But north of 
New Guinea, there's a strong concentration of

there might be a little tropical depression in that 
area.

CC Roger, Jack. Say, you might want to put something 
in the back of your mind here a minute. We made a 
run of the DSE recording just now of the TLI to 
get an idea of the quality of the DSE recording, 
and Gene came through loud and clear. Ron was 
very weak and almost unreadable, and we never 
caught you, Jack, in there. We don't -maybe you 
weren't saying anything during TLI, but we never 
did catch anything you said. 
LMP Okay. I don't recall talking too much during TLI. 
CC Roger. Understand. Now Gene -Gene came through 
real loud and clear. So whatever technique he 
was using went on that tape real well. 
00 20 55 48 CC Hey, Jack; Houston. 
LMP Hello. 
CC Hey, Jack. Just a couple more comments on that 
DSE. I think, as you well know, it's very critical 
on the position of your -of your boom there, and 
those areas that you're critical in, why, make sure 
that you've -you've really got those beauties up 
or you're talking right in -right into it. And 


Tape 16/8 
this -this really makes a difference, because 
the DSE -The volume is -is fairly low, and if 
you're muddled just the least bit, why, it -it's 
going to be difficult to pick it up. So talk 
slow, and -and get right up next to the mike, 
because I know you -you're doing it. Just some 
voices come across a little better than others. 
LMP Roger, Stu. Thanks for the comments. As a matter 
of fact, you probably called it Just right. I 
think during -once I got the helmet off, I lossened 
up my chinstrap, and my mike booms had moved away 
from my mouth some. And I'll keep that in mind. 
Thanks for the reminder.

item is that -is the position of those, and this 
has been true of -in the past, and it just really 
makes a difference in -in that -being able to 
pick up the data off the voice.

aware of that, but I think the fact that the volume

it, as much time as we've all spent down at the

just a couple more words about Australia. As a -
as a general landmass, it's red. Very strong red 
hues, except for the north and eastern coasts, 
where that red gradually merges into a greenish-
gray. It's as -as red as portions of -of northern 
Africa appeared to be yesterday. 
CC Roger. 
LMP Very striking color. It would be more of an orange-
red, really, with brown subduing it. It's not -
obviously not crimson or anything like that. 
CC You think it's a function of Sun angle, Jack, or 
is it just -just a red like we see out in New 
Mexico area sometimes -some of the areas? 
L_ Yes. No, it's not Sun angle, because that'll hold 
a good red color right -right in towards sunset 
or sunrise. It's -it's due primarily, I'm sure, 
like most desert areas, to the oxidation of the 
iron-bearing minerals in the sands and rocks in 
those regions. 
CC Roger. 
LMP Getting limonite and hematite. Little geology 
thrown in there, Bob. Sorry.

Hey, Bob. We -I think we've pretty well got 
impressions from you do_a there on that -on that 
night launch. I might give you a few of mine. 


Go ahead, Gene. 


17, Houston. Are you there? You're right on the 
edge, if you read me. We're getting a lot -You're 
right on the edge, if you read me. We're getting 
a lot of static. If you'll just hang on a minute, 


we'll be back into some calm air. 


Gene, Houston. Go ahead. 


17, Houston. 


Go ahead. 


We're just standing by for your comments you 
wanted to make. I think we lost comm there a 
minute. We're back with you. 


0kay_ Bob. The entire boost itself was not unlike 
what you've heard and what Stu down there under


stands from the physical cues, and what have you. 
But the significant part of going at night is that 
as soon as we did have ignition down there in the 
bottom of the S-IC stack -even though I only have 
a little slit out of -oat of the rendezvous win


dow here, and Ron doesn't have much of a hole in 
the boost protective cover out of the hatch window, 
we could definitely confirm ignition because we 
could see the reflected light on out through in 
front of us. It was by no means blinding, of 
course; we had the cockpit pretty well lit up. 
We -as soon as we lifted off, that light immediately 
went behind us We came into just S-IC 
staging, and I had an opportunity to say, "I told 


you so," to Jack and Ron. It was just like the 


great train wrecks of the past. I definitely 


could see the S-II ignite; and, then, of course, 


the -I could see the significance of the reflection 
through the window, besides all the other 


cues we had for ignition, very much like the S-IC 


lit up the windows on the stack. Tower jett was 


pretty spectacular. I could see -the entire boost 


protective cover and some flames from somewhere 


I'm not sure -maybe it was through the hole in 



Tape 17/3 
the windows -but I could definitely see it. Of 
course, it disappeared in short order. When the 
S-II shut down, the delay time between shutdown 
there and the S-IVB igniting, the entire -the 
entire flame overtook us, and we literally through -
flew through the S-II flame when the S-IVB ignited, 
if you can imagine that. It's very similar to the 
Titan staging, where you actually fly through the 
fireball on the S-II. And that's something you 
never see -none of those things you ever see quite 
that way in daylight. On the S-IV, I could see -
Of course, once we got going, I couldn't see _y 
light from that plume again, but we could see the 
APS firing all the way through the burn. And once 
we got in orbit, as other guys have seen, you 
could see the APS firing at night without any difficulty. 
One of the most significant things about 
TLI is the fact that we, of course, started at 
night and flew right on up and through a sunrise, 
which in itself was a pretty spectacular thing. 
But, when you do it during a TLI burn, it even 
adds a little bit of momentum to your effort. 
00 21 18 25 CC Roger, Gene. Any comment you might make on the 
possibility of picking up your yaw, if you'd lost 
your platform at that time -remember the discussion 
we had about the yaw in the late -like a 
Mode IV or something like that? 
CDR Yes, Bob. I not only will comment -I was aware 
of it, and I was looking for it. And during parts 
of the S-II and parts of the S-IVB burn, I even 
turned the lights down in the cockpit -in hopes 
that I could see stars out there; but I could not 
make out a one. Ron, I think, may have saw Saturn 
out the overhead hatch; but looking through the 
rendezvous window, during a boost phase and during 
a time-critical phase like a Mode II or Mode IV, 
I am very much afraid that we would not have been 
able to pick up that reference. 
CC Roger. 
CDR As I remember it, as low as I had the interior 
lights there for a period of time -and I didn't 
want to keep them that low, of course -to see 
if I could get adapted very fast because we were

in a dynamic phase of the burn. But my window just 
gave me a very deep purplish hue, a hue of which I 
could not, literally, see through to look to see 
any stars at all. Now, that may have been due to 
the very low intensity of our interior flood lights. 


Roger, Gene. 


Bob, this is Jack. A little lay impression there. 
I think I -saw just about everything Gene was 


talking about -as far as his description -and 


felt like it was -although everything was an 
amazing experience, each one in itself, after each 


one was over, you could think back and say, "Yes, 


that's what other guys said it was like." The old 
Saturn V has got to be a pretty consistently performing 
vehicle. But -with the added night-time 
contrast, I think it made it probably the best 
ride any three guys have ever had. 


Roger. 


Bob, I might add, that the S-I was, as usual, 
pretty shakey on lift-off. I saw all the maneuvers 
as I called them out -the yaw and small reverse 
roll. Going through max q, I got up to 
25 percent; but my yaw attitude error was zero and 
my pitch attitude error probably wasn't even at oh, 
certainly less than 2 degrees. After max q, 
she smoothed out by comparison quite a bit; and 
the S-II was a very quiet ride, a very smooth ride. 
However, you are always aware, due to just a little 
rumbling out in the S-IVB, that she was still burn


ing for you. The S-IVB, I think, was just a continually 
-rumble but smooth or consistent ride, 
all the way through TLI. 

Roger. 


Gee! I think one of the big things that impressed 


me was the -how instantaneous the decelerations 
were of each one of the boosters when they cut off. 


That included the S-IV TLI cut-off. No physical 


appreciation of tailoff at all. 


And, Bob, from my rendez -from the right-hand 


rendezvous window when the tower jett occurred, 
there seemed to be a lot of burning particles

streaming away from it. I could not see -did not 


notice or remember seeing the actual cover or tower 


itself; but I -we were inside the cone of the burn 


and with a lot of streaming. It looked very much 


like a sky rocket -portion of one at any rate. 


Reminded me of the Fourth of July out in Silver 


City a few years ago. 


Roger. Say, any time you got your Flight Plan 
handy, I've got a discussion here I'd like to run 
through with you on the -how we're going to re


cover those 2 hours and 40 minutes from the launch 


delay -and you'll need to copy it into the Flight 
Plan. And then just wanted -want you to be advised, 
we're not happy with the PTC. We get a half 
angle of about 17 degrees; and so sometime after the 
P52 coming up at 23:00, we'll want to do another 
PTC, or initiate PTC again. 


Well, that was the commander who initiated PTC, 
and I've already heard about that. 


(Laughter) You bet he has. Okay. We've got the 
Flight Plan here, Bob. Which part of it are you 
talking about ...? 


Well, let's just talk some words here for a minute, 
and then I'll go through some specifics that you 
can just write down on a page because you don't 
want to do it until a little later. Okay, what 
we're going to set up here -You will arrive at 
lunar orbit at the same GMT time. _le landing 
Sun angle -Sun elevation angle -and the camera 
settings and everything will be unchanged when you 
get to lunar orbit. To compensate for the 2 hour 
40 minute late launch, we're going to hack 2 hours 


and 40 minutes out of the timeline. And we're 


going to -They'll be out of the TLC timeline -and 
we're going to do it in two groups. And this is 
where you might want to start copying now, Ron. 
Delete 1 hour from 46 to 47. From 46 to 47, we're 
just going to delete the activities that are presently 
scheduled at 46:30 to 47:00, you'll perform 
at 45 -move those to 45. Let me read that again. 
Delete 1 hour from 46:00 to 47:00. The activit]_s

47 hours. And then the activities that are at 


46:30, we'll 
do those at 45:00. 


Roger, Ron.

just scratch 1 hour off of each time, just subtract 
1 hour from each of those times up through 66 hours. 
Just subtract 1 hour from 47 up through 66. 


Okay, we can do that. Subtract 1 hour from 47 
through 66 hours. 


Okay. And then just for your information -you 
won't have to do it -but we're going to play the 
old simulator step-ahead game at 66 hours of the 
old time, which will be 65 hours of the new time. 
So however you want to call it, we'll call you; 
and we're going to sync you up at 67:40 at that 
point. We'll play the old step-ahead game there. 


Okay, Bob. That means that you're not going to 


actually do any clock updates or syncs until 


until somewhere in the 60's there and not in 


the 40's. 


Roger. It'll be 65 hours of the new time or 
66 hours under the old time; depends on how you 
want to look at it. But that's when we'll sync 
you up. 

Okay. 


You'll be in sync all the way out to that time; 
just -we're just going to delete and jump you 
to 67:40. 


Okay. 


And just another note of interest -You don't have 
to write this down -what -let's see; I'll read 


it to you. The awake periods will be -on day 3, 
you'll be 15 hours, 8 hours sleep starting at

it is a good day because it gives us a chance to

generally go through all the things that have to 
be gone through for the rest of the mission. We've 
got 3 eating days today, and judging from what 
we're thinking and talking about now -that the last 
two are going to he sort of stretched into one 
eating period because three meals on this particular 
day Just is not really going to be stomachable.

up to 90 with just isometrics -pushing against 


the couch, and the running is obviously what it 


takes.

LMP Oh, lucky guess. I might say that the sub -the 
zero phase point that we're looking at is right at 
the northeast coast of Australia, and it's much 
brighter. Very -it's a very bright point now -
oh, it's hard to say how far across. But, quite 
unlike what I mentioned being in the vicinity of 
the Samoan Islands earlier. And it's right at the 
shore, and it could be just that the shore area 
has somewhat choppier seas. So maybe -maybe the 
brightness of that point is a function of sea state, 
although I don't know exactly what type of seas it 
would take to brighten it up. I suspect choppy 
seas are better than long swells.

Okay, I was going to try to recover there from that 


last few statements. As I recall, the weather 
briefings that we had at the Cape last week, that talking 
with Ken Nabor and Jim Nicholson do_n there, 
that the patterns we were seeing from the satellite 
pictures in their forecast -or analysis anyway, 


charts in the 
New Zealand part of the Pacific, 


those waves formed along the front would move north 
and then curve east. And that appears to be the 
pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. 


And I suspect if that pattern would hold with the 
wave that's developed off the coast -right on the 


coast of New Zealand now, that it might move on up 
the western coast of New Zealand. We'll probably 
have a chance to watch that the next few days and 


see what happens to it. 


Roger, Jack. 


Houston, how 
are you reading now? 


Reading you loud and clear. 


Okay, Bob. As I look at the clock, we're -just 


24 hours ago we were about within our hold somewhere. 
For this period yesterday we were in our 
hold, and I think it goes without saying; but we'd 


sure like to 
pass on our bit of gratitude and 


thanks for the response that the people down at 
the Cape came up with. And particularly at 


Marshall. I think we all knew no one would be 


going anywhere unless everyone was satisfied that 


we were going all the way. And that's certainly 


the way we felt, bet we do want to thank everybody 
who had a part in making that come true. 


Roger, Gene. I think it was a superb show between 


the Cape and Marshall and Houston and probably even 


Goddard, with the Network and Just about everybody 
concerned, really, had to do some work there 


to bring it off. And it went off real smoothly. 


Yes. After flying with Stafford a couple of times

are -reflect the various cold fronts have are

Okay. We're -we're jmst getting a little ahead we 
-took us longer last night on the presleep 
than we expected. We're trying to work it out 
again. 


Yes. We don't to -we want to terminate the waste 
stowage vent at that time, because we think that 
that vent is what's contributing to our PTC coning. 


Okay. We're -we're not -we're not really ready 
to go to sleep yet, but we're Just moving ahead. 


Roger. 


And if it's okay, I'll cycle the H2 fans. 


Roger. We're standing by. 


Okay. The fans are off. 


Roger. 

Say, Jack, we got a request in here from our ARIA 
friends. 


Go ahead. 

They were Just wondering if your looking out that 
way_ if you could give them some sort of update 
of what the weather in the Wake Island -Kwajalein 


the south of the Wake area looks like. 

Okay. Let me work on that one. 


Okay. You're going to mearn -earn your American 
Meteorological Society badge here pretty quick. 


Okay. Let me get the monocular, and we'll look 


at Wake Island. I miss having all those nice 


latitude and longitude lines on the globe.

... there. 


Okay, Bob. I'll probably have to work on this 
one a little more, but -but it looks like around 
Wake, or in the vicinity of the Kwajaleins and 
north of Wake, about all you have is a lot of 
cloudiness although -and in a generally -over 
wide part of that Pacific, I'm talking about 15 
or 20 degrees of longitude and latitude, there's 
a -roughly a clock -a clockwise circulation 
pattern. But the clouds do not look very dense 
or concentrated in any one area. And at leading 
off to the southeast from that general cloud mass, 
there're cyclonic -anticyclonic cloud mass is 


a -is one of the old fronts -or at least one of 


the old linear cloud patterns that extends down 
into the South Pacific. 


Roger, Jack. I'm sure that the ARIA troops are 
listening down at Patrick and caught all that. 


Well, my guess is, Bob, and it's purely a guess, 
is that there -probably -if they were out there 
right now, would be experiencing an intermediate 
layer of clouds with scattered showers. And a 
not too strongly developed circulation system, so 
I can't predict the winds. But I wouldn't expect 
them to be anything -anything what might be 
down -associated with the remnants of the tropical 
depression Theresa. Now that Theresa -what's 
left of it, if I'm correct in -in picking it out 
there, probably is -is moving in that direction, 
although it looks weak enough. But right now I 
don't think it would be any big problem. And it 
may, in fact, go south of there. 


Roger. The prog I got in my hand for 3-hour-old 
weather has Theresa located just about in the 
Manila area. Did you concur with that, or do you 


think it passed the -the Philippines? 


Well, I don't -Manila's clear. The only thing 


approaching near Manila is -is this other storm 
center that now is north of Borneo. And to the 


east of Manila, it's clear all the way over to 
this little cloud mass that I was guess might be 
Theresa.

I noticed was that our zero phase point is not 
nearly as bright on the west coast of Australia as 
it is on the -was on the east. And it's looking 
right at the coastline now and see no bright spot 
in the center. Also, that circulation pattern or 
tropical depression possibly that I saw earlier 
north of Borneo is now even more strongly developed 
at the tail end of the front that stretches up 
toward Japan. And it -it really looks like a 
humdinger from here. Beautiful circulation pattern 
and very concentrated. And it is now east of 
Vietnam, and again between Vietnam and -and the 
island of Luzon.

I think I acclimated. And I really feel good. 
I've been eating a lot better, and I'm not -the 
only thing I ever really felt was a slight headache. 
It really -not the fullness of the head that 
people described, I guess, but Just a little headache.

much. I don't know.

Okay. I'll get to that in a minute, Bob. Who 


knows, I might have something else to say. 


Okay. (Laughter) 


Bob, I Just probably ought to qualify, all those 


remarks about the Earth's weather. It's purely 


novice talking about something he is very un


familiar with, except for having a longstanding 


interest in it. And I think the one philosophical 


point, if any, that comes out of it is that some


body, probably 3-1/2 billion years ago or so, 


could have looked at the Earth and described 


patterns not 
too dissimilar. And it was within 


those patterns that life developed, and now you 


see, I think, and obvious to everybody, what that 


life has progressed to doing. And I certainly 


think all of us feel that it has not stopped doing 


that progression, and we'll probably see it do 
things that even you and I can't imagine them doing. 


I certainly hope so.

terms that might -might transmit at least a part 
of that feeling to everybody in the world. Unfortunately, 
that's not the case. But he certainly 
couldn't look at that fragile blue globe and not 
think about the ancient sails of life that are 
crossing its paths and wonder ahead to the -up 
to the present, to the modern sails of life that 
are represented by men that developed out of that 
life that are sitting there next to you and that 
are the country in all sorts of different guises

put that life farther into the universe. I certainly

except for an area probably around Zambia and 
Rhodesia in the tropical convergence zone there, 
where it looks pretty cloudy and probably quite 
rainy. There's a very strong circulation pattern 
and presumably a storm off -Just off the coast of 
northwest Africa. Very spectacular spiral formation 
of clouds in a cyclone development. It looks 
like there are probably two fairly weak cyclones -
Southern Hemisphere cyclones in the South Atlantic. 
One, southwest of Cape of Good Hope, and the other 
about due west of -of the Falkland Islands, maybe 
a little bit north of that. South America looks 
to be in quite good shape weatherwise, except possibly 
Uruguay and maybe northern Argentina which 
appear to have a -at least some fairly thick 
clouds there, although no strong circtulation associated 
with this .... 
01 09 48 01 CC Okay, Jack. We got all that up to Argentina, 
the omni switch kind of cut you off. 
then 
CC Jack, we got the -at least the f_rst part of your 
weather report fine up through the clouds in 
northern Argentina_ and then the switch in o_is 
cut you out. 
LMP Okay, that was about it, Gordy. That's -i'll 
talk to you some more later about it. I guess the 
main thing I need now is -are your consumables. 
CC Okay. By the way, you were looking back from more 
than halfway to the Moon. You're about 125,000 
out now. On the consumables, the RCS is running 
at 1.3 percent over the Flight Plan line. On the 
02: tanks 2 and 3 are right on the line, and 
tank 1 is about 4 percent below the line. But it's 
been there all the way since launch, that same bias 
on tank 1. On the hydrogen: tanks 1 and 3 are 
right on the line, tank 2 is about 3 percent above 
the line, Ail in all, you're looking real good 
consumablewise. 
LMP Okay. That's hardly worth writing down, i guess. 


Tape 25/5 
CMP That's the way we like to see it. 
CC Same here. The only other thing I have in the way 
of updates is a PIPA bias update. You can load it 
yourself, or we can load it when we come up with 
the up-link prior to the burn. Your choice. And 
then we'll have an update to the erasable load 
update and a supplement to correspond with that 
bias update. 
CDR Gordy, why don't you go ahead 
when you send up the vector? 
and load it yourself 
CC Okay, and I'll give you that update for the supplement. 
It's on 1-43 whenever you're -whenever 
it's convenient.

17, Houston. I have a little synopsis of the news 
here, if you'd like to listen during breakfast. 
Let me know. 


Okay, mighty fine. Send it up. 


Okay, front page first. In Paris, Henry Kissinger 
met for 30 minutes this morning with French President 
George Pompidou at the E_Tseg Palace just 
hours before his scheduled conference with North 
Vietnamese Politburo member Le Due Tho -_o, that 
is. North Vietnamese spokesmen accused Eissinger 
of attempting to force a peace settlement by 
threatening further escalation of the war. As both 


U.S. and North Vietnamese negotiators expressed 
disappointment at the continued deadlock, Chief 
American delegate William J. Porter traveled to 
Brussels to brief Secretary of State William B. 
Rogers. Rogers will -will return later today 
from the NATO Conference of Ministers. This one 
is datel -date -datelined Brussels. Diplomatic 


sources indicated today that NATO allies will request 
negotiations with the Soviet Union and its 
allies on mutual troop reductions in central Europe. 
Exploratory talks expected to begin about January 
31, with full-scale negotiations to follow 
sometime next fall. In Kansas City, vital life 
signs for Harry S. Truman appear to have stabilized. 


But the 88-year-old former President remains on the 


critical list at Kansas City's Research Hospital. 
Truman is suffering from lung congestion and heart 


weakness. In Argentina, aides to popular Argentine 
politician Juan Peron said that Peron will refuse 
the nomination to the presidency of Argentina and 
will return to exile during the coming week. And, 
on the sports page, Rice coach A1 Conover is expected 
to reveal today -sometime today his decision 
to either remain at Rice as head coach or move 
to his alma mater Wake Forest in a similar position. 
The Owl head coach has said that he has been offered 
the job and promises a yes-or-no decision today.

Go ahead. You're loud and clear. 


Okay, Gordy, going from south to north on noontime, 
at least our noontime weather, it looks like 
there is a fairly strong mass of polar air moving 
from the southwest up towards Tierra del Fuego. 


It's mixed with some cloudiness that extends from 


that area all the way down to the Antarctic ice 
shelf. But it looks like some pretty good movement 
patterns from the southwest, north -northeast. 
No strong weather waves or cyclone 
development on that yet, although one may be picking 
up about halfway between Tierra del Fuego and the 
coast of Antarctica, the -where the front, or at 
least the cloud masses, curve from the east-west 


direction to an almost due south direction. Most 


of South America still looks like pretty good 
weather. There is cloudiness along the Andean 
Ridge and also in the Amazon Basin, stretching 
from the eastern coast of South America on up 


about, oh, two-thirds of the way towards Central 


America. It doesn't look like frontal weather 


there. It's probably tropical convergence weather. 
Now there is this -still this small, moderately

the Midwest to the East Coast. And, also, there's 
no good indication of stratification of those 
clouds, as if they'd be fairly -fairly thick up 
into the cirrus levels.

Gordy, there is one minor weather disturbance, possibly 
just about over Puerto Rico or maybe Just just 
to the east of that island. No strong circulation 
patterns, although there's a hint of a 
cyclone development. There might be just a small 
depression in that area. I don't know whether 
your maps are carrying anything down there or not. 


I think I see what you're talking about on the 
satellite picture, but I don't have a surface analysis 
that goes that far. I do -I just now got a 
copy of the surface charts for the United States. 
And there's -there's a front stretching from 
northern Texas northeastward up through Tennessee 
and Virginia and another one sort of parallel to 


it. But, this ... southward from Louisiana along 


the Gulf Coast across northern Florida and on out 


into the Atlantic. And I guess the two are kind 


of blending together to make that irregular mass 


of clouds you mentioned. 


Okay, Gordy. If I'd been a little more observant 
I could see that there was a little bit, looks like 
a decrease in at least the thickness of the clouds, 
vertical thickness, between the two areas you Just 
mentioned. So, there is some indication here of 


those two fronts, although they are contributing 
to a general weather pattern in the eastern United 
States. 

Roger. 


I think, with a little experience in this business, 
you might have picked those two out of that mass. 
But it's not _m_ediately obvious. 


Roger. 


You got anything on there coming in from the northwest 
now, say up in Wyoming and Colorado? 


The way it's drawn on this surface charts shows 
that -that northern front that I mentioned, just 
now, sort of curving on up through central Colorado, 
and then bending westward toward -through Utah. 
That's about the only other frontal activity. There's 
one, probably dry front, then a short one through 


central Arizona and southern Utah. 



Tape 28/5 
LMP Okay. Well, that makes sense. That would match 
with that -what I was thinking was high cirrus 
in Arizona. And also I can see how you could 
bend -that's the northern front up through Colorado 
and then back westward to explain the patterns 
we're seeing in the clear areas south of 
that. 
CC Roger. 
O1 14 33 04 LMP Gordy, the zero-phase point now is off the coast 
of Chile and Ecuador -oh, maybe 10 or 15 degrees 
of longitude, and it is fairly dull. It does not 
seem to indicate any great amount of choppiness 
or wave action in that area.

LMP Okay, Ron. We copy that. 
O1 14 34 55 LMP Gordy, with respect to the icepack off the coast 
of Antarctica, it's difficult to distinguish pack 
ice from clouds, in general. However, the clouds 
seem to pick up reflection patterns with respect 
to the Sun. And using that as a -and some shadows 
in below as the criteria, it looks as if the pack 
ice in the South Atlantic would extend to a latitude 
almost comparable to that of Tierra del Fuego. I

CC Okay.

I don't either. But maybe someone who's

LMP Now to the southwest of Tierra del Fuego there's 
a -looks like a small cyclone developing, clockwise 
rotation, just off the edge of the pack ice, 


Tapea8/6 
and -but it does not seem to be closely associated 
with the frontal activity that I mentioned 
when I started out speaking at this -this particular 
time. 
CC Roger. 
01 14 36 36 LMP There is another -there is another one, maybe a 
front, a little bit ahead of that cyclone that's 
now extending north-south. Starts in the pack ice 
area and extends up -oh, about halfway from there 
to Buenos Aires -in the directiom of Buenos Aires. 
It doesn't look like a very major mass of air or 
frontal system. It may develop into something 
over the next couple days though. 
CC Okay. 
01 14 38 08 LMP And centered, Gordy, at about 45 south and say

I gave you earlier, down in that area, are -also 
bend around that axis. 


Okay. 


And there just, oh, there are probably a dozen, 
if you tried to pull them out, cloud bands between 
the Ross Sea and Tierra del Fuego that bend around 
the same axis. Quite striking. 


Roger. 


Now there's some indications, to me at any rate, 
that the jetstream in that area may be essentially 
east-west -oh, maybe 20 degrees of latitude north 
of the Ross Sea, and then bends down very sharply 
so that it intersects the -or approaches the coa Antarctic 
ice shelf to the east of the Ross Sea, 
and then maybe it bends up and forms the axis that 
I just described that's causing that bending of 
the cloud patterns. 


Okay. Solmds like a good theory. 


There's a linear clear area in that area north of 


the Ross Sea that -and to the north of that is a 


sharply defined front that I talked about earlier. 


And then, both the -that front continues. The 


clear area is cut off by the axis that I described, 


a cloud axis.

Yes; we're on, Gordo. Go ahead. 


Okay. Geno_ you mentioned taking a nausea pill for 


some gas yesterday, and we were looking into some 


of the side effects. You definitely don't want to 


use that particular pill for gas. One of the side 


effects is that it's an appetite depressor. And 


there are some pills loaded in A-7, along with the 


vitamin pills, specifically for the purpose of 


eliminating gas. We would appreciate if you'd give 


us a call in advance prior to taking any medications 


except the Seconal and aspirin. Over.

depressors were around. At the time, we couldn't 
find them in A-7. And so I took one of those other 
things, whatever it is. And while you're talking 
about that, as per the preflight food check, gas 
is very evident on -particularly on me -and I

01 17 42 26 LMP Okay, Gordy. Let me say once again, way back when 
we first started and Gene was talking to you, I 
heard one of your answers, weak but clear, with 
zero signal strength showing here. Now, that 
might have been through Ron's VOX, I don't know. 
Since then, you've been able to modulate the signal 
strength, with occasional weak words. And -and 
then, when that signal strength was up around 3.2, 
where it is now, then you came in loud and clear 
with a broadcast. I answered you, you said about 
three words, then dropped off completely. And 
then we -we changed configuration.

here in the way of signal strengths dropping in

peaches, cinnamon toast, orange Juice, and cocoa 
for breakfast. That's how he keeps his form. And, 


for lunch, he had a peanut butter sandwich and

to try to get in the second baffle, anyhow. So, 
I'm going to take another turn of Krytox and put 
some more in there.

over the place if I do that, but I'll try it. 


Roger. Very slowly. 


(Laughter ) Righ t. 


Ron, Just a question while you're watching it 
here. Do you have any bubbles in the lineal cell? 


Yes. This one is going to be interesting. There 


are about, oh, a dozen, nine to a dozen -sma]] 
bubbles right next to the inject board and then 
about the same number right in the center of the 


convex portion of it. 


Roger, Ron. Did you -we didn't copy your answer 
to our question about any bubbles in the lineal. 


No, I didn't get to your question on that. In 
the lineal unit there are no bubbles whatsoever. 


Roger. Thank you. 


And there might have been very slight movement. 
Matter of fact, I can see just a very slight move


ment_ even now. The particles, in there, they're 


still lined up in the YY direction essentially 


though, although it looks like some of them may 


have deviated from the front of the lineal unit

about the orientation. We missed some comment 


about the frame numbers; I think came from Jack. 


Okay. Something's a little different on this onc_

looks just like a finger, it's a curved surface 
that goes out and almost touches the -the circumference 
of the dish. And it looks just like 
if you're holding your finger up and looking at 
it. It's that type of a shape to it. It comes 
back down, and it's about a half an inch wide.

to the first cocked position. And that's 
the way it is right now. 


Okay, Ron. 


Okay. One piece of tape coming up shortly, provided 
I can find the tape. Here it is. Okay, 


Gordo, I'm running up through the tunnel from 
America to Challenger. 


Roger. 


Piece of tape coming up. I'll tell you, Gordo, 


it's remarkably clean up here. It doesn't look 


like the snowstorm that I remember coming into 


last time. 


Roger. Understand° 


... up here. Hey, you did a good job, friend. 
Hey, that's good. Where is it? Oh, you ... 
straight out there? Let me see; I want to see. 
I want to take a look at it, too. Hey, there it 
is; sticking straight out. Okay, Houston, America 
has a VHF antenna -looks deployed perfectly. 


Roger. 


... upside down in there .... The commander's 
window has a slight amount of condensation on the 


lower left edge -that's the left-hand edge, 
really. It seems to be just there when the Sun 
warms the window.

CC Roger, Jack. 
LMP Okay. I'm looking out the AOT, and I see a _tF 
antenna and part of a umbra radar antenna in position 
1. Position 2 looks right in the radar 
antenna, and, as I said yesterday, it was 
beautiful. 
CC Roger. 
LMP Position 3, I see the other side of America and 
very, very clean air, very clean. Okay, I got 
a good view of the side of the service module, 
and you can see these little blisters in the side 
of the covering there quite distinctly. I think 
people were talking about those before. 
CC Roger. 
_ Yes, I take that back. That's the side of -
that's the side of the command module we're looking 
at that has the little blisters on it. Got 
to get oriented up here. Got a great view of the

01 22 54 22 LMP i need to make a correction. Roger. I need to make 
a correction. It looks as if that storm area that 
was in New Zealand yesterday has moved up across 
the two islands and is now sitting northwest, it's 
getting a little hard to identify the sma] l(_r is]_lds 
in the pacific_ but -pretty sure l've got it in th_ 
right place now looking at the map. And it is 
northwest of New Zealand. And it looks like New 
Zealand is probably having reasonably good weather 
today, although I suspect it rained last night. 


Tape 33/17 
CC Roger, Jack. That's interest2ng because on _V prog 
it doesn't show a thing down that area. This just 
may not be up to date here yet. 
01 22 55 43 LMP Well, there may be nothing down there except some 
cloud patterns and -but that's all I can see, 
of course. The front that's south of Australia 
now -I presume front -just looking at a fairly 
well-developed, although narrow, cloud line, is 
about 5 -about 10 degrees south of Perth right 
now, southwest of Perth and runs on a northwest-
southeast line -over to a point about 10 or 
15 degrees southwest of Tasmania. And then it 
intersects a curved front that runs from there up 
to -to Tasmania, and then back around down south 
of New Zealand about 10 degrees. 
CC Roger, Jack. 
01 22 56 24 CDR Say, Bob, this is Gene. I got some new sensors on. 
You might want to take a look at them. 
CC Roger. Good show, Gene. We were just wondering 
about that, and I'll bug the guys on my left here 
and make sure they're looking at them. 
01 22 56 51 CC We're not getting any data yet, Gene. 
02 22 56 55 LMP Bob, we're starting to get ... from just off I,uzon 
on the northeast trend ... seen so far a shadow 
line of fairly thick high clouds overlying some 
thick lower clouds behind the front.

CC Well, I'm not sure because we picked up a number 
of different bits, and then we dropped it a21. 
LMP Did you get the overcast over Korea and Manchuria 
bit? 
CC Negative. I didn't get that. 


Tape 33/18 
01 22 59 36 LMP Okay. That generally -South China looks clear. 
I haven't had a real good look at it yet, it's out 
on the limb. It's clearly, however, overcast over 
Korea and Manchuria. It does not appear to be 
frontal weather there, though. The dominant front 
in the northwestern Pacific stretches on a northwest 
line from just off Luzen on up as far as I can 
see to the terminator. And it seems to be an 
extremely strong front with what I would guess is 
heavy air-mass weather all along it. And up to 
the east-northeast of Japan, there's an excellent 
example of a shadow line from some fairly thick 
high clouds on solid overcast of lower clouds. 
Don't see any major cyclone development alon_ _t_ 
or wave development. It just loeks like a very 
strong air-mass front. 
CC Roger, Jaak. We_ve got it on our prog here. Me 
don't show the one on the northeast part of Japan, 
but we do show a front prog for tomorrow morning 
going off of Taiwan and -right from Taiwan eastward 
-past the Ryuk_2u Islands and just on into 
the northern Pacific there. Looks like pretty 
heavy cloud mass over there.

you -as you see -I presume -I -the LHP no 
longer has sensors on. 
CC Roger. We confirm that. 
LM2 By the way, those were the -I guess you know -
the sensors that we put on at the Cape. And they 
still seemed to he in good shape when I took them 
off. I figured I'd let things rest a while, and 
then I'll put them on again tomorrow.

I think that you were the jinx on Gemini 9 for all 
the delays. Over. 
CDR No way; you got a longer history than I do. 
CC Everything's looking great. 
CDR Yes, it's looking good on hoard. We're -I think 
we're pretty well squared away. We've got our 
stowage in shape, and we're in the house-cleaning

Yes, we've been watching that one.

I'd love to invite you up here for supper.

01 23 27 37 CC 17, Houston. Just a couple words. We'd like you 
to know we're real satisfied with all the LM data 
that we saw during the LM activation work today. 
And, looking at it, the data looked real good. 
LMP Great, Bob. I was -you had me worried there for 
a while with the comm. Do you have a good idea 
what caused that? 
CC Yes, we're sure about 99.9 percent of it was Just 
ground linkup. 
LMP Yes, that's certainly the way it acted onboard. 
CC I guess there won't be any need to go back and 
change the Checklist on that, but there's a lot 
to be said for maybe going to a real good stable 
condition and then getting a good firm checkout 
before you go into that downvoice backup mode and 
things like that. And I think that's what we'll 
do in the future. 
01 23 28 35 LMP Understand. 
01 23 45 50 LMP Houston; 7 -17. 
CC Go ahead, Jack. 
LMP Say, I'm just a little curious about the difficulty 
on holding the omnis. Is that about the same as 
past missions, or are we losing a little bit more 
than usual? 
CC We're going to have Ed here give us a description 
for a minute, so let me stand by. 
LMP Okay. 
CC Jack, according to that -to our stalwart INC0 
over there, due to this new 210 down at Tidbinbilla 
we're holding actually longer than in the past 
history.

Okay. I just guess I've never been on this end 


before. 


Roger. Do you -do you hear it onboard when we 


break lock there? 


Yes, matter of fact, with our SQUELCH ENABLED, we 


lose all the background noise. And we know when 
we're picking you up because we start to get back


ground noise again. 


Roger. In other words, you -you are able to stop 
talking or something when you -when you know we're 
breaking lock then? 


Well, if we happen to be talking when you break 
lock -no, unless we're watching the meters we 
won't. We lose you when you get about 55 -say 


60 percent signal strength. And apparently we're 
not talking to you when we have less than that. 


Roger. Yes, INCO gave me a briefing tonight and 
showed me what chart to watch so I can look at 


numbers when to talk. I've been talking to myself 
too much, lately. 


Yes, they have a beautiful chart there for that 
purpose. 


I never really wanted to be an INC0, but I guess 
I was forced to tonight. 


There are lots of comments for that one, Bob; but 
I'd better not say anything. 


Roger. 


You'd never speak to me again. 


Well, that's all right. We can't X-rate the transcripts, 
so we'll just have to take -take it easy. 


Ssy, Bob, I've got another question about the 
Challenger. 


Go ahead, sir. 



Tape 34/3 
LMP (Music) Yes, sir. The battery voltage on low 
taps, strangely enough, was just like the simulator; 
but I had expected that the simulator 
might have been wrong -that we would have seen 
higher voltage there. Is that -is that about 
what you guys expected? 
CC Roger. They said they expected that because the 
extra time on the pad that they're running. That 
2-hour-and-40-minute delay is coming into play 
again. 
LMP Oh, yes_ yes. That's right. Good. I forgot all 
about that. Something made that slip my mind. 
CC Well, things have been going so well that I c_'t 
blame you forgetting that. 
LMP ... Stanley Holloway's crazy Flight Plan updates 
that we've just forgotten that we were ever late. 
CC Roger. Say, by the way, we like the music in the 
background. Sounds pretty good. 
LMP Yes, we sort of -didn't -we didn't get it out 
at all until today_ [Music: Whipped Cream by 
A1 Hirt] I don't know whether we forgot about it 
or too many other learning things going on. It's -
it's quite pleasant. 
CC Roger. I don't think you forgot about it. I 
think you were just glued to those windows. 
01 23 50 32 LMP Well, I still am, as a matter of fact. _e old 
Earth's coming by. And, say, I mentioned a couple 
of fronts that joined together about 20 degrees 
south of -of -the south coast of Australia. And 
it looks like that's a fairly healthy storm center 
developing down in there -conceivably may migrate 
up across Tasmania and maybe up -up the Sydney-
Brisbane coastal area in the next few days. 
CC Roger. Where is the exact center of that, Jack?

see, that's about 6 hours from now -shows it to 
be right over the Vietnam area, the Viet -Vietnam 
peninsula there. So it looks like it's moving 
the way they're progging it, huh?

Hello, Houston; 17. 


Go ahead. 


Roger. While we're getting organized to eat a 


little bit here, I'll give you your morning weather 
report, if you want it. 


Okay, go ahead. 


Okay, Gordy. That little storm -fairly big 
storm -that was off the coast of northwest Africa 


yesterday, has moved inland and presumably is 
giving those people up there some weather. Might 
even be getting some snow up in the Atlas Mountains. 


It's still fairly well organized and inland a few 
hundred miles -or the edge of it is inland a few 
hundred miles. The people at the Cape of Good Hope 


ought to be seeing some clouds that are forerunners 


of a large circulation system that's south-


southwest of them-that, although large, it seems 
to have most of its heavy clouds to the southeast 


of the center. And they may not get any major 
weather out of this one. But they'll probably 
have cloudiness for a few days. The storm that 
was over Buenos Aires yesterday has apparently 


moved out to 
sea and is now west -or east-


southeast of that area. Otherwise the -except 


for those three storm areas, the South Atlantic 


looks relatively calm. The zero phase point is 
now off the -east coast of South America, and it 


looks fairly 
dull and gray. And I suspect no ex


tensive choppiness in that area. 


Jack, take a breather there. We got an antenna 


switch coming. 


Okay Jack, we're back with you and listening. 


Okay, Gordy, I can't see you right now. I think 
that was about the extent of it. We'll get some 
food; and, while I'm eating, I'll look at it and 
see if there are any more details.

Okay. 


17, Houston. I have the morning news here, whenever 
you'd like to hear it -if you would. 


Go ahead, Gordo. We'd like to hear it now. 


Okay. First, a look at the weather in the local 
area. It's going to be mostly cloudy through 
Sunday, with a chance of showers here today -but 
much warmer. I'll have to wait until we get 
through the omni switch here, and then I'll be 
back with you. 


Okay, 17, continuing on with the weather. It 


should be -get up to the upper 60s here in Houston 


today. It was foggy when I came to work, but I 


understand the Sun is out now and the fog is burned 


off. On the international-national scene: There's 


another reported snag in negotiations between 


Dr. Henry Kissinger and North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho. 


The two have discussed the peace terms since Mon


day; but, so far, little news concerning the talks 


has been released by either side. They meet again 


today. A Judge in the Pentagon Papers trial of 


Daniel Ellsburg has declared a mistrial. Judge 


Matt Burn has asked that a new jury be selected. 


Both sides in the cases must now go back to the 


beginning and prepare their arguments again. 


Former President Harry Truman is still hospitalized 


with a serious heart condition. Although listed 


in critical condition, the 88-year-old former 


Chief Executive has shown some improvement, accord


ing to his daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel. 


President Nixon has completed selection of his new 


cabinet by announcing that he will keep Richard 


Kleindienst as Attorney General. There will be a 


number of major changes, though, in upper levels 


of the Justice and Interior Departments. Life 


Magazine will be no more as of the end of December. 


The pictorial magazine lost over 30 million dollars 


during the past 4 years. No doubt some of the 


final pictures to appear in the famous 36-year-old 


publication will be those of the Apollo 17 mission. 


An airliner crashed at Midway Airport in Chicago, 


Friday. Of the 61 persons aboard, only 18 survived

the crash. In other national and international 


highlights: Unemployment figures show a drop to 
the lowest level in 2 years; 5.6 billion dollars 


has been released by the Federal Government in 
the first revenue-sharing payment to the state 


and local governments; and the NATO foreign ministers 
have urged the Soviet Union to cut down 
troop strength and allow freer movement of people 


o_er the east-west borders. In local and regional 


news: New hijack control devices have been installed 
at Houston Intercontinental Airport. The 


new metal detectors are being installed in many air


ports around the United States. New inspection 
procedures will also begin in January -of all 
hand luggage carried aboard airliners. And on 


the sports page: A1 Conover is not going to return 
to Wake Forest as rumored. The Rice coach 


has met with University President Dr. Norman 


Haekermau to discuss a firm 5-year contract agree


ment. Professional football highlights today's 
sports; the "Over-the-Hill-Gang" from Washington 


with Billy Kilmer and Larry Brown will take on the 
Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium in Irving. The 
Cowboys will, no doubt, go with Craig Morton at 
quarterback. Dallas can ensure itself of a "wild 
card" slot in the playoffs with the Redskins, if 
they win. For Dallas, it's a revenge game. The 
Skins have won nine straight. 


CC Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds all-everything 
catcher, has been hospitalized for tests. X-rays 
showed a spot on a lung. Doctors feel sure the 
lesion is benign, though. The University of 
Houston basketball team takes on Xavier tonight. 
The Cougars, with four wins and one loss, will 
face a Xavier team that likes to play slowdown 


basketball. The Houston Rockets beat the Portland,

CDR Yes, sir, Gordy. Go ahead. 
CC Okay. It was a United Airlines jet, 61 people 
aboard. And it crashed into a south-side Chicago 
neighborhood while trying to land at Midway. Most 
of the 55 passengers -There were -well, I'm not 
sure I'm getting all the numbers right here. But 
it said here that most of the 55 passengers were 
found dead in the debris of a -and it was a 
Boeing 737 about a half a mile away from the airport. 
One of the victims was representative 
George Collins, a Democrat from Illinois -who was 
returning from Washington to organize a children's 
Christmas party. The weather, at the time, was a 
500-foot ceiling and 1-mile visibility. And sleet 
and snow were falling at the time. There were no 
report that any occupants of the houses were injured 
or killed. I turn back to the back of the 
paper, here. A United spokesman said one of the 


Tape 41/6 
six crewmembers, a stewardess, was among 16 persons 
aSm_tted to Holy Cross Hospital. She said there 
were two infants among the passengers. Jet apparently 
missed runway 13 at Midway on -and cruised 
over the neighborhood of bungalow homes at heights 
of 500 to 1000 feet and then with his nose up and 
tail down tore into the dwellings. Witnesses said 
the plane scraped the roofs of two bungalows and 
sheared through six houses, setting them aflame. 
The fuselage of the airliner split, but the nose 
remained intact. A tail section was sticking out 
of one house. The plm_mmetting airliner sheared 
through utility lines and a 2-square-mile area 
was blacked out. Telephone service was knocked 
out. A power company spokesman said 5000 homes 
were affected. 
CDR Okey doke. 
CC And a little news about your trajectory. Since 
the midcourse 2, you've been looking real good. 
You've -you're homing in on 53-1/2-mile parallel. 
We're discussing midcourse 4, which -if we do it 
all -it's going to be very small. It's looking 
like about a foot and a half per second right now. 
And I guess if we do it, it will only be because 
it will save us DELTA-V at LOI. Over. 
CDR Okay, I was just looking. Those dumps really 
knocked us for a loop, didn't they?

17, Houston. I have some words about the troubles 
we had during the LM comm checks yesterday, if 
you have a free moment to listen. 


Go ahead, Gordy. We're listening. 


Okay. We think we've got a pretty good handle on 
what the problem was -and that was, that the the 
LM communications gear, we think, was jumping 


on the voice 
subcarrier, rather than the main 


carrier. And the symptoms that we had point to 


that. What would happen is, when I would try to 


transmit, then it would lose lock as soon as I 


put modulation on the voice subcarrier. During 


the checks today, we're going to try to verify 


that the system is indeed working okay. And we 


can do it without any changes in the onboard pro


cedures by - 
purely by procedures that will be 


handled at the ground site and here at Mission 


Control. And so that's what we're planning to do. 


We really don't -The problem that happened has 


been seen before, evidently; and it's not that 


unusual. We 
really don't think there's anything 


wrong with the onboard equipment. Over. 


Sounds good, 
Gordy. We'll just take her slow and 


easy when I get over there today and make sure we 


understand it.

Okay, now that we got another look at you, Gordy, 
it looks like Houston might be right on the fringes 


of either being clear or clearer. The entire Gulf 


is pretty nice. Florida looks pretty clear, and 
Mexico looks pretty clear. There's a big air mass 


of clouds that looks like it picks up somewhere 


around the coast at Houston, heads on up north, and 


then covers most of the Midwest and the East 


from about the middle of Mississippi, Alabama, and 


Georgia on north. It's clear enough now to even 


see the coral reefs down off of Florida.

how you plan on handling this time update again? 
CC Okay. I'll do that. Let me -but let me practice

CDR Okay. I'm primarily interested in those parts of 
the Flight Plan which we're going to eliminate. 
02 14 55 16 CC Okay. Just one second. 
02 14 57 33 CC Geno, I'll read you the PAO release; they s,,mmed 
up pretty well, and I'll Just use their words here. 
The time has been made up in two increments. The 
first one of i hour and 45 minutes in the Flight 
Plan. The crew activities were Jumped ahead by 
i hour, and they essentially began doing those 
things that were called for i hour later in the 
Flight Plan. They will again Jump ahead an hour 
and 40 minutes, and that will occur at 65 hours. 
By that time they will have completed all those 
activities required up through 67 hours and 40 minutes 
in the Flight Plan. Or, in other words, they 
will have completed all the activities required to 
get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes

early, and in order to make the clocks then agree 
withwhere the crew will be in the Flight Plan, 
we'll Jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. 
This clock update, which can be likened to going 
on daylight savingtime, only 2 hours and 40 minutes 
worth of change instead of i hour of change 


as we do on daylight saving time, will occur at 
65 hours when the crew will have completed all of 
those Flight Plan activities up through 67 hours 
and 40 minutes. (Chuckle) This simply involves 


setting our ciock to65 hours in the Control Center 
and aboard the spacecraft to 65 hours, moving them 


ahead to 67 hours and 40 minutes. Then, barring 


any further changes in the mission time line, from 
that point on, the elapsed time clocks, which are 


used as a cue to Flight Plan activities, should 
agree with the Flight Plan and events that, in the 
Flight Plan are called out for a certain time will 
happen at that time onthe elapsed time clocks 


(laughter) in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. 
(Laughter) This is a convenience factor. 


You're lucky; we're going to lose an omni. 


Okay. I'll hold off there for the rest. 


Gordy, never mind. I think I got the gist of it. 


Did you give up, Gordy? 


Okay. What we're really going to do -(chuckle) 
really is simple. At 65 hours we're going to do 
the update of 2 hours and 40 minutes. And the: 
procedures are shown in the Flight Plan at 67:35. 
There Just happens -happens to be really no -no 
activities we have to reschedule in the intervening 
time. So, after the update is complete, we'll be 
right on the Flight Plan, both timewise and activ


itywise. Over. 


Okay. We're looking at it. Going to have to 
squeeze my shave in somewhere else, I guess.

time I was up here looking back from this angle, 
they were moving another Saturn V for another Moon

working pretty feverishly out there on B. 
02 15 11 53 LMP Gordy, this is Jack. I think Gene was right. You 
got some -probably scattered cloud weather, but 
not very far away from you there's a pretty heavy 


Tape 44/4 
mass of clouds. It may be the forerunner of that 
dry cold front you were talking about yesterday, 
which I can see stretching over into Sonora. But 
where it hits the stateside, it's got quite a mass 
of clouds associated with it. It looks like they're 
moving in your direction. 
CC Okay, Jack, thanks for the warning. 
LMP Clear behind it, in Arizona and New Mexico and 
maybe southern Colorado, it looks like there may 
be another front stretching, or maybe it hits 
northern Arizona and Utah and up through northern 
Colorado, and on in to Canada, trending northeast. 
LMP You're calling it right on, Jack. I'm looking at 
the surface chart, and that's about what we see. 
LMP Looks like a low might be developing on that one -
a wave up in northern Colorado and -although the 
clouds are a little hard to read. 
CC Roger. 
Our sub -or our zero phase point -About 20 degrees 
west of Bolivia, our sub -our zero -zero phase 
point, and it is quite a bit brighter than yesterday 
and looks as if, and more general, as if maybe 
the seas have picked up in that region a little bit. 
CC Roger. 
LMP One of the more unusual features is developed -as 
I see -developed in the southeast Pacific Just 
north of the Ross Sea and that is a very striking 
mushroom pattern on a very large scale. It has 
north/south clouds streaming streamers from the 
Ross Sea. And when it gets up about the latitude 
of Tierra del Fuego, but quite a bit west of that 
land, it branches out to the east and west in a 
iarge mush-room pattern. And, it looks like the 
top of that mushroom may be a curved cold front 
that's pushing its way up into the southeast Pacific. 
It currently -the eastern edge of that 
front is probably l0 degrees longitude from Tierra 
del Fuego, and it looks like that land in southern

nine frames remaining now. The two nonscheduled 
magazines are 00 and PP; 160 frames each. Those 
are the ones provided for optional use. We have 
44 additional frames scheduled out of November 
November, scheduled during lunar orbit. There is 
only nine left in it now, so we'd like to save at 
least 60 frames out of either Oscar Oscar or Papa 
Papa, the two optional magazines, to cover the 
scheduled frames. Guess what we're saying is 
there is no problem. We've still got plenty of 
film, but you will have to use some of your optional 
mags for scheduled pictures. Sixty frames 
is what we want to save.

I -Cal Tech will never forgive me; I'm a little 
hesitant on my elementry optics. But I Just put 
Ron's polarizing filter in front of the monocular, 
looking at the Earth and rotate 90 degrees, and 
from max to min in terms of brightness, there's a 
remarkable change. And I suspect that means that 
the Earth is polarizing light enough to see it. 
The main thing that happens is that the oceans 
get considerably darker when I rotate the filter 
towards the dark position anyway. The continents 
don't seem to show any obvious change, but the 
oceans and the zero phase point darken -oh, I 
would guess by a factor of two in brightness. 
Maybe that's an extreme, but I think it's that. 


Roger. I was just trying to think of a reason. 
Is it uniform change over all ocean areas, or is 
it more of a change in some areas than others? 


Well, I'd say'that the subsolar point shows the 
greatest change, but you can still -the zero 
phase point shows the greatest change. But all 
the oceans get darker. 


Very interesting. We are just about to switch

Well, about all I can say is I'm a satellite 
guess. 


Gordy, it looks as if the distribution of water and 
ice in the ri -Ross Sea has changed in the last 
day or two. I don't remember looking at it yesterday 
specifically, but it seems to be different 
today than it was the first day. 


Roger. 


Houston_ 17. 


Go ahead, Jack. 


Yes, about this icepack in the Ross Sea. The -as 
I remember a couple days ago, there were two clear 
areas, triangular in shape and quite elongate, that 
were projecting out into the sea from the innermost 
part of the bay, or the -from the continent. 
Today those are not apparent, at least the first 


look I made. And it looks like there is an elon


gate, more irregular clear area that is roughly 
parallel to the Antarctic coastline within the sea 
itself. We'll check that a little more closely and 
see if that's right. 


Okay. Seems like kind of a quick change for something 
like ice, doesn't it? 


Yes, and that's what bothers me. That's why I 
wonder if I'm not being fooled by cloud patterns 
or something. 


I'm looking at a satellite picture here, which 
guess is around 12 hours old though. But over to 
the east of Australia, maybe about a continent 
width east or'Australia, there is really striking 
long frontal system -striking because it's so long 
and so straight, sort of west-northwest, trending 


west-northwest and east-southeast trending. Can 
you see that? 


Gordo, are you there? 


Yes, sir, right here.

Tape 44/11 


Okay. Now Jack and I may be talking about two 
different frontal systems or patterns, but the 
one I think you might be referring to is the one 
I referred to yesterday as a ruffled parrot's 
beak. Actually two of them tied together, one 
starting up probably southeast of Australia and and 
then heading down with a long arcing frontal 
system to another clockwise rotational parrot's parrot's 
cone, I should say, down around -near 


the tip of South America, between it and Antarctica. 
There is one strong tributary front heading up to 
the north-northwest from the western side of this 


big, arcing, frontal mass. And I think that's 
probably what you're referring to. I'm not sure. 
I can't quite see Australia coming up over the over 
the horizon yet. 


Okay. I -my picture cuts off right about the oh, 
two-thirds of the way south in Australia, that 
latitude. So most likely we're talking about the 
same thing, but I can't verify the southern part 


of it. 


There is some tremendous -western side of that 
curve front is a tremendous clockwise rotational 


airmass. It must cover hundreds of square miles. 
The one down near -near the continent of Antarc


tica, down there, near the tip of South America, 
seemed to be squashed slightly as if there is possibly 
some -some squashing or effect coming off 


off the South Pole area near Antarctica. I think, 
if I turn around and look at it the way Jack was 
looking at it, it's a cap of a mushroom. Only 
instead of simply curving in underneath the cap, 


it has clockwise rotations on both sides as it 


curves under. 


Roger.

CC Okay. To the west, it goes clear on over to Africa. 
But to the south, it cuts off about 30 south, or

the mushroom points north -is a major cyclone circulation 
system. And also taking -moving, in one

CDR Go ahead. 
CC Okay. According to all our experts here, the 
phenomena you're describing is pretty much the 
phosphene effect -sort of like when you rub your 
eyes or squint your eyes too hard -because the 
effect is lasting too long. The streaks or the 
flashing that we're looking for are very fast, and 
they do not remain as a scene to your eye. And I 
guess the only thing we could say would be to 
maybe either relax your squint a little bit or 
to ... the blindfold's on exceptionally tight. 
I know this sounds kind of screwy, but those are 
the words that we would like to -like to say to 
you. But the actual phenomena we're looking for 
will be a very short-lived phenomena. It will 
either be a flash or a very fast streak. Something

last one I remember before falling asleep -was 
the fact that there was a very bright spot that 
flashed right between my eyes like a very bright 
headlight -like a train coming at you, only with 
a flash. It's difficult probably to estimate the 


frequency of any of those because I was in a 


sort of a sleep-hazy mode.

air masses -one going from west to east and the 
other form east to west -have converged along 
that line, and the joint movement of air at the 
interface being south to north. And up in the 
area of Hawaii, I think, it tends to mushroom so 
that the pattern then goes back to flow from west

Gene, Houston. 


Stand by, Bob. 


Roger. 


Hello, Houston. Are you reading yet? 


Roger. Go ahead. 


Okay, Bob, curve looks good. I Just checked the 
DPS/APS crossover on the DPS available, and it 
comes out with what you gave me on the card 


about 2521. 


Roger. And Just one minor point. Across the top, 
on the velocity to be gained, you can bias all 
those n,_mbers -add a six to every one of them 
across the top, to be technically correct. 


Okay. 


The next thing we have on that, Gene -


... correct, I could have done that before I before 
I plotted the curve; but that's good. We 
understand, and we got it down. 


Okay. The next thing I've got is -that whole 
update column in the little block there is all 
updated; and we probably ought to get a readback 
on all these n_mbers, Gene. I can give it to you 
right like a regular pad, Just from the -right 


down from the top to the bottom, and then read it 
back to me. I think that'll be the best way, 


don't you? 


Okay. Ron's going to go ahead and take them; and 
we'll doublecheck them, and he'll read them back.

again, Regulus; I'm sorry, Regulus -Denebola and 
Regulus. And then, on that line, go perpendicular 
to that line right above Ri -right above Regulus,

up, Jack. Does it look 
is pretty well clobbered? 
LMP No, not really. New Guinea is at the western 
edge of a cloud zone that is part of that intertropical 
convergence zone that starts at New Guinea 
and swings east-northeast in an arc for about half 
the visible Pacific, and then that arc crosses 
back down over the equator and heads generally 
towards Central America, I suspect, although that's 
beyond the terminator now. The storm I'm talking 
about is clearly south and separate from that intertropical 
convergence cloud -pattern. 
CC Roger. 
LMP It's getting very tightly wound in the -the clockwise 
sense, and -and is -is Just where there was 
a less well-organized pattern yesterday. Although 
maybe it's moved northward a little bit.

in the Ross Sea -clear areas within the Ross Sea 
icepacks had changed, and I feel more strongly 
about that now. It looks like it's opened up considerably. 
The tri -long -elongate triangular 
areas, two of them that were there a couple of

clear water along most of the inner portion of the

Well, I'm very surprised that it's changed shape

clearer than the rest, but all three of you sound 
real clear and very readable. 
Excellent. That'll make up for my note taking. 



Tape 47/9 
CC Roger, And also, Jack. You had a question earlier 
about the different response of sea and continental 
areas when viewed through monocular polarizing filter, 
and I've got a note here from John Dietrich 
that kind of explains it. 
LMP Okay, let's hear what John has to say. 
CC Okay. This is pretty much referencing the time you 
were looking at it, and here it is. "Ocean scenes 
near the bright area off Bolivia, which is the 
spel -specular point, include a high proportion 
of polarized light. The spacecraft-Earth-Sun 
geometry now is approximately equal to the Brewster 
angle which is nearest 53 degrees, where maximum 
plane polarization due to reflection occurs. Therefore, 
a high response of scene brightness to changes 
of filter position can be expected. Continental 
scenes are dominated by Lambertian or diffuse reflectors, 
which are characterized by low proportion 
of polarization in the reflected beam. For such 
scenes, changing position of the polarization filter 
produces changes in scene brightness that are 
near or below the threshhold of detectability." 
Over. 
LMP Okay. That sounds very good. It's sort of like 
the contrast between the lunar surface response 
and -the oceans being more like that, I guess, 
and the -between the lunar surface and terrestrial 
land surfaces. 
CC Roger, Jack. 
LMP That's very good, very interesting. 
John for me. I should have thought 
but I've been away from it too long.

Say, Bob, I took another picture of the Earth and 
forgot to give you the GET on it. That was about 
15 minutes before the end of the ALFMED experiment, 
if you can go back that way. 


Okay. 


Let me see, Jack. We -the last thing we had was 
right about the end of it. We had you in Sierra 
Sierra, frame 50. And you had four pictures then. 
Is that before that or after that? Okay, those 
four were for the ALFMED, weren't they?

the EL camera. 


Oh, okay; got you. 


We had FAO working on matching that one up. 


Okay. 


Houston, 17. 


Go ahead, Jack. 


Roger. That weak front that I talked about south 
of Australia yesterday has moved north, but it 
looks considerably weaker than it did yesterday 
even. Just a very thin line of clouds -very thin 
line of clouds that now is touching the -the tip 


of Australia, south of Perth. 


Houston, 17. I think maybe you dropped out before 
I said that little weak front moving north-
northeast, south of Australia. The western end of 



Tape 47/13 
it is Just touching the coast of Australia, south 
of Perth, but it looks much weaker; and I, right 
now, would not expect very much weather out of it. 
CC Okay. That -I can't tie up with you on that one, 
Jack, because my prog doesn't go down that far; 
it only stays up in the landing area. And my 
satellite photo doesn't go down that far south 
either. So, I can't touch up with you on that one. 
LHP Okay. Well, it -it looked stronger yesterday, 
and it might have developed. Now there is a larger 
disturbance at the southeastern end of that front, 
still south of Tasmania; although, I suspect, unless 
it stays on a pretty northerly course, it will 
not affect the weather on the east coast of Australia 
very much. 
CC Roger.

Bob, you made some comment earlier about the 


weather. It may have been Hawaii, but you broke 


up. 


Roger; I just got the sequence report for Hawaii, 


and Hickam had 3500, scattered; 4500, broken with 


minor rain showers; and Hilo had about the same. 


And basically, it's Just their tropical puffy 


weather out there. The typical nothing. No 


frontal-type weather -no cyclonic-type weather. 


Okay. Well, it may be Just patterns induced by 


the -the wind currents, or maybe I don't have 


the position of Hawaii quite right. 


Well, it's -it's possible. You know they do have 
high winds out there, and I've seen it, Just fly


ing in that area in the past, where those broken 


clouds get pretty close together at times. It 


almost looks like a solid overcast. And especially 
when you look at it from an angle, they all blend 
together.

coffee, and let me make a note that the package of 
peaches in that pack had been -was broken in the

bread, orange drink, and four bacon squares. For 
dinner, I sort of ate some leftovers and grape 
drink, corn chowder, chocolate pudding. And I've 
had -Well, standby. The PRD reading: 24080;

half mustard, vanilla pudding, sugar cookies, grape

I might add that both of those alternatives have 
been -worked on. 


We thought probably so. 


Bob, although we're getting close to concentrating 


our attention on the Moon, it doesn't decrease the 


interest in looking back at the patterns of activity 
we can see on the Earth. That storm I talked about 
yesterday that was in North Africa, looks like it 
has left that area and has moved in -maybe, if it's 
there at all, it's Just over the -Iberian Peninsula. 
And maybe Gibraltar and that area is getting 
a little activity today.

it's dissipating and also staying south of that

convergence area where there's scattered patches 
of -of fairly dense clouds. They're probably 
getting scattered rain showers of some kind in 
there this morning. Some of those extend farther 


south than I've -than we've seen them -down into 
South Africa. There's a -On one of the earlier

Thank you. 


Okay.And, Jack, while you guys are finishing your 
lunch -your breakfast there, excuse me -Are you 
all on your headsets? 


Yes, sir. Go ahead. 


Okay. Let me brief you on a little funny that we 
we saw last night. And I'll start the briefing by 
mentioning that, at the present time, it is not a 
great concern; but just to keep you up to date 
with what's going on, let me mention it to you. 
About 70 hours, which was probably about the time 
of your last exercise period, we saw three funnies 
with the hydrogen tanks -as I say, none of which 
is causing any great concern. The first of these 
was a shift of the limits of the pressure switch, 


the one that turns the heaters on and off. Remember, 
there are two of those switches, one on tank 1 
and one on tank 2 and they work in series. And 


one of those switches -we can't tell which, but 
we suspect it's probably tsm_k 2 because of the 
other funnies I'll get to in a minute on tank 2 one 
of those switches went from a 1B-psi range; 


in other words, a plus or minus 6.5-psi range. 
It changed its range down to plus or minus 1.5 psi. 


So it's now -its total range is only B psi. The 


main result of that is that it means that the 
pressure switches and the motor switch turning the 


heater on acts more frequently over shorter periods 
of time. The second thing which we observed 


following this -and we're not at all sure if 
there is any correlation between this and the 
others -We observed a high-frequency pressure 


oscillation in tank 2. It was about a 5-psi peak


to-peak oscillation, a frequency of about 2 cycles 
per second. And this lasted about B to 5 minutes. 
A third funny that we observed -and this was in 
tank 2 -the third funny that we observed was an 


erratic -and possibly correlated with the high-


frequency oscillation -but an erratic total fuel 


cell currents, and here again we were looking at oh, 
peak-to-peak variations of something like 


5 amps, or of 5 to l0 amps. And the suspicion is 
that, coupled with the shift in the limits of the 
pressure switch, some acoustic vibrations were set

up in that tank -we may have seen them causing 


the oscillation of the motor switch, which was then 


reflected in the fuel cell currents. The -again, 


these erratic and possibly correlated fuel cell 


currents lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes. And 


since then, all during the night, they've [sic] 


been no further events of this sort; and the pres


sure switch with its reduced limits has been acting 


quite normally, just with the reduced limits over


night. As I say again, we're looking at it, people 


are studying it in great detail, with no real 


answer at the moment; but there is no great concern 


at present. And it appears that the worst that 


can happen is for the motor switch to "stale" be


cause of overuse. And if this were to happen, it 
would force us to go to man -manual management of 


the heaters on the H2 tank. But that appears at 


the moment to be the worst, that we can anticipate 


from this -from this group of funnies. Over. 


Okay, Bob. I understand that. You know, I wonder 
if we ought to stop stirring the cryos the way 
we've been doing it. 


That -that has been suggested, but -but, again, 


it's not very clear that any of these things are 
terribly correlated. 


Okay. Also, you know, if you want to reduce the 


activity on that switch -depending on how much 
you need to have it done during quiet periods, 


such as eat periods and things like that -we 


could go to manual operation. 


Negative, Jack, because the switch -0MNI Bravo, 
please, 17. 


... If you pull out your schematics there, you'll 
find that the -no matter what you do, the -you 
can turn the thing off, in fact, and the switch 
will continue to operate the motor switch -the 
pressure switch will continue to operate the motor 


switch off the service module buses. There's 
nothing you can do. The only thing you'll do if 
you go from AUTO to MANUAL or OFF is you'll keep 
the current from going to the heaters, but the 
motor switch will still operate.

LMP In a cycle very

4 or 5 seconds, is it possible 
to affect the tank that fast? 
CC That's not possible, so the only thing that really -
we think could -The tank is too much of a heat sink 
to do it that way. What may have happened was that 
if you set up an oscillation -a mechanical oscillation 
in the tank -through -one way or another, 
that this could then have acted back up on the motor. 
But the motor switch in driving the heaters could 
not have reinforced the oscillation because the 
tank is too much of a heat sink.

been able to correlate that exactly with the start

Well, you know you should be able to do that 


because of the biomed on -at least on me, and 


Ron was on, too. But, as soon as I started exer


cising, you should have the biomed data on my 
heart rate. It was an unscheduled exercise period. 
We Just went into it before an eat period there, I 
think. Let me check back. 


Okay. And we can check back and inform you more 
specific on what the times were there in terms of 
your exercise period, also. I'd like 0MNI Charlie, 


please, there, 17. And we might mention that 
oscillations like this have been seen on the ground 
under somewhat different circ_m_tances, but oscilla


tions like this have been seen on the ground in 
ground tests previously. And I might say, also, 
that as far as other things in the spacecraft are 
concerned, everything looks absolutely normal or 
nominal, as the case may be, and in great shape 


and emph -I'd emphasize again that we've seen 
none of this oscillation again since 71 hours. 
Over. 

Okay, Bob. That was, as you say, pretty close to 
the exercise. I can't pin it down in the checklist 
exactly, but it was somewhere after ALFMED was 
complete and before we changed that canister. 
think we changed that canister a little early, 


about 70:50. So I think the medic should have 
pretty good data on when we were exercising. And 
the reason I say that was because the way we were I 
was exercising anyway -I'm sort of running in 
place against the LEB and conceivably could have 
gotten an oscillation going in the tank. 


Roger. Understand that. 


0MNI Delta, 17. 


And, 17, we did a little -a little investigation 
of times down here. We found that at 71:12 you 
were exercising at 130 beats per minute, Jack. 
And we think the exercise period ended about 


l0 minutes later at 71:22. The H2 tank funnies 
started at about 71:37 with the pressure switch 
shift and 71:42 with the oscillations. Over. So, 


there it's -oh, at least 15 minutes after the 
exercise period was over.

fairly -fairly heavily all night; there's a lot 


of water standing around. Temperatures here are 
in the high 50's, but it's supposed to get a little 
cooler tonight with a low in the 40's. I think 


you know how the Dallas-Redskin game came out -the 


only thing additional mentioned here is that chances 
look good now that Washington and Dallas may meet 
in the rubber games for the National Conference 
representative in the SuperBowl. In the other 
pro game yesterday, a field goal by Don Cockroft 
was the difference in a 26-to-24 win by Cleveland 
over rival Cincinnati. Other sports highlights: 
The Pittsburgh Steelers play the Oilers today in 
the Dome. Other big games will be Atlanta at San 
Francisco, Green Bay at Minnesota, and Baltimore 
at Kansas City. Tennessee State beat Drake University 
in the Pioneer Bowl 29 to 7. And East 
Texas State beat Carson Newman in the NAIA football 


playoffs. The Southwest Conference has pulled out 
of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Some college 
basketball scores: The Houston Cougars routed 
Xavier last night out at Hofheinz Pavilion ll4 to 
7B; and Rice downed George Washington 93 to 89. 
Geno, you'll be glad to hear Purdue ripped TCU 
101 to 70, and it was Texas over Oklahoma State 
86 to 66. And SMU over Oklahoma City 106 to 8B. 
We couldn't find any score at Cal Tech, Jack, but Switch 
to OMNI Bravo, please. But one final score, 
Ron, Kansas lost to Iowa 69 to 56. The only thing 
new on the plane crash Friday in Chicago -it's 
reported here that the plane was apparently waved 



Tape 55/11 
_ 
off because another plane was still on the assigned 
runway. The Democratic Party's stormy session 
in Washington saw the old-guard Democrats apparently 
take back control of the Party from pro-
McGovern forces. Mrs. Jean Westwood was replaced 
as Party Chairman by Texas lawyer/businessman 
Robert Strauss. Former-president T_mAU appears 
to be more than holding his own at a hospital in 
Kansas City. There's a good chance the 88-yearold 
former Chief Executive may be taken off the 
critical list. There's been a 1-day interruption 
in the secret peace talks between Dr. Henry 
Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. The two conferred for 
over 3 hours yesterday. Both sides have agreed 
not to talk to newsmen on any s_stantive matters. 
In other news highlights, President Nixon has 
named Daniel Moynihan as U.S. Ambata -Ambassador 
to India. And Chilean President Allende has flown 
to Cuba to vis -to visit Fidel Castro. Here's 
an interesting one. A 45-year-old pilot lost in 
the Arctic for 31 days has been found alive and well. 
Three companions were killed. The Soviet Party 
boss Leonid Breshnev has delayed a scheduled visit 
to the U.S. It looks as if the visit may come in 
the fall rather than this coming spring. One last 
note: The news media says that the flight of 
Apollo 17 is the smoothest on record so far, and 
I call that last one pretty accurate reporting.

Okay. A little more parochial news. I haveyour

right on the preflight lines. Over.

Okay, Gordy. How would you like a hydrogen purge 


this morning? 


... mRke sure. 


Go ahead, Houston; 17. 


17, we do want the hydrogen purge; go ahead. 


Okay, hydrogen purge is in process. You'd never 


believe it, dust collection container assembly 


serial number 5725 developed a hole in it. 


Fortunately, with a lot of dexterity, I was able 


to put a piece of tape over the hole. 


Okay. I guess that's why we sent men into space. 


(Laughter) Right. 


Gordy, while the purges are going on here, I might 
mention, a little while ago, I looked at the Earth 
through a Polaroid colored glass again and had a 


full view of Africa. And it appeared as if, in the 
red and yellow portions of Africa, that the land 
areas darkened considerably more than those areas 
that are green or foliated, and that would be the 


central portion; that is, they darkened with the

LMP Gordy, it looks like the cloudiness and possibly 
the showers associated with the intertropical convergence 
over Africa are moving as far south as 
Johannesburg right now. It's quite a distinct 
change from even an -an hour or so ago -a couple 
of hours ago. They're down into an area where, 
presumably, they're not normally found if vegetation 
indications are any criteria. And also, in the 
Atlantic -South Atlantic near Goa Island, there 
seems to be a possible storm developing as part of 
what was probably now a fairly weak front. And 
whether or not that will develop into anything and 
move in towards Capetown is hard to say at this 
time.

voice through Ascension; no problem. Over. 


Okay, Gordy. How did you reach us when you finally 
started calling? 


Stand by. 


Jack, we didn't do anything to cause the problem 


there, we were up-linking through Madrid amd down-


linking through Ascension. Did you see anything 


on board that could have caused the loss of lock? 


No, sir. We had good signal strength. It wasn't 
peaked for the high gain. It was more like an omni 
signal strength, about 70 percent. And we called 


you several 
times after the switch in lines, and 


then finally you came through clear, but with some 
background noise and sounded like VHF. I presume 
it wasn't, now. And when you called, I went to 
OMNI Alfa, with no change in signal strength, still 
about 70 percent, and you were still coming up the 
same way and apparently didn't hear us. And then 


the high gain -with high gain acquisition, it's 
been pretty clear. 


Okay, that's the way -that story's the way it 
sounded to us. And we're looking around here to 
see if we can figure out a reason for loss there.

you tell me which is the North and which is the 
South Pole?

LM towards the Sun is probably the north. 
CC Roger. 
CDR Hello, Gordy. I -I think I got it. Window -
the -the north has got to be on the right as I 
look at the limb of the Moon opposite the Sun. 
Because when we go into retrograde attitude, it's 
got to be over there. I think I can see Korolev 
without any problem. It's a little bit north of 
the -of the equator. 
CC Roger. 
CDR Gordy, are you still with us? 
CC That's affirm. I'm with you, and I'm getting 
lots of advice here. 
CDR Okay. Okay. I'll bet you are. But I -I think 
I got it oriented. You can literally watch yourself 
fall down in. As we get closer, if we're 
going to have a view like this, it's going to be 
pretty dramatic. Because we're calling the way 
you climb on out of the Moon when you leave it, 
if you can see. And I remember remarks at that 
time, "Gee, if we could see it like this when we 
came back in, we'd have to close our eyes." If 
we can see this thing coming in like I think we 
maybe able to see it at 50 miles, it isn't going 
to look like very much.

Now I guess it depends on the shadowing of the 


Sun as to whether or not we're going to see too 
much. I think retrograde, we ought to see quite 


a bit once we get over the terminator. 


Gordy, there's enough of the lighted portion of 


the Moon where you can see the relief -not Just 


a shadowing relief, but the actual relief of 


several craters as they stretch across the terminator, 
both to the north and to the south. I can 
see even more definite relief now on the horizon, 


Just to the north and behind Korolev -on the 
black horizon against space.

The -the unlit part of the Moon, as you might 
expect, is Just as dark from here as is deep space 
itself.

It's black, I might say at this point.

Yes. It's 5000 feet per second. You're

Okay. I assume T. P. is there, and I guess John 
is, too. I don't know if John saw this coming in 
on 16, but I know they can recall what we saw 
leaving on 10. And other than the fact that you 


can't see as much of the Moon, it's Just as 


impressive. 


Roger. I was Just talking to John about it a 
couple of minutes ago. Their view on 16 was they 
didn't have any sunlit Moon, but they did 
have some pretty good earthshine. 


Well, he -he knows what I'm talking about then. 


Gordy, it's an unbelievable view through the 


monocular now. You can really see down in the 
depths of some of the larger craters and with a 
great deal of clarity. And you can see the -some 


of the higher ridges actually rolling right over 
the horizon as they go away from you. 


Roger, Geno. 


Hey, Houston. As much as I hate to, I think we're 
going to have to maneuver out of this attitude. 


Roger. As you take your last look there, you're 
presently 20 -Just a little over 2000 miles up, 
and you're coming down about 4500 feet per second. 


Yes. You'd better believe that. 


Gordo, there's only one better view than this. 


What's that, Gene? 


Right at the moment anyway. Right at the moment 
anyway, is to be out there and watching this space

Itwas anauto ignition. It was an auto shutdown. 


I think any comments during the burn are on the 


tape. But, to me, it was probably the smoothest 


and quietest SPS burn I ever remember.

it bounced around a lot, in bouncing arou -it was 


initially for about a minute -around -oh, 1.8 


decrease, then it gradually started to diverge from 


that to a more decrease, down to about 2.5 or make 


that 3 decrease. And I went to DECREASE on the 


switch; and about the time of crossover, I had it 


at -oh, about i decrease and it crossed over and 


stabilized at zero, and I went to NORMAL and it 


stayed there the rest of the burn -until just near 


the end, it started to go decrease again. 


Okay, we copy that, Jack. 


Okay, Gordo, did you by any chance get the S-IVB 


impact? 


We're -Okay, the new impact time for that is 89:39, 
so we haven't quite got there yet. 


Okay. Thank you. 


And, Houston -Ron here. Something a little bit of 


a surprise to me. When I turned on bank A, the 


chsmber pressure came up to 87 percent, and stayed 
there essentially. Five seconds later, I put on 


band B, the chamber pressure rose to 90 -about 91 


somewhere in that area. And then, throughout the 
burn, chamber pressure increased, which you'll see 


on the strip chart. But I was sure surprised at 


only 87 percent when we started it. It looked like 
the velocity gained versus time was correct throughout 
the burn, though. The maximum the chamber pressure 
ever got to was about 97 percent, and that was 


toward the end of the burn.

an opportunity to look at Korolev, at a very low 
grazing Sun, one of the striking things was the 


to me was the extreme absence of relief, the very 
smooth surface that existed in Korolev, independent, 
of course, of the craters that are penetrating 
that surface. And it looked like there was a ring 
in the floor -outsi -next to the wall about maybe 


one-sixth of a crater radius that was somewhat 
brighter at the low grazing Sun, suggesting it 
may have had a different slope. And I believe I'm 


correct in saying that the inner floor maybe 


slightly raised. We'll try to make other 


observations this next time around on that one, 
but there was Just a very smooth floor. The light 
plains material in that crater is very smooth.

Gordy? 


Loud and clear, Jack. 


Thank you. Okay, good. All right, I've got a 
visual on Eratosthenes and Copernicus. The -there 
are obviously different-age craters in this light. 
You can see the ray patterns in Copernicus 


moderately well. You can even tell that they do 


cross Eratosthenes. Stadius shows up as a very 


clear dark area to the southwest of Eratosthenes. 
Now, one of the things that we mapped on the 
southeast and south rim of Copernicus were dark 


albedo areas within the eJecta. And those are 


apparent here, very clearly. And also, within on 
the upper portion of the rim and on the benches, 


in that quadrant. The walls-there are the dark 
spots -lower albedo material that we mapped. They 
are -form linear patterns along the benches, 
apparently. Although the bench -the topography 
is not too clear. But the dark spots are in 
arcuate linear arrangement parallel to the rim. 
And they appear to have -be elongate along 
radius -along the radius of the crater. 


Roger, Jack. 


This isinthesoutheast -southeast quadrant I'm 
referring to. Copernicus H is also very obvious 


as a dark-rimmed crater, relative to the albedo 
of the ejecta blanket. And the northwest quadrant, 
which we mapped as a smooth floor material and 
somewhat darker albedo, is just as apparent here, 
although all the contrasts, of course, are less. 
The main thing that you can pick out in earthshine 


are albedo distinctions. Now -now we -we -I 


remember that we also, at one time -and I can't 
remember whether it made the final map or not mapped 
an arcuate fault structure, based on the 
change in albedo. And this was on the southwest 
quadrant of Copernicus. And that crossed the 


southern rim, more or less north-south, went down 
and curved across the floor and up the southwest 
rim, and that is a very clear arcuate pattern in 
this lighting. Darker albedo than the rest of the

crater. And along the arc, there appear tobe a 


couple or three even darker spots -much as we 


thought we saw in some of the early photography. 


Roger. 


There is a general streaking -radial streaking 


within that arcuate dark area that radiates 


radially from the crater, and if I had to project, 


the dark area would, -north -whose northeast 


terminus is the arc in the crater, I'd project it

maybe. Now there's -I'm getting -essentially

the crater wall are still apparent, and the 
stre-_iug or the radial elongation of these spots 
is clear. Now, on the lower wall -that's below

areas, and on the next wall above that, above the

a couple that are somewhat more subtle.

we're Just about to fly a little bit south of 


Grimaldi. That edge is very irregular. There is 
no obvious indications that it -there are large 
basins that have been flooded by mare that have 


formed that edge, but, again, the topographic distinction's 
possible in this lighter small. Now I'm

That's the small craters. There, in the Mare 


Procellarum closest to Grimaldi, there are two 


arcuate rilles. Look like they are probably 


V-shaped in their cross section. I'm sure we've 


seen those on the photographs much better than I 


can see them here. Those -the rille patterns, 


though, do seem to project over into the highlands. 


Okay. 


To the north of that -to the north of that bay 


of mare. Just interrupt. 


Hey, I just saw a flash on the lunar surface! 


Oh, yes? 


It was just out there north of Grimaldi. Just 
north of Grimaldi. You might see if you got anything 
on your seismometers, although a small impact 
probably would give a fair amount of visible light. 


Okay. We'll check. 


It was a bright little flash right out there near 
that crater. See the crater right at the edge of 
Grimaldi. Then there is another one north of it. 
Fairly sharp one north of it is where there was 
just a thin streak of light. 


How about putting an X on the map where you saw it.

I -I was planning on looking for those kind of 


things. Starting to see the edge of Orientale, 


Gordy. Way off to the west. Hey, just yell, 


Gene, anytime you --


Gordy, to the north of Grimaldi there is a large 
basin that is about the same size but only incom


pletely filled with mare in its northeastern 


quadrant. The rest of it looks like a fairly ir


regular and h_mmocky floor material of some kind.

But it's almost the same size as Grimaldi. It even 
looks like it is a little bit deeper, but, of 
course, Grimaldi has considerable fill. Grimaldi 


on its eastern edge has some of the graben, or it's 
rim, if you will, is cut by three or four anastomosing 
grabens that make it look like some of the 
bench areas in the larger basins. 


Okay, the first ring of Orientale is showing up. 


The inner -next ring in is extremely obvious; got 


some very bright east -east-facing slopes. 


I'll turn off the intercom. 


It has some very bright east-facing slopes, and you 
can see the bands of mare that are filling the both 
the first bench area and the inner bench. 


Any time you need us, Gordy, Just interrupt me. 


Okay; we'll do that. 


Now, as I look north along the first bench, that's 


the first bench from the outside, one inside the 


Cordillerian ring. I better check that; I may have 
my names mixed up. Got Orientale, there -handy? 
See it. Should be on there. Yes, this is what I 


need. What's the name -they got a name on that 
ridge, there? That's Rook Mountains. Yes, the 


Cordillera. Yes, that's right. Looking Just west 


of the Cordillera on the first bench, as I look 
north, in this light, which is casting some shadows 
now, Gordy, over in the area, it looks extremely 
smooth. Now this is not mare; it's lighter albedo, 
lighter reflectivity than the mare, and, although 
there are patches of mare in the lower areas in it. 
But looking along that plain, in fact, a lar -long 
linear plain, it -it looks quite smooth with only 
some very broad undulations that appear to be 


roughly radial to Orientale itself. The more closer 
we get to it, the more I see minor relief 
showing up. I start to see the shadows, I guess. 


And that relief seems to bring out a hummocky texture 
in -in addition to the craters you would 
expect to see there. 

Roger.

Iwon't try to give you a trend on the hummocks 
because I think the shadows are biasing my view; 
they do appear to be north-south trending, but I 
think that is because of the shadow patterns. This 


is a spectacular sight, you guys; you ought to take 


a look at Orientale. One of the largest fresh 
basins on the Moon. It still is probably 2 billion 
years old, or 3.8 at any rate, if our dating cri


teria are any -any good. It has the outer Cordillerian 
ring and the inner ring called the Rook 
Mountains -very, very nicely shown. There are 
massifs on that inner ring, the Rook Mountain ring; 
there are massif complexes much like what we'll 
be studying at Taurus-Littrow. There are low areas, 
non_mare areas, that are comparable to some -to the 
Taurus -the valley that we'll be landing in. And, 


all in all, I think we'll find that our ring in the 
Taurus-Littrow area around Serenitatis is comparable 
in many regards to this Rook Mountain ring around 
Orientale. You want -did you interrupt, Gordy? 


No. I didn't say anything. 


Okay; I thought I heard your key. Okay; in the 


inner portion of Orientale, as we approach a terminator, 
the lighting is still excellent. Matter 
of fact, it appears brighter than what we were 
looking at over at Copernicus. Now, part of that 
may be we're seeing much sharper relief since the 
slope -Earth-facing slopes are nicely lit, and 
the backfacing slopes, of course, are in shadow. 
The first portion of the bench inside the Rook 
Mountains is partially filled by mare. Now, the 
higher land in there is very smooth, in a gross 
sense, is a very smooth hl_mmocky terrain, cut by 
roughly circumferential grabens. The trend of the 
hl_mmoeks themselves are not radial; they're more well, 
they're about a 45-degree angle to the radius. 
They, in detail, have a much finer hackly texture, 
much like we've been able to see on photographs 
before. And, in general, you get the impression 
that, in several areas here, that that hackly text'mred 
surface is draped over material that resembles 


the massifs of the Rook Mountains themselves. 
There's one area just to the north now of our track 
where there's a large, roughly equidimensional 


mountain mass, with a few projections of massiflike 
peaks through this hackly textured surface.

There are also some radial grabens; I just now 
picked one up, which we've also seen on the Orientale 
photographs taken by Lunar Orbiter. It's 
amazing how fresh appearing this basin looks, considering 
its great age. But it's -it probably is 
not -had any more violent a history than Imbrium. 
Now, we're getting up, Just about to go over a 


delta-rim crater that's out in the basin. I don't 


remember the name of it offhand. But it's -should 
be familiar to some of the geologists who have mapped 
this basin. It does not appear to have a strong 


impact eJecta blanket around it. It's filled with 
mare, and it's quite sharply in contrast to a crater 
of comparable size to the northwest. See that 
one, Ron; I don't know whether you can get it. I 
get a good view out of 5 now of that one. And, 
once again, it looks as if this hackly textured 


material that forms the higher hills in the inner 
bench -has a draped appearance over the, over 


preexisting terrain, and, in fact, along the ridges 


of the hmlmmoeks, you -we now can pick up little 


rilles that roughly parallel the hummocks, although 


not -not -not consistently. They do cross down 


into the valleys. But it has appearance that there 


may have been a tensional relief along the crest of 


each of the hl_mOcks, or many of the h-mmocks. 


Roger. 


Delta-rim crater Just as has been, I think, dis


cussed in the literature, has just that delta 


rim with no obvious ejecta blanket around it, com


pared to other larger craters within the basin. 


We're directly over that crater right now. It's 


filled with mare, very smooth mare. Matter of 


fact, within that fill, I can see no -no craters. 


Gettingvery close to the Earth terminator, but you 


see good texture in the eJecta blanket of the large 


crater in the north part of the inner basin of 


Orientale. The radial ridge and valley patterns 


are very clear; the concentric coarse hummocks near 


the rim are apparent; and you can even see the 


second -patterns of secondaries, the larger sec


ondaries, extending out away -radially out away 


from that crater. The south -the mare fill in

Better let him say something before AOS. 


I ain't got nothing to say. 


Houston, I guess we're getting close to AOS. We're 
getting close to AOS. Do you have some words for 
us? 


Okay. We show about 9 minutes to LOS. We'd like 
to clarify one thing, and that was on this tape 
recorder commands and high and low bit rate. And 
we Just want to make it clear that preburn the 


6 minute callout is HIGH BIT RATE, RECORD, FORWARD, 


COMMAND RESET. Did you -did you tell us a few 
minutes ago that you did indeed do all those at 


about 6 minutes? 


Yes, Gordy, I certainly thought I did, but I can't 


specifically -I know the HIGH BIT RATE was there, 
because we switched to LOW later. I can't -I'm 


afraid I can't specifically verify the COMMAND 
RESET. 


Gordy, I can specifically say that when those 


after the bus stars came on, we called that out. 
I'm almost sure Jack did get it, because I had him 
then check the helium valves and the nitrogen helium 
and the nitrogen valves. 


Okay. We're just trying to make sure if we -or 
to determine if we do have a switch problem. The 
INC0 did send LOW BIT RATE, COMMAND, Just prior 
to -to LOS there before LOI, which is the way it's 
called out in the Flight Plan. And then you should 
have come along later with a COMMAND RESET, setting 


the switch to HIGH BIT RATE, and the COMMAND RESET 


switched into HIGH BIT RATE mode, and for some reason 
it did not go into HIGH BIT RATE. 


Well, you want to test it out here, before we go 
around?

LMP Those frames that Ron mentioned -this is Jack -
that he mentioned were taken of a area where there's 
a much lighter gray albedo. Rather than the tannish 
gray, it's pure gray material that generally is on 
the rim crest of a number of craters. It may be 
related to the swirls that we see elsewhere.

that irregular. Not in great areas, but in small 
areas around on the southern side, and the part 
that looks like it's a water-washing pattern is of 
a much lighter albedo, although I cannot see any 
real source for it. The texture, however, looks 
about the same.

tell you, in the mare, there just is no visible 


relief. Although there seem to be some sinuous 


systematics anyway to the distribution. Like, 


there'll be a very dark area associated with the 


light area. And that dark area is darker than the 


mare. I think the pictures'il show that. Now, in 


the highlands, however, the -the light albedo 


areas, which are very comparable, that appear to be 


swirllike patterns of the same type, seem to be 


associated with a crest of crater ridges and other 


high points. We're on over -right over a concen

And there still seems to be no relief associated 
with it. Although, in many cases, it seems to 
follow ridge lines, or crater rims part way. In 


other cases, it's quite irregular in its 
distribution. 


Okay. 


And bank A, that time, with the chamber pressure, 
was up to 95. 


Roger, Ron. And we got tracking data on you; has 
a 13.1 perigee -peri -perilune, rather.

Okay, that's great, Bob, and we're still looking 


at that zero bias on the DC meter of about 5 to 


7 psi. 


Roger. 


Okay. 


Some of the boys might be interested to know that 
in a place where the Sun is just grazing the slope it's 
a steep slope on the north rim of Crisium, 


I can see the horizontal lineaments that were 


such a controvery on 15. 


Roger. Understand. The north rim of Crisium? 


... big one with the central peak. 


Roger. There are some very steep slopes that 


just have grazing Sun on them now, and with the 
binocs, you can see that horizontal lineation 


pattern. 


Roger. 


There it is. T-horizon will be good. Yes. Okay, 


I've got the edge of Crisium now .... Getting 
hills on the side of Crisium, there. Sure a lot 
smoother-looking material than I thought it would 
be.

CDR Could you see anything that looks like the slide? 
CMP Oh, yes. You can see the slide on the thing and 
definitely see the scarp going across through 
there. I was primarily concentrating on looking 
for the various craters so I didn't spend that 
much time, you know, concentrating on how the 
thing looked. But in the marks on the thing, the 
first about four or five marks were on F Crater 
and then I saw Sherlock about halfway through it 
and I got about five marks on the Sherlock for 
17-1.

horizontal lineations, but they're at the southern

binoculars. Don't take any of your eat or sleep 


time at all, but you might get a chance on this 


one eat pass to, as you go by there. 


Okay. I'll give her a try. You might give me a

I'm not sure the attitude is too good for that. 


I wish I'd thought of it this round. 


Roger. Well, we were pretty busy coming up on

board to see if -did you test it out thoroughly 
to make sure it wasn't working, or was that Just 
your desire not to use it? 
CDR We tried it, Bob, and it did not work. The only 
reason I'm reluctant on a test is I Just don't 
want it to take much time. 
CC I don't think it would take much time. The only 
thing I could say is it would -you know -two 
obvious things I'm sure you checked them, Gene, 
would be the utility power and make sure you had 
the right lamp tests on when you tried it, and 
that's the only -I'm sure you did it, and that's 
the only obvious thing -maybe a circuit breaker 
or something like that. 
CDR Well, we checked it both on the left side and on 
the right side with two separate UTILITY POWERs 
and verified that the MASTER ALARMs came on with 
the test on both sides, and nothing ever happened.

CDR No. Go ahead, Bob. 
CC Okay. There's not a whole lot of news on the 
wire tonight, matter of fact. President Nixon 
received a firsthand report on private Vietnam 
peace negotiations today from a key member of the 
U.S. negotiating team, General Alexander Haig, Jr., 
Henry Kissinger's Chief Lieutenant. Haig flew 
back from Paris to report to the President, while 
technical experts from both sides held an unusual 
Sunday meeting in the French capitol. Presidential 
Assistant Kissinger will res_n_e his talks with 
North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho on Monday after a 
1-day recess. And former President Harry Truman 
continued to show some signs of improvement late 
today after he was earlier removed from the critical 
list at Research Hospital up , up in Kansas 
City. His cardiac situation has improved, and 
this improvement included a slower and stronger 
pulse and a stable blood pressure. The football 
scores are as follows in the National Football 
League today: The Bears defeated the Eagles 
21 to 12; the Detroit Lions and the Buffalo Bills 
played to a 21-21 standoff; Dolphins extended 
their undefeated streak 23 to 13 over the New 
York Giants; the Patriots defeated the New Orleans 
Saints 17 to 10; Green Bay sewed up the Central

Division of the NFC by defeating the Vikings 
23 to 7; the Cardinals upset the Rams today 24 to

upset Baltimore 24 to 10; the 49ers defeated the 
Falcons 20 to nothing, 20 to 0; and Pittsburg 
defeated Houston 9 to 3, and they -they took 
the Central Division of the AFC. So the playoff 
picture is becoming a little clearer. You've 
got -In the NFC, you've got Washington, Dallas, 
and Green Bay. And the fourth team will either 
be San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Atlanta. That 
will be decided next week. In the AFC, Pittsburg,

Roger. 


And, Bob, while we're gradually getting in eon-


figuration here, let me reiterate something that 


I've been watching this rev as we did a lot of 


other things. And that was this relationship of 
the light-colored or light gray swirl patterns on 


the surface to patterns -associated pattern parallel 
patterns that are darker than the average 


of the surrounding area. And this is true both 


in Mare Marginis and in most cases on the back 


side. 


Roger, Jack. We'll get that tothe PI. 


Roughly, although they're very irregular patterns roughly 
it's concentric zoning of dark to light 
within a intermediate albedo surface. Now there 


are variations on that theme; sometimes you don't 


get the symmetry quite as good, but it's common 


enough that I think it's worth noting. 


Roger. 


Also, there's a sequence of different kinds of 


crater filling on the far side, and I think that, 
as the orbital stay progresses, we may be able to 
pin down the relative age relationships and the 
characteristics of those crater fill -filling 


episodes. Whether they are single episodes that 


happen in a variety of crater or they're a function 


of the age and characteristics of the craters in 


which you find them is not clear right now, but 


the -they seem to form fairly distinct groupings 


of crater-fill material. 


Roger. Jack. 


One of those crater-fill materials that you also 


see in other kinds of depressions other than cra


ters is a very smooth, light, plains-forming 


material. And it is, although eratered, when you 


see it at the terminator, it is smoother than the 


mare; that is, it does not seem to have the swell, 


the sea swell characteristics or ridges or 


other features other than the crater's superimposed 


on it.

Geno, Houston, with a couple of items. 
Go ahead, Gordo.

we got the landing site, Gordo. 
Okay. I'll hold --
Gordo, we got the landing site. We're coming 


right over the front of it. Stand by a minute.

going to set this baby down. 
CC Very good. 
CDR-LM As a matter of fact, I can see Rudolph. I can 
even see the triangle: Rudolph, Frosty, and 
Punk. Man, Gordo, this is absolutely spectacular.

CC Roger. 
04 12 21 38 LMP-LM Gordo, you can go ahead and update us with those 
words. 
04 12 21 41 CC Okay. Your perilune is shifting west. PDI will 
be a little higher than nominal: 10.7 miles or 
65,000 feet; should be no problem. And, from the 
time you first came around until we had a solid 
lockup on the steerable on this acquisition was 
about 3 minutes. We're going to try to speed that 
up some on the next time around. We'd like you to 
just keep trying the steerable until we come to 
you -and say, "stop trying." Over. 
04 12 22 14 LMP-LM Okay, Gordy, understand that; and apparently this 
time, had I let it -had I waited a little longer, 
it would have dropped to zero and then come up, 
because that's what happened when I finally got 
you. I'll give it more time next time.

Challenger, Houston. Your DPS OXIDIZER PRESSURE

Thank you, Gordy. 


Gordy, while the P57 is doing its gravity work, 
let me say that the LNA and the landing site, 
'from a relief point of view, I -I think, are 
identical. I -I couldn't say enough for the LNA. 
I actually didn't look around nearly as much as I 
thought I would, or as I wanted to, because I had 
fixation on -on a reasonable spot to land. They're 
not all reasonable in that there's some very subtle 
hl_mmocky-like craters right in and around where we 
are. And there's not a -a lot of boulders laying 
on the surface, but there's a lot of what appear 
to be boulders that are covered up by some of the 
dark mantle. Numerous enough that you would not 
like to take a chance at putting a -a pad down 
on one of them or in one of those hnmmocky subtle 
craters. As a result, I really didn't have a 


chance to look all around at where I wanted to 
except to put the bird down where I wanted it. 


Okay. We've got no complaint with that. 


I guess the thing that probably -probably surprised 
me most about the site, as far as landing 
is concerned, is the fact that there were these 


these -I hesitate to say they're outcrops but 
certainly they're buried massive pieces of rock 


whether they're boulders or not, we'll have to 
find out -out here in the plains area, partially 
covered and filleted by the dark mantle. And I 


expected to find a number of craters, but I guess 
I really didn't expect to find -to find the the 
rock types around. And we're talking about 
anywhere from i to 2 meters down to -oh, 2 or 
3 feet, which when they're sticking out and on 


the sides of some of these subtle craters look 


pretty menacingly. But that probably is the one 
thing that surprised me most.

The visibility prior to pitchover was such that i 
could see Nansen. I could see the Scarp. I could 
see Lara. I could not see Camelot until after 


pitchover. However, once I had pitchover, if I 
could have froze it right there like we do in the 
simulator occasionally, I could have picked out 
everything there was to see. Even at 6000 feet, 
the small triangle with Frosty and Rudolph and 
Punk were visible to me. I had -I had Poppy 


from orbit, as a matter of fact, so it was easily 
-easy to see. Barjea was a very sharp 
round crater Just as depicted on the LNA. The 
thing I really didn't get a good look at, because 
I didn't pay too much attention to it, was from 


Trident on to the south. 


Roger. 


Gordy, this is the LMP. Let me say -Gordy, this 
is the LMP. Let me say that the inside of the 
spacecraft looked just like the simulators. 


Very good, Jack. 


Another interesting thing, Gordy. All the way 
through PDI prior to pitchover, Jack and I had had 
the real America -or the other America 


right out -smack out the front window all the 
way down, which was pretty spectacular. 


I bet it was. And you can consider yourself

Gordy, let me con_nent about the handling of the 
bird. After you once fly it around in orbit a 
little bit, you get accustomed to the thrusters, 
and it -it came back to me quite a hit from 10, 
anyway. And you get a feel for acceleration and 
deceleration as well as the attitude hold capability. 
And it really -the response, even with 
a heavy descent -descent stage near the surface is

the light, I think. And I heard Jack call it -
the CONTACT light. I think I waited about a 
second and -and hit the stop button. She shut 
down immediately. And, of course, you could feel 
the fall. I don't really feel we fell that much, 
but it was quite a change in acceleration at that 
point.

Okay. 


We just want to confirm. You're referring to 
Trident 1 as the easternmost part of Trident, is 
that right? 


No, sir, Gordo. It's always been the westernmost 
part of Trident. The -the landing site was on 
a line between Trident i and Rudolph and judging 
from what Jack's got on his right-hand window and 
what I got on my left-hand window we're right 
there, except possibly a skosh further south on 


that line. 


Okay, understand. 


Andthe target point that was in thePGNS was 
right up where we all had expected itto be about 
halfway between here and what we're calling the 
rim of Camelot. We can't see into Camelot; we 
can just see the rim of it. It's several -oh, 
at least 200 meters -2 to 300 meters up there, 
Iexpect. 


Okay, what o'clock position is the west -the 


nearest part of the rim of Camelot? Or maybe if 


it's better defined -


12 o'clock. 


--Define the south rim. Can you see the south 


rim of it? 


Yes, Gordy, but it -it blends in so well; all 
we're seeing is a -an undulating high as the rim. 


And to the best of my knowledge, we've got the 
south rim at -or correction, the east rim right 
at 12 o'clock. Hey, Gordy, right at 12 o'clock 
also is a boulder that's at least 3 meters and 
maybe 5, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you 
can find it. It's on a line between us and the 
intersection of the South Massif and the Family 
Moun -Mountain horizon. Just slightly left of 
that line or south of that line. And that boulder 


ought to show up on your best photography.

Question --
LMP-L_M And it's at -it's at least -that boulder's at 
least 200 meters away. 
CC Okay. Can you see the west rim of Trident, and 
can you give us a clock position on the west rim 
of West Trident? 
CDR-LM Okay, Gordy. The west rim of Trident, which, by 
the way, is full of outcropping-looking boulders, 
is at l0 o'clock. 
CC 0kay, Gene --
CDR-LM Okay, I can look back around the corner now and 
I can -I can see where the east -where Trident 1 
rose up to its rim on the east side, and I would 
say we're abeam of a point -abeam of a point 
one-third the way from east to west up the center 
of Trident; that is, we're -we've covered one-
third of Trident I and we're abeam of a point of 
a line that goes through the one-third point from 
east to west of Trident 1. 
CC Okay, Gene; that' s very clear. I think we 've got 
you pretty well nailed down. And you're pretty 
close to the -the planned landing site. 
CDR-LM Yes, I think it's very close to our planned landing 
site and I -I'm (chuckle) -I'm anxious to 
see where Poppy is, because I think what I said 
earlier is true.

Gordy, Houston; 17. How do you read -or Challenger 
or whoever we are? 


Whoever you are; you're loud and clear. 


I took the binocs and looked at some large boulders 
at our 12 o'clock posit_on. They're probably on 
the order of a half meter to 2 meters, buried but 


without strong filleting. And most of them that 


I could see had the same mottled light-gray and 
medium-gray texture, and it looked like there's a 


lineation in it. And whatever the mottling is, 


it's on a frame size or fragment size of a -or 


a few centimeters, and it looks as if it's very 
uniform in that mottling; that is, there's one 


one fragment size. 


Okay. 


There are a few near one crater out at 12 o'clock 


dark-gray rock that may be glass coated. Matter 


of fact, one of them looks like it's right at the 


rim and might have been part of a projectile that 


made the crater. 


Roger. 


The large boulder that I mentioned that's several 


meters in diameter -I'm not even sure it's a 


boulder -It does have a well-developed fillet. 
It's highly fractured. It looks like the fractures 
generally are north-south. At least you can't 


we can't see end on into the fractures. And it's 


too far away to be sure, but it looks like it's 


mottled also, although there did appear in the 


bin -in the monocular to be a more heterogeneous 


mottling. It might be a breccia. 


Okay. 


That boulder ought to be very close to the ALSEP 


site. 


Roger.

CDR-LM Gordo, in reference to these boulders, everywhere 
_' I can see out of my left window and out ahead of 
me in referring to that boulder Jack's talking 
about which is just a little bit on my side at 
12 o'clock, it appears that the dark mantle has 
filleted and, for the most part, covered -or it 
has covered part of or is up on top of some of the 
crevices and the crannies in the boulders themselves, 
with the exception of -Well, I'll take 
that back -even the very small ones. I'd say 
from a population point of view, boulders of the 
size Jack's talking about that are visible through 
the surface anywhere from i to 2 to 3 meters -a 
very small percentage, but when you look at them 
at our level, it looks like they are quite populous. 
I'd say there are maybe about 25 of them 
in view between myself and the -where the horizon 
falls off down away from us towards the South 
Massif. The area back towards Station l, at least 
the other side of Trident, looks like it's more 
heavily strewn with some of these filleted and 
partially mantled large fragments. 
CC Roger, Gene. 
L_P-LM To say that there is a boulder, as such, actually 
sitting on the surface, I can't -I really can't 
find one, unless they're along -around something 
very small and possibly younger craters. But I 
think for the most part everything is somewhat 
mantled. 
CC Okay. 
0_ 16 20 _8 LMP-LM Gordy, I think maybe the predictions of a fairly 
thin regolith were good. I have a crater at 
about -oh, 130 feet. It looks like it's not more 
than a meter deep. It's very fresh, has a bright 
halo around it, and it's very rocky in its interior 
and has some rocks that are at least l0 or 20 centimeters 
in diameter on the rim. It looks like 
it's penetrated into some rockier -much rockier 
substrate than what we're seeing on the surface. 
The surface itself looks like a -oh, probably 
15 percent fragments greater than half a centimeter.

that's -maybe a meter in diameter that -fairly 


fresh, although not bright halo -that has not 
penetrated to blocky material. And it looks like 

that the saturation crater size is very small in 


the area we can see; that is, there don't seem to 
be any old or very subdued craters -Well, let me

It's obviously saturated with craters a few centi


meters in diameter, but when you get bigger than

rather than a saturation. 

Okay. 


Gordy, let me give you a quick far horizon. At 
12 o'clock, I've got Family Mountain. It's a-
it and South Massif are a replica from their plane 
form where I -up from where I am, except that 
Fam_ ly Mountain is much more symmetrical and 
rounds off to a very more definite peak. The 
South Massif, in turn, has got a high plateau, a 
high flat peak on top. My far horizon then, at 
12 o'clock, from about -to ll:30 is dominated by 
Family Mountain. It's -Well, I hate to use the 


word anorthosite without getting out of the spacecraft, 
but it sure is white. It sure is white, 
but its varied shades of white -with -sort of a 


a tendency on its southern or southeastern slope 
to sort of be marble caked with a darker material 


much the same color as the mantle that we're -we 'ye 
landed on. The F-m_ly Mountain disappears just 
about at the level of the rim of Camelot on my 


far horizon and just in front of it -it starts 


out -that's at about ll o'clock -it just -Just 
there is where the South Massif starts up very 
abruptly -I'd say -well, I'll try not to overestimate, 
but certainly 30 degrees, I'd say -very 
abruptly to a very impressive altitude. I know 
I was at 13_000 when I said I was at their level, 
but -it sure looked it from there. It -it plateaus 
off from about 10:30 to about 9:30, and then

it starts sloping back down towards the east at 


about the same angle. Very s_mmetrical. There 


are several places where you can see what appear 


to be outcrops. I say several -about a dozen 


anyway, where you can see relatively large areas 


of outcrop on the South Massif. That outcrop is 
a -of a darker gray color than the white-gray of 


the Massif itself. The one most domineering 


dominant outcrop is right at the change in slope 


to the west, where it goes upslope and then pla


teaus off, and there is a definite outcrop. And 


you can see several boulders on all levels of the 


Massif that have come apparently from outcrops 
and I feel certain we will be able to get to some 
of those -that have come all the way down. South 
Massif, too, is a -appears to be in areas marbly 
caked dirty, such as if it was sprinkled with a 
dirty or a darker covering, and that covering is 
more evident as -as it slopes back here towards

I can see -I can see -South Massif all the way

some lineations running -well, as I'm looking at 


them, they're dipping down into the west at about 
20 degrees, but that may be a Sun-a_le problem. 
BUt they're definitely there. And then, contras


ting that is -is Bare Mountain which is also much 
darker gray, much different than the Massif from

Hills to be like. One other thing about the South 
Massif isthat -asIlook at-asIlook atit

very small craters and penetrated the Massif craters 
maybe a meter or 2 in size, some 5 meters, 


and there's a lot of rock debris around them, 
which tends to believe that there is very little, 
if any, soft covering on that Massif. 


Roger. 


Gordy, just a couple more words about the North 
Massif. It looks like a good distribution of 
boulder tracks. Many of the boulders are acces


sible. They are -the tracks can be traced up, at 
least to midslope. That's at my 3 o'clock position. 
And occasionally, at that midslope position, particularly 
northwest of Henson, you can see abundent 
boulders suggestive of outcrop. That's 


something that we had m_ssed seeing on the pre-
mission photos. But -And it isn't as abundant 


as on the South Massif, but there are apparent 


ledge formers about midslope. 


Yes, let's make ... I don't know ... a lot of ...

is a lind of a dark halo-type crater there. Very 
small one. And it doesn't have the appearance of 
a h_,mmocky crater rim to it, at all. It looks 
like the material Just kind of spreads out all 
over the area, but it doesn't have a h_mmocky 
appearance to it. I'm going to take a look at 
that again when I come back -on back around on 
the other side. There's a small mound down in 
the bottom of the crater, also. It's a domical


shaped structure in the bottom of that small crater. 
It's right next to J3. North of J3. 


Roger, Ron. 


Coming in, I can see the landing site, now quite 
well. The appearance of the slide area 
definitely shows up. The South Massif seems to 


have the Sun shining right on the walls. I'm 
looking for any type of layering, or anything 
like that. And can't see anything that -that 
would show that up. The big difference between 
the massif structures and the Sculptured Hills is 
that the massifs look like they are a steeper 


slope. And they -they don't seem to have that 
type of covering over them, like the Sculptured 


Hills do. 


I'm right over now. The scarp definitely cuts up 
through the North Massif. I can't see continuation 
on into the South Massif at all. But, you can 
definitely see a vertical exaggeration as it cuts 
on around up over the North Massif. And it's 


A]most -I'd have to take another look at it for 


sure, but it almost looks like a flow coming from 
Family or in the vicinity -in the direction of 
Family Mountain -but from the direction of Family 
Mountain -lapping up on the side of the North 
Massif. That's the way it looks as you go on by 
it. I couldn't see anything that would lead you 
to believe that the slide area, so to speak, would 
come on across anything that would be the source

that. 


Copy. 


Yes, just like the map shows, and all the pictures, 
you've got a definite demarcation in the annulus 
around Serenitatis here, as you look by Sulpicius 
Gallus area. As you look at it -I'm going to 
have to take another check on it -but the dark 
annulus looks to me like it's raised above the 
mare, proper, itself. I'll check that a little 


more as we come on across. 


You know all those rilles to the north of -I 


mean to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. There is a 


bunch of crisscrossing. One is right on the edge 


of the Serenitatis basin -and I don't remember 


the name of that crater, I'll have to look it up 
later -but they've got slightly raised rims around 
the rilles. You can see some layering down inside 
the rille itself, in the east-west and the one 


that runs in the east-west direction. 


Roger. You're talking about near Menelaus? 


Yes, I'll have to look on the map and see for 


sure what the crater is, but there's an impact 


crater right on the edge of Serenitatis basin 


right on the terminator. Right now. 


Roger. 


And then those rilles are just to the north of 


that crater. 


Roger. That's probably Menelaus -M-e-n-e-l-a-u-s -
Menelaus.

we will not be closing the mapping camera,

CMP Okay. 
CC According to the Flight Plan, you do it at 117:50. 
Right about that time. 
CMP Okay. Will do. 
04 18 48 23 CMP Bob, one little notice. Supplies I had this morning. 
Might made notes, so I wouldn't forget about 
it. It was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes 
a heek of a long time to vent that tunnel. In the 
simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and 
it flips right down and vents. And I was beginning 
to wonder if it -if it was leaking or something. 
CC Roger. 
CMP As it turned out, as it turns out, it worked out 
all right. But I bet it took a good l0 minutes, -
to get up to 3.5. Before I could turn the jets 
back on, you know. 
CC Roger. 
CMP Go, that's ready to go. 
CC Ron, Just one reminder as we go around the horn 
here. The waste water -the way -the position 
it is in will probably take between l0 and 12 minutes 
to dump it completely. Or dump it to your 
l0 percent number. 
CMP Okay, that 's good. Oh, glad I don 't have anybody 
watching for me this time. Do I? 
CC Yes, that's right. We won't be able to call you 
on that. When it's down to 8 percent.

like to make sure you get the H2 purge line heaters

the window earlier or something.

of some kind; it's about l0 or 15 percent vesicles.

Oh, but they always -they always give themto us 
in the simulator. Hey, Bob, judging from what I 
see on my clock, we're not but about 5 minutes 


behind. 


That agrees more or less with the way we read it. 


Gene had a little forward motion as I think you 
heard his call. And that shows up in the forward 
footpad at any rate or did. It looks like he may 


have hit tail first a little bit. That's embedded 


to the full pad depth. I see no -By George, Gene_ 
you may have hadafirst. I think you stroked 
that thing. 


I stroked what? 


The rear -the rear landing gear. 


Well, we can measure it and find out. 


I'll take a picture of it. 


May have stroked it. The Mylar, the lower orange 
Mylar, is folded a little bit. 


Roger. There's word floating around down here 


about a typical Navy landing, but I'm not sure 


whether we believe it or not. 


He caught his tail hook. Say, Bob-


That's the best way. 


--Just behind the LM in that very fresh crater, 


I picked up an example of the kind of gabbro I was 


talking about. And I'll stick it in the big bag, 


except the big bag has disappeared.

you're ready.

think when we get on to Reiner Gam_na on that 
pass of target 15 Delta, we're not going to have 
enough film left to run out over Riccioli and 
that area, which is already taken. That's why we

down in here? 
CDR-EVA What were you doing down in there?

IA{P-EVA 
--Bob, there's a little bit of dust adhering 
to the -sides of the LMS. And a few particles 


less than -half a percent of the surface on the 


top. But, of course, 
you're going to clean that 


one off; 
so that's all right. 


CC 
That's affirm on the top. 


LMP-EVA 
The -the north side has about a -10-or 
15-percent dust cover. 


CC 
Copy that. 


LMP-EVA 
... 


CC 
-And, Geno, you're leaning pretty heavy forward 
on that drill. 


CDR-EVA 
Okay, Bob. She went in -she's going in like she's 


in some pretty dead stuff, and then I hit some 


rock here. I'll watch it -I won't lean forward. 


I'm not putting too much pressure on it. 


CC 
Okay. 


CDR-EVA 
It sounds to me like she's chippering away through 
rock. May be Just a little longer drilling hole 
than it was at the Cape. 


04 20 55 14 CDR-EVA 
Bob, she's going in -but not without a little bit 
of resistance. 


CC 
Roger. We're observing that, Geno. 


CDR-EVA 
Every once in a while -every once in a while, 
she breaks through a soft spot. 


CC 
Good. 


LMP-EVA 'Bob, I'll tell you, this central station's a 
bear -bear to get level. Well, I just got dust 
on it now. 


LMP-EVA 
It's Just too soft. 



Tape 79A/11 
CDR-EVA Boy, that sure was drilling in hard stuff because 
it took a lot to get it off. 
CC Okay, Jack. And we could certainly stand a little 
bit of dust, at least on top of that central station 
sunshield. 
LMP-EVA Yes, I guess the level's important. 
CC Roger. 
CDR-EVA I can just see what John's thinking right now. 
That's what makes the difference. That's where 
you expendyour energy. 
LMP-EVA Bob, I don't know that I'm going to be able to do 
that without a lot of time. It's hanging against 
the south edge. 
CC Say again there, Jack. 
LMP-EVA I don't know whether I'm going to be able to level 
it -the central station. 
CDR-EVA Anything I can do, Jack? 
LMP-EVA Okay. I got it off the edge. 
CC Okay; maybe we better Just leave it there. 
LMA°-EVA Well, I'm making it worse by getting dust on the 
top. 
CC No, the dust on the top is not as important as 
getting it leveled, Jack. But if you get it 
broken off the edge, that ought to be good enough. 
04 20 59 02 CDR-EVA Bob, I'm riding at about 382. I've got -oh, I 
guess, about 80 -Well, no, there's half -I 
guess, 60 percent; no flags and no tones. 
CC Okay. Copy that, Geno. 
04 20 59 24 LMP-EVA Okay, Bob. It's touching the second ring; the 
gnomon is aligned, and I'm going to leave it alone. 
CC Roger on that. 


Tape 79A/12 
IAtP-EVA Yes, I think I lost all the time I might have 
made up. 
CDR-EVA Hey, Bob, it's obvious that I'm going through some 
pretty stuff -tough stuff. Consolidated material, 
like rock fragments, and then it breaks through; 
and then it Jumps for about 3 or 4 inches and then 
I hit some more fragments. 
CC Roger. We're seeing that Geno. Looks interesting. 
LMP-EVA Oh, me. I got too low on that one. I thought I 
had that gaged. 
CDR-EVA If you deploy that geophone, you'll go out of 
sight. 
CDR-EVA Bob, there would be absolutely no way of breaking 
this drill from that -those bores without that 
tool, I guarantee you that. 
CC Okay. We copy that, Geno. 
CDR-EVA I think I found a way to get this off, though, with 
a little help. Okay, number 3 coming up. 
CC Roger. The third and last one on this hole. 
CDR-EVA Yes, sir. Oh, boy. Time out. 
CC Okay. 
LMP-EVA Don't work too hard. 
CC Roger. 
CDR-EVA My fender's still on, which makes me happy. I'll 
tell you, if you could come and sprinkle the whole 
area with water and get rid of some of this dust -
CC Okay, Geno. And can you remember if those heat 
flow cables are not crossed as they come out of that 
box? 
CDR-EVA Yes, sir. I very definitely made a point of them -
not crossing them. 
CC 0kay; very good. 


Tape 79A/13

CC Good. 
LMP-EVA (Laughter) Where do we find such men? 
CDR-EVA How's it coming, Jack? 
LMP-EVA Oh, slow. This leveling is really throwing me 
behind the power curve; but I know they -they're 
serious about it, so -If I can keep it where it 
is now, I'm in like Flynn. It's perfectly centered. 
Even the gnomon is aligned within a shadow 
width. 
CDR-EVA Man, is that thing biting. 
I_P-EVA Really working down there, are you? 
CDR-EVA Oh, you betcha, man. I'm in something tough down 
there now. Whew. 
LMP-EVA Well, what -what bore are you in? 
CDR-EVA Number 3. If I let go of that drill and it kept 
running -If that drill kept running and I wasn't 
anchored to the ground --
LMP-EVA (Laughter) 
CDR-EVA -It would throw me over a massif -in tangential 
turns. 
CC Okay, Geno --
CDR-EVA I think I'm in the mother lode down there. 
CC Gene, if its getting really tough and you're not 
making much progress, we'll be happy with it 
where it is. 
CC Well, looks like you really --
CDR-EVA No, sir, you're going to be happy with it where 
it's supposed to be; and that's where it's --

Yes. 


Okay. Then that sounds good. 


Oh, shucks. Hey, Bob, is there any way a level 
bubble can fail (laughter)? 


Hey, Jack, remember that's on top of those wobbly 
legs and -or wobbly springs there. And with the 
thing not being straight, you shouldn't really 
expect the level bubble to be level after the 
thing's been deployed. That happened at the Cape 
a couple of times, remember? 


Yes, but Bob, I've -I've moved this practically 


all the way down the full throw and it -That 
bubble won't move, and I can't get it to move by 
tilting it; and I was level. And the bubble on 


the top of the central station is still level.

Okay. Let me take a look at my list and see whether 
I've got everything. Measured, measured; height, 
height; you've got all the shields; you're coming 
out south; verify heat flow is level and aligned -
It is aligned and gnomon was good; UHT to the 
LRV LMP seat; and then what do I do? Let me see. 
Deep core prep. Jack, I'm going to leave the UHT 
in the heat flow in case you need it.

CDR-EVA Okay. I'm going to go behind a rock over there -
LMP-EVA Now, now. 
CDR-EVA In that depression. Bob, you do want the core in 
a depression, right? 
CC Roger. That 's affirmative, Geno. 
CDR-EVA Okay, nobody touch my heat flow. That's the 
prettiest Job I've ever done. Okay, I'm going 
behind a boulder over here. Bob, I'ye got about 
385; and, I guess, about 50 percent. I can't see 
it too well.

LMP-EVA Bob, one comment on -getting the geophones within 
a few degrees of vertical -In this undulating 
terrain (chuckle), I think they're pretty good; 
but it's not real easy to tell what vertical is. 
CC Roger, Jack. 
CDR-EVA Well, this is right in line with the shallow 
depression; and it's right in llne with the -
RTG, with a rock in the middle. 
CC Okay, Geno. As long as you're drilling behind the 
rocks from the RTG, that's great. 
CDR-EVA That's where you're going to get it. Let me see 
what I need. Drill, rack, core bag -drill at

CDR-EVA It's a shallow one. If I go over there, I'm not 
shielded, Jack. 
LMP-EVA No, that's good. Get in the middle. Get it in 
that place.

What happened?

Oh, I lost my vise. I see it. Isee it.

Hope I took number 1 in the right direction. 
Yes. Okay, number 4 will be a little hard to 
pick up. 


CDR-EVA 
Boy, all these little craters are filled with glass. 
Come on back here. I've got to chase this thing 
over the lunar surface. 


LMP-EVA 
I've seen glass covers. Oh, about out towards 
there, I guess. 


LMm-EVA 
As I was saying, Bob, all these big blocks that 


I've looked at look like the gabbroic rock that 


I was talking about -possibly upwards of 


50-percent plagioclase rather than 30 like the 


mare -but an intermediate gabbro of some kind. 


And one big block there had very sharply defined 


parallel 
parting planes. I think there is a 


foliation of minerals that parallel that parting, 
but I'll have to check it out. 


04 21 46 08 CC Okay. Copy that, Jack.

CC Yes. Are you --
LMP-EVA Not bad. 
CC Okay. You're not having to worry about the photos 
yet ? 
LMP-EVA No, I've been checking it, Bob, my biggest problem 
is that the flags don't anchor.

there 


Hey, don't do that. 


No, I mean - 
oh, I won't hurt it. It's Just that 


it -it stretches the other geophones tight. 


Okay. Well,

Okay. Don't worry about it. I'll watch it. 


The anchors are completely unsuccessful -on the 


module, anyway.

the vicinity of the original stereo pan; and the 
second one, they suggested, will be to the northwest

rock, it's the fillet. I can't get a chunk of the 


rock. 


Copy; 174, fillet beside the big rock. And, Jack, 


while you coming back here to the Rover, why don't 


you get one more Rover sample in the vicinity of the 


deep drill, while you and Gene get ready to take on 


the core stems. And because of being a little bit 
behind here, what we're doing is, we're getting 


prepared to drop station i in favor od doing Steno. 


Over. And I'll get with you on more details on 


that in a minute. 


Well, how far behind are we? 


Stand by. You're about -between 35 and 40 minutes. 
And part of the problem is that we're a little 


short on oxygen on Gene's PLSS. It looks like it's 


a 6 minute and 4 -6 hours and 45 minute EVA from 
that point of view, which means that we have to we'd 
have to leave station i too early, which is 


another -which is the reason to curtail station 1 


apart from just behind which is what the hooker 
was. 


Okay, Bob, I'm approaching the rear of the Rover. 


I've got the core, the cap, the wrench, and the 


r_mmer.

on going to the west side of Steno and that boulder 
field that's part way out to station 1.

Bob, I did see a dense gray rock that's different 
than the others on my traverse out here. We'll 
try to find some of that, too. 


Okay, Bob, I'm reading 278, 003, and 003 at the 
SEP site. 


Okay. Copy that, Geno. And how about giving me 
amp-hours and batteries just as long as you're 
there? 


Yes, sir, it's coming at you. Amp-hours are ll2 
and ll0; batteries are 9 -92 and about i about 
ll2. 


Okay, copy that, Geno. 
Motors are all off scale low. 


Yes, okay thank you. 
NAV is going to RESET. 
Say again there, Gene. You're going to go to RESET, 


right? 
Yes, sir; going to RESET. 
Okay. Jack, you can be getting on. You won't 


need a bomb, and I guess you won't need the LMP 
camera unless you want it. We'll be deploying the 
bomb at Steno. 


(Laughter) I thought we were playing it by the 
checklist, Geno. Here's the bomb. 
Okay, give it to me. 
The charge. 


I've got it. 
Yes, it Just happens that the station is at the 
place we're going to deploy the charge.

Tape 80A/31 
LMP-EVA Okay, well, we got it off. 
CDR-EVA Okay. Do you know which side of $teno he wants us 
to go, Jack? 
LMP-EVA Not yet. 
CC Yes. We're going -Okay, let me fill you in on 
the plan, guys. We're going to go to the west 
side of Steno, which is where you would have driven 
by anyway, and the stop is -will be at the 340/1.2, 
which is where you've got the little Delta for 
EP 6, in your checklist. And we will plan on 
spending about 30 minutes there sampling primarily 
boulders. 
LMP-EVA Okay, Geno, west side of Steno there. 
CDR-EVA Okay. I got it here. Okay --
LMP-EVA You got a good feeling on how to head out of here? 
CDR-EVA Yes. I want to get around the back side -now that 
I'm down there, on the back side of Trident, and 
make sure that that's what I'm looking at, is 
Trident over there. 
LMAO-EVA Okay, let me try to get on this thing. 
CC Okay. And, 17, Just to fill you in a little bit 
more here. We're looking at a 6 plus 45 EVA. 
We've given you 15 minutes to drive to station l; 
30 minutes at station l; and 15 minutes to drive 
back to the SEP, and then deploying the $EP for 
22 minutes. And then a 40-minute closeout at 
6 plus 45. 
CDR-EVA I'm sorry, Bob. After 30 minutes at station l, 
what did you say? 
CC Okay. Then we're going to drive back. There's a 
15-minute return to the SEP site, and then 22 minutes 
at the SEP site to deploy the SEP, and then 
return to the LM in 45 minutes for the closeout.

has not really changed except slightly more hummocky 
and rolling, because of a larger number of

pyroxene, plagioclase gabbro -the vesicular 
rocks seen at the LM. At least all that I've 
seen so far.

--sure not much news today. It's a good thing 


you guys made the landing today, because there 
wouldn't be any news in the paper tomorrow if it 
wasn't for you all. 


(Laughter) 


Let's see. Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka's 


Liberal Democrats lost 26 seats, but he still has 


a firm hold on the Diet, and Tanaka still has a 
firm maJorityo And Henry Kissinger and 
Le Duc Ttlo's secret Paris peace talks have bogged

down under some academic situations. And -news 
out of Kansas City isn't too good, but President 
Tr_mau is -feeling some irregular heartbeats and 
has reduced the optimism for his recovery. 


Not too good. 


This last one has got to be the height of trivia. 


I'm just going to read it to you exactly the way 
it is. It's from Saigon. Question? What does 


an Air Force enlisted man do when he meets a naked 


general? He salutes. An order issued by Major 


Paul M. Boseman at Tan Son N-hut Air Base makes the 
requirement clear. Salute when you recognize an 
officer, even though you both are nude. An Air 
Force spokesmau said he didn't know under what 
circumstances officers and enlisted personnel 
might encounter -encounter each other in the nude.

That's got to be Trident, Jack, because that's 


too big for anything else. 


Okay, Houston. There's -the classic raindrop 
pattern over this fine debris. I'd say that the 
surface definitely is sorted, the fine regolithic 
material forming one fraction and then the blocks 
another. The blocks are prob -those blocks are 
greater than a -2 centimeters in diameter. In 


general, make up less than l0 percent of the surface.

see that dark mantle over on top of _lmost all the

Okay; you're right. Okay, here we go. I'm 
headed out. 


Okay, Houston. The location is in about the least 
cratered area I could find, between a large crater 
or a large depression that's about -oh, ranges 


from maybe 50 to 150 meters behind the LM. That's 
maybe -south -or east-southeast; and it's between 


that depression and another large depression that 
is really a doublet with a blocky septum between 


them. That's to the northeast of the LM about 


200 meters; that's the start of that second 


depression. I think we can get a nice layout, 
although there'll be a general slope, I believe, 
towards the LM -of about 1 degree. 


Okay, that's no real problem, Jack. No problem, 
Jack. 


Jack, am I about abeam of you? I can't see. 


Yes. 


Okay, I'll turn in around this crater. 


Hey, if you come right 


That depression to the northeast is at least a 
couple hundred meters in diameter, and it's Joined 
with one that's probably of comparable size Just 
to the northwest of the first depression.

Okay, Bob, I guess I'm going to take the TV away 


from you. 


Okay. And, Gene, one thing we'd like before you 
guys leave the Roy -


... 


--one thing we'd like before you guys leave the 
Rover is a fairly good description of what happened 
to the rear fender when it came off. Is the damage 
primarily to the piece that you've lost, or are the 
rails on the pieces remaining fairly bad? 


Okay.

--Romeo. 


Well, a piece of the rail on the -on the aft -aft 
inboard side here -the rail isn't missing -it's 
Just a piece of the flange -the rail that fits 
against the fender -but that doesn't hold any part 


of the fender on. I don't remember what I saw on 


the fender -The rails look pretty good, Bob. And 
I had one of them completely on, and I Just couldn't 
get the other one on. If I had known what that dust 
was, I would have tried an awful lot harder. 


Okay, do you have any feeling that -


I heard John telling me, but -


Do you have any feeling that you could get away 
with putting a front fender on? 


Well, I have done it before, but it's not easy. 


Okay, as far as you can tell, so that we can look 
at it over night, the rear fender -the part that's 
remaining -looks in fairly good shape, right?

we're going to be coming at you with a n_mber of 
items here, not too many, but the first will be 
some surface block data. Then we're going to 
read up to you a LEVA cleaning procedure which is 
fairly simple, a real short geology debrief, a 
one-line change in the Lunar Surface Checklist. 
And then, we've been doing some thinking down here 
about how to fix the fender. And it's going to 
involve, we think, although we'll work on it while 
you guys are getting some rest, it's going to 
involve using utility clamps, from inside your LM 
there, instead of tape, to fasten some sort of 
stiff material onto the Rover in place of the 
missing fender. And we'll go with either with 
one of your -your cue cards, or possibly with 
part of insulation that, was the flame blanket 
protecting the Rover during the landing. Or 
perhaps part of the packing material that was 
between the Rover wheel and is probably lying on 
the ground underneath the LM there.

got in here. Either that or back of a part of a 
data book or something -I hate like the devil to 


tear one of those other fenders off. And the 


reason tape won't stick is that everything's got 
a fine coating of dust, and the only way I could 
finally get it to sti_ was to put tape on it rip 
the tape off -or take the tape off -which 
took some of the dust off and then tape would 
tend to hold it. But it Just won't hack it up 


here. 


Roger, Gene. That's exactly what we're thinking. 
And what we're going to do is run through the fix 
in a pressure suit a few hours from now. And if it 
looks like we can do it, and it won't cost you many 
more than say l0 minutes, we're going to have you 
go through with it. If it takes longer than that, 
we're going to go back to the drawing board and 


see what else 
we can do here. 


Well, you know John and Charlie can tell you Just 
had bad it is. I wouldn't have believed it-I 


guess I didn't believe it, or ! would have worked 
a little harder to make sure that fender was going 
to stay on. But it -Man, Just that short -trip 
back from where we lost it, snd we were Just 
covered. The whole -I couldn't even read the 
parts of the panel on the Rover, plus all the 
battery covers and everything.

Okay, Jack, and for the geology questions. I'm 
going to turn the console over to the well-known 
geologist of the Seifort Galaxies. 


Can't hack it, huh? You've all forgotten everything 
I taught you. 


I draw my sword. 


Okay, guys, you want me to address first those to 
Gene -those to Jack, and then address them to 
Gene later on, or you guys both want to answer them 


at the same time? 


Well, we're both listening. We can answer them. 


Okay, the way you asked that, I wasn't sure. 


Okay. Question number 1 is -concerns the Rover 
mobility rate. The Rover mobility rates over the 
short span you drove, which is hardly representative, 
are slower than people had anticipated. 
Do you think this is due to visibility_ terrain, 
or what? Do you think you can still hack a 7.3 or 
8-kilometer minimum or average to Station 2 
tomorrow? 


The answer to that is yes, Bob. I think it's 
partly -partly faa, but it's also the fact that 
we did a lot of circling. We didn't drive in many 


straight lines. Trying to find, for the most part, 
our bearings, amd tried to pick some high spots 
so we could look around. So I think straight-line 
navigation out in the area we're going is going 
to be easily 8 kilometers. 


0k_y, great. 0kay. Another question here, Gene, 


that you should be able to answer with a simple 
yes or no. Was there any spillage of the material 
in the drill core while y_a were breaking it down? 



f-


Tape 83A/7 
CDR-LM Simple no. 
CC Okay. And --
CDR-I24 Spillage out of it? 
CC --Yes, you know, when you broke the sections, 
did you lose much material out of it? 
CDR-LM No, sir; I didn't lose any. 
CC Okay, next simple question. When you were drilling 
the deep core where the neutron probe was, could 
you see the RTG over the rock? 
CDR-LM Yes. 
CC Okay. You have any feel for how high the rock is 
or how low -how deep the thing was with respect 
to the -with respect to the RTG? Where you down 
in a level that was below, even without the rocks 
being there? 
05 03 48 l0 CDR-LM Yes, I think I -yes. I was in a -in a slump. 
There was a ridge between us and the RTG, and I 
had the rock in a line of sight between it and 
where I put that core. And I'd say the rock was 
certainly near the ridge and it was -what, Jack? -
I don't know was it meter to -meter high for the 
most part. And it sloped off, and I'd say at 
least a half a meter high in the line of sight 
from where the neutron probe is to the -to the 
RTG. Plus, there's a lot of undulations -I think 
it 'll be below the line of sight, anyway. 
CC Okay. And a somewhat more general question, here. 
It says -and I'll read it. We're still puzzled 
as to whether there is a dark mantle. Could you 
say something more about the dark regolith surface? 
There's a lot of discussion, today, about whether 
or not it could have been a regolith derived from 
the intermediate gabbro which you were sampling 
as boulders.

Bob, I -I think I don't have too much to add to 
what I said, near the end of the EVA, is that I 


do not have an intuitive feeling that the regolith 
has been derived from most of the boulders that 
we're seeing. But -because those boulders are 


fairly light-colored, they look like they're 
probably 50 percent plagioclase. The -it could 
be that the regollth is derived from some other 
material that has blanketed the area. I don't 


think we have that answer, yet. 


Okay. I copy that. 


Bob, the boulders -the boulders we are sampling I

feel we sampled the subfloor because we saw 


on the sides of the craters where some of these 


boulders were exposed _lmost as if theywere 


bedrock down there. In driving back from what we 


called Station l, we -we could definitely see the 


light mantle out in the area where the potentials 


of aslide are. 


Okay, very good. Yes, I think that the -At least, 


it's a going bet around here that we're sampling 


the subfloor when we're sampling -at least the 
top of the subfloor when we're sampling the 


intermediate gabbro there. The rocks and the 


boulders.

It is sort of strange that we don't see a good

Tape 8BA/9 
they're considerably coarser than comparable -
well, they're about the grain size of some of the 
coarse-_ain Mare basalts that tend to differentiate 
the crystallobalite and trid_mite -but we 
didn't see any of the finer-grain versions. If 
it's an intermediate crystalline rock, we have not 
seen any fine-grain equivalents yet. At least not 
in abundance. 
CC Okay, I copy that. 
CC We get -we gather that there's no color change in 
the dark-mantle material at depth. In other words, 
the footprints, wheel tracks, and the rake sample,

On the -%he outcrops you think you see in the 
North and South Massifs, do they appear to be 
linear horizontal, or subhorizontal? Can you see 
ls_vers, and do you have any feel for the thickness 
or the attitude or the continuity of them? Can you 


discuss these outcrops? 


Bob, the -gQi_ugpver yesterday, I thought I could 
see a -a structure dipping off to the southeast, 


apparent dip anyway, on the eastern side of the 


South Massif. Or northeastern side. We haven't 


exAmi_ed them in detail because we were in a rush 
to get out. We' 11 put the binoculars on them and 
try to ex-_ue that question. There's nothing 
very obvious, any more than you can see on the 


photos, that the ledges were concentrated in the 
upper portion (cough) -excuse me -in the upper 
portion of the Massif's units. 


Okay. We copy that. Here's a short one that I'll 


ask Jack since he did it. Again I guess we'll 
have to prove this -the shade portion of the 


cosmic ray experiment. The question is, and I 
repeat -I quote -"Are you sure that the

CC Okay, the next question which calls for a little 
bit of discussion is: The layers of lineaments 
that you remarked on in the Sculptured Hills, can 
you say anything about them? 
CDR-LM Yes, Bob, I did. I think I said -and I commented, 
I'm not sure whether it was the Sun angle or not, 
but see, I was not looking at the Sculptured Hills. 
I was looking back at Bare Mount_, I believe. 
And, to me it looked like there was some organization 
that was dipping back to the east, somewhere 
between, oh, 20 and 25 degrees maybe. And it was 
very obvious to me but I'm a little -a little 
hesitant because of some of this Sun-angle stuff. 
CC Okay, I copy that. I gather we didn't get any 
500-millimeters of these lineations, that right? 
_-_ CDR-LM No, but I think we will. I -they were on the

You're right. You're right, there was a large 


zap pit in a boulder that was very white. It mast 
have been -the crater for the zap mst have been 
2 centimeters diam-ter anyway. And it had about 
that, or maybe S-centimeters worth of crushed 
minerals around it, that gave it a white, very 
bright white appearance. 


Okay. Well that was indeed a sm_ll crater, so I 
guess the question was right. 


Let me change the mode here and ask you three or 
four simple _LqEP questions again, to verify for 
various people, exactly what happened. Just to 
make sure that they're clear on it. When -Jack, 
when you were laying out the geophone leads, you 
mentioned and asked me if it was all right if the 
geophone leads crossed one another, if there was 
EMI problems. And so that made people wonder 
whether or not it was possible the geophone 
positions were reversed; i.e., geophone i was laid 
out in geophone 2s' direction, et cetera. 


No, that was Just a geophone _ problem. The 
geophones are in the right directions. 


Okay. 


Geophone 4 fell out of the module and rolled under 
one of the other lines, or vice versa, I don't 
know which, and it was -it's crossing one of the 
other lines, geophone l, I think. 


Okay, no problem. Was the -When you went to put 


the LSPE antenna in the heat-flow socket, you 


didn't have -weren't able to do it at first, was 


it because of there was a lot of dust in there? 


No, I think it was the same old problem of that 


piece of -of al_m_num foil or whatever it is 


going down in the socket and Jammtng briefly. 



Tape 83A/13 
CC Okay, I copy that. Did you clear out that foil 
when you did it, or did you Just push it on 
through? 
LMP-LM I pushed it. 
CC Okay. When you taped the SEP solar cells down, 
did you -how much of them did you cover with 
tape? 
LMP-LM We taped the back. 
CC Ah, very good thinking. And, Geno, a question for 
you on the Rover when you parked it. Do you have 
any feeling for the roll angle it was parked at 
,/ the I247 The roll angle? 
CDR-LM Here let me look. Bob, it's pretty flat. If I 
had to guess, Itd say zero. And you can bias that 
· by a degree or so, but basically zero. 
CC Okay, is the pitch scale still on it, or did it 
fall off yet? 
CDR-LM No. I was going to comment on that. It's still 
there. 
CC Okay, very good. Okay, when you went to 
Station· lA, we're calling the new Station i -
Station lA, were the blocks there as well-filleted 
as those near the I_ and the ALSEP? Do they all 
look the same? 
CDR-LM Bob, they -All the boulders had filleting to a 
slight degree, but not au extreme amount. I think 
it no more than what is being caused by the 
redistribution of the darker, fine-grained regolith.

Yes that the fillet -boulders are filleted over 
there about like they are over here. That would 
be my impression. 


Ail right. Is there any indication that the 


fillets are directional, in other words, that the 


fillets are heavier on one side than the other? 


Bob, haven't noticed that. 


Okay, I copy that. Do you have the feeling that 
some boulders are more rounded -' 


Well that's a good --that's a good 


Roger. I agree with that. 


That's a good re -that's a good reminder, Bob. 


Okay, do have any feeling that some boulders are 
more rounded than others? Apparently this looked 
this way in some of the TV pictures ° 


Some of the big ones that are Just barely expose_ 


above the regolith looked quite well-rounded. 
Most of those around the craters are subangular. 
I think -I got the impression that it's Just 
purely a function of how long the same material's 
been exposed; but some of the big boulders like 
the one out near the geophones is quite angular 
in part and quite rounded on other parts. It's 
quite variable. 


Okay, do you want to say any more about that 


boulder? Did it seem to have more or less the 


sa_ morphology, in addition to the variation in 


vesicle size that the other rocks in the vicinity 


of the ALSEP, and the other rocks out at Station 1 


had? 


It's very comparable to the ones that we saw at 


Station l, as a matter of fact. 



Tape 8_/15 
CC Okay, I copy that. 
CDR-L_4 Both types of rocks were there, both variations. 
CC Do you have a feeling for where the big blocks in 
the LM ALSEP area came from? Do you think they 
were from Camelot, like I've been saying? 
LMP-LM Don't have an idea yet_ I'm really not sure. 
CC Okay, and as you drove along on the traverse from 
the SEP to Station l_ did the size of the small 
craters with blocky rims vary? In other words, 
what we are looking for here is the variation in 
the thickness of the ds_k E_ntle? 
LMP-I_M I can't answer that one yet, Bob_ 
CC Okay. Let me sum up by saying, that I guess as I 
indicated before, our best guess is that the 
vesicular crystalline rock, probably gabbro, or I 
think you've been calling it intermediate basalt 
or gabbro, forms at least the upper part of the 
subfloor. I don't think we've been close enough 
to a large crater rim to say that it's a -what 
the deep sections of the subfloor form, but we 
think that this intermediate gabbro vesicular 
rock, at least medi_-grained, perhaps coarse-
grained rock, forms at least the upper lsyer of the 
subfloor. Over. 
LMP-LM Yes, Bob, I think that's pretty safe, right now. 
Once again, I'm surprised that it's _ coarse as 
it is, that being the upper portion of a plains 
unit.

it did. We had one funny reading back at the LM

that everything seems to have gone very well. The

That's got it. And I've got a LEVA-cleaning 
procedure which maybe you could pencil in there. 
It's an easy three-step procedure. And I'll go 
ahead and read it step-by-step here. Step number 
i is tap LEVA base to remove loose dust. 
Step number 2 reads: If excess dust still remains, 
use a towel from the LM tissue dispenser, 
which has been wetted with water, and gently 
wipe the visor from the top to the bottom; that 
is, in one direction. And fold this towel after 
each wipe to keep the contact surface clean. 


There's a note. "Take care not to wet the inside 


that is, the concave surface of the gold visor." 
And the last step is: Allow it to air-dry. And 
that's it on the LEVA cleaaing.

SIM bay's cooking along beautifully. We are 
getting lunar sounder data. It looks quite 
interesting. We've only got one or two annoying 
problems, but nothing major, that is with the 
SIM bay, not with the sounder. One of them being 
that we have our usual mapping camera extend 
problem. And we've just decided to leave it extended 
and it will serve it right if it gets a 
little contaminated with an occasional dump. And _ 


Tape 84A/4 
I guess there's a minor problem with one of the 
big antennas. It didn't pass its retract check 
properly, so I guess it may have to be Jettisoned 
when we do a plane change. Otherwise, things are 
working beautifully. Over.

Okay, Jack and Gene. And, unless you've got 


questions, or we can help you out in some way, 


we'll say good night to you. 


Good morning. 


The reason I say that, Joe, it's going to be 


another 30 minutes or so anyway before we probably 
more like an hour before we actually 


close our eyes. 


Roger, Gene. You think you'll be able to use 


about 30 more minutes of sleep tomorrow morning? 


What's your wish on that? 


Yes, I'd like to try to get the full amount. As 


I recall, tomorrow's a little bit flexible. If 


we get up 30 minutes late, it doesn't really 


hurt us. 


Sounds like a good way to proceed. We'll give 


you the full 8 hours. Good night, Geno. And, 
you do have a time pad in there, so it shouldn't 
hurt a thing. 


Yes, as long -the big object tomorrow is to get 
out, and get back in, and the same thing with the 
next day. I don't think we're really that time 


critical either day that we can't go an hour 
either way. And I think we'd prefer to have the 
full 8 tonight. 


Roger. We couldn't agree with you more. And if 
there's anyway we can be helping you now, Just 


speak up. 


No, you've been doing -doing fine. We just got 
a little housecleaning we got to do that's going 
to take us -I expect we'll be an hour late, Joe. 

Hey, Joe. 
Go ahead.

LMP-LM Some ambiguity in your statement. You want us 
to use a tissue or a towel on that visor cleaning? 
CC Jack, they call it -they call it a towel, but it 
comes from the LM tissue dispenser, so I would 
interpret that to mean tissue. 
LMP-LM Well, you and I are thinking alike. But can you 
ask back there and find out? 
CC Asking right now. 
CC Jack, our guess was right on the cleaning of the 
visors there. We're to use a tissue from the LM 
tissue dispenser. And I've got an unrelated 
question for you. We're tracing water usage down 
here. Could you tell us, please, if you filled 
your drink dispensers -refilled the drink dispensers 
in the suit already? Over. 
LMP-LM That's affirm. We have.

I don't think there's much more than 30 percent

All it means is that we don't yet know the origin

That rock -looks I may have, by accident, sampled 
the front side of one of the parting planes that 
I mentioned. Very, very sharply bounded on one 


side by a planar surface. 


Roger, Jack. Say again. You may have sampled by 
accident the side -the side of what? 


No, I didn't. I mentioned when I sampled it, it 
had one very planar surface, and looking at it 
more closely, it looks like one of those parting 
planes that I talked about even earlier in the EVA.

missing your weather report and wonder what the 
weather is on the Moon right now. 
LMP-LM Well, the Moon's weather is clear and sunny. It's 
only scattered clouds, and all of those seem to 
be attached to the Earth. 
CC Except for a cloud of dust around the right rear 
wheel of the Rover, we've noticed. 
LMP-LM Yes, but dissipates in the morning warmth. Believe 
it or not, Joe, I'm going to be off the air briefly.

a Sl,mmary of 
the report 
CMP Sure. Go ahead, Gordo; Appreciate it. 
CC Okay. I'll read a few selected excerpts here. 
The surface around the landing site is generally 
an undulating plain, which was somewhat rougher 
and had a greater abundance of blocks than was 
expected by the astronauts. It is saturated with 
small craters not exceeding a few centimeters in 
size but not with larger craters. Sma]l craters 
commonly have glass on their floors. Boulders 
ranging from about 1/2 meter to 4 meters are 
common. All of them are partially buried or 
covered with the dust of the dark mantle. In one 
_ 
locality, a crater of about i meter deep pentrated 
the relatively fine dark surface material and 
excavated sv,all blocks. Other shallower craters 


Tape 86B/4 

in this area did not fully penetrate the mantle. 
This fact, together with the abundance of small 
boulders on and near the surface, indicates that 
the dark ms_tle is relatively thin. A minor 
amount of dust noted upon landing suggested a 
thin layer of fine grain unconsolidated material. 
Footprints and LRV tracks left firm impressions 
in the fine grain material when darker material 
was kicked up from underneath. At the ALSEP site, 


the drill encountered harder material several times 


and definitely seem to reach harder material at 
about a 7-foot depth. The deep drill core 
apparently also bottomed in harder material. In 
the core, the material was noted to be cohesive, 
and it contained more fragments than did the 
surficial material. Predominant rock type between 
the LM and Steno Crater is medium grained, 
vesicular or nonvesicular basalts or gabbro. They 
contain about equal amounts of plagioclase and 
pyroxene along with less abundant opaque material. 
The guys took a total of -well, they took a lot 
of pictures. They had 229 color and 197 blackand-
white during EVA-1. And they got 17 samples 
in addition to the deep drill core. Three were 
large, unbagged rocks, and the total, excluding 
the core, estimated to weigh about 13 kilograms 
so far, and they traveled about B kilometers in 
the Rover. As a suw_ary conclusion, the observations 
made on the first EVA support the premission 
interpretation that at least the upper part of 


the subfloor ms_erials consist of basaltic lava 


flow. The overlying dark mantle maybe part of the 
regolith on subfloor material, but the possibility 
that it is an independent unit re_ns open and 
will be tested by observations on second and third 
EVAs. Both the dark mantle and upper subffloor 
units contain remarkably little foreign material 
between the ALSEP site and Steno with suggests 


comparatively young ages. Over.

get a free moment. 


Okay. I'm just kind of looking out the window now, 
Gordo. Go ahead. 


Okay. According to our rather crude read-out on 
film remaining, it looks like we're using more 
film than we should be in the recorder, and it's 
-if you add up the amount of film used according 
to that telemetry compared to some times 
when the RECORDER has been ON and also in STANDBY, 
it looks like there's a possibility they Jive to 
show that we might be pulling film through the 


RECORDER in-while we're in STANDBY. This is 


unlikely because it takes a couple of failures 
that we don't think are really likely at. all, but 
we're going to try to run a little test at 134:50, 
during that sequence of getting set up with the 
VHF sounder pass.

CC Roger. Go ahead. 
CMP But you get the same vertical -you get the same 
vertical streaking that we do on the edge of 
Serenitatis, off in the Massif units. 
CC Roger. 
CMP Coming up at Picard now. Looking at it -a 
little bit from a distance, there's a darker 
albedo that goes about a half a crater in diameter 
from it. And then, on top of that darker 
albedo -It only goes out maybe a fourth of a 
crater diameter -there's a lighter type material 
-that seems to be covering it up. The lighter 
type material though only goes in a generally 
westerly -well, from the south around to the 
west side and then kind of from the northeast 
around to the northwest side, and it leaves the 
dark material draping down in the side of Picard 
on the east side of Picard. 
CC Roger. 


Tape 88B/2 
CMP It looks like it's a -fairly easy to -When you 
go around the south to the west side, it has a 
light material on it. You can pretty well carry 
a light layer in the top portion of the wall all 
the way around to that -that part where it stops 
-where the light part stops. And then you come 
to a dark layer again -and then -as you continue 
around from the west to go on around to the 
north side. It's a little bit in shadow on the 
east side, so I can't tell for sure whether that 
light layer's in there or not. But starting on 
the south side, boing around to the west again, 
you can see a layer of dark -dark material, 
although it -there doesn't seem to be a change 
in the slope -in the slope or the inner wall 
of the crater. 
CC Okay. 
CMP And then just below -just below the dark layer, 
again a change in slope a little bit. It 
maintains that a slope throughout the -all the 
way down to the crater floor, where you get into 
the slump blocks. And then in the center of the 
crater, it looks like a maria-type film with -
Yes, I'm about to lose sight of it again, but 
with something comparable to a central peak in 
it. And I'll have to get the rest of that a 
little bit later on. 
CC Roger. 
CMP You know right west of -I think it's Yerkes 
or Yerkes or whatever it is -between there and 
Proclus, there's a real small crater I'm looking 
at with the binocs. And the reason it stands 
out is because it's a fresh -fresh crater and 
yet it's a dark -dark halo all the way around it. 
CC Roger. 
CMP And it's also dark down on the inside of it. I 
still don't have a feeling for the relative size 
cf things. I'll try to get that one in the next 
-next pass around through here. But that's what 
I would call a small, maybe even in the -thousand-
meter bracket. Probably somewhere in there.

And as I look at the landing site and the alheSo 
-differences in the color in there -the color 
in the Maraldi G_mma is the same as in the landing 
site itself. And, also, it looks like the 
type of material that we say is essentially covering 
the whole area -goes on out to and includes 
_he annulus of Serenitatis.

Roger. 


Let's see. Did I mention that -that it looks 


like -the flow out of Maraldi has gone on around 
it and down to, and almost encroaches on the 
Vitruvius A. But, it's breached out of the side 
of Maraldi. Gone around that depression and up 


to the side of Vitruvius A. 


Roger, Ron. 


You still get that same bluish -bluish-type 
tint from the area in the landing site. At 
station number 2, on the landslide -it's going 
to be a pretty good -pretty good little depression 
there. The scarp itself -it looks like they 
had picked the least-slope portion to go up it. 
And, that's kind of between Lara -I think Lara's 
the one, right -the crater just to the west of 
the scarp. 


Roger. I haven't been on all your revs. 
You ever had any -anything you'd call a visual 
on the I_? 


No, I really haven't looked that much, Gordo. 
See, my optics are always pointing up in the air; 


so I can't use the sextant. The binocs -I'm 
having a heck of a time holding them still 
enough to -to concentrate on anything very small. 


Roger. 


Oh, when we're coming around the dark annulus, 
follow it around, by Menelaus and Tacquet, and 
then -it kind of changes -seems to change colors 
a little bit when we get up to the Sulpicius 


Gallus. 


Roger. 


I guess the only thing you can say is that -the 
southern part there, in the Tacquet region, has a 
more of a bluish tint. And, then to me, this has 
more of a brownish tint to it when you get to the 
Sulpicius Gallus region. 



Tape _8B/5 
CC Roger. 
CMP Hey, wait a minute. I'm just now passing Menelaus 
now. So, it changes color right at the -Tacquet 
and then -at about Tacquet and Menelaus. 
Sulpicius Gallus is just now coming up. 
CMP You know, I think Sun angle has got a heck of a 
lot to do with that, because this whole thing -

some words, "When maneuver complete, wait 20

LMP-LM Okay, Gordy. Status report is excellent. No 
medication for either one of us. CDR slept 
6 hours pretty good; I slept 6 hours intermittent, 
but generally good. 
CC Okay, Jack. 
LMP-LM And we've eaten well, I think. The food's a little 
bit confused since we had our little -minor explosion 
in the cabin, but -I think you can Just 
say it's good. We've had a lot to drink, a lot of 
juices. We ate the frankfurters. We're sharing 
a lot of the stuff because it's not symmetrically 
packed. If you want more details, it will take

CC Yes; okay. That'll be fine. My mistake. 
CDR-LM Hey, Gordy, on this water. We saturated ourselves 
before we went out. I finished my drink bag out 
in the suit on the surface. Jack finished about 
better than three-quarters of his. We've had 
water and tea and then the juice, and we have been 
drinking water constantly -post-EVA. And to give 
you a quantity is almost impossible. 
CC Okay; that's fine. 
CDR-LM If the water is down, it's probably because we've 
been drinking it. And I'm ready for your lift-off 
pad data.

Okay; I'll now turn the microphone over to 
Captain Young. 


Hey, Geno. This is John. Me spent -


Hello, John. How you doing? 


Oh, just fine. You guys are doing a superb job; 
really beautiful. Hey, we spent some time on 


this -fender problem and worked out a pretty 


simple-minded procedure, which involves essentially 


taking four of those chronopaque pages out of your 


lunar surface map, ones which are not going to 
be used for discussing the site, taping them to


gether with gray -gray tape so that you end up 
with a piece of paper about 15 inches by 


10-1/2 inches, and then using the AOT lamp clamp_ 


preposition them full opened, and taking them out, 
and taking that piece of paper out, laying it on 


top of the fender guide rails and -and clamping 


the edges of it with the AOT lamp clamps. It's 


simple and straightforward, and the beauty of it 


is you're only spending about 2 minutes in the 


clamping operation, and it could save you up to 


about 12 dusting, I think maybe. What do you 


think? 


Yes, John. I -I -I think we ought to try some


thing because you told me, but I -I guess you 


can't appreciate it until you see it happen your


self. That -that dust without that -that fender 


is just almost unacceptable. It -this sounds 


pretty good. How do you want those things taped 


together? 


You just take four pages and allow -Well, I've 


got the detailed procedures here, if you're ready 


to copy. Over. 



Tape 90A/6 
CDR-_ Well, no. I'm not ready to copy yet, but what do 
you do? Tape the four squares into a bigger square 
about 16 by 20. 
MCC Yes. Allow about an inch of overlap, and tape 
both sides of them. 
CDR-LM Okay. 
MCC And then you get the AOT clamps off the utility 
lights and open the clamp Jaws to max. And you 
stow the clamps, and you roll up the paper -roll 
up the -roll up your fender shortwise and put a 
gray tab over that and stow it in the ETB. You 
got both the clamps and the paper fender in the 
ETB. And then when you get out to the Rover, you 
lay the edge of your fender over the inboard guide 
rail and clamp it, and then you lay the other edge 
of the sheet over the outboard rail and clamp it. 
And the only thing you're -really have to worry 
about is making sure that the inboard clamp is 
right over the shock strut so that you don't get 
any interference with the LRV structure when you 
turn the wheel. 
CDR-LM Yes, that's the type of thing I was going to ask 
about, some of those subtle points. There -there 
really should be quite sways -Well, I'll look at 
it -but almost vertical over the hub. Right? 
MCC Yes, on the inboard one. On the inboard one. On 
the outboard one, if you put it a little further 
back aft on the wheel: it -it allows you to -it 
allows you to give your paper fender a little more 
rigidity. 
05 lk 44 10 CDR-LM And you just say lay them over the guide rails, 
so the clamps -put the clamps -so the clamps are 
also over the guide rails. They're not trying -
align that -the makeshift fender in the guide 
rails itself, huh? 
MCC No, it -Just clamp the thing right to the rails. 
Just allow a little overlap, and clamp that rascal 
right down. And I know you can tighten those clamps 
down so good it'll never get loose. I know -I 
know you can do it if I can do it. 


Tape 90A/7 
CDR-LM Okay, John. I think I know what you're talking 
about, and I'd sure like to give it a stab. The 
only hooker is I hope that tape holds the fenders 
together well enough --
MCC Yes, they --
CDR-LM --the pieces together well enough. 
MCC Roger. One of the things -when you're taping 
the -the pages together that you want to be careful 
of is that you -is that you make sure and 
get the air bubbles out so when you get in a vacaum, 
it doesn't open up by itself. And maybe you 
can put an X across there to -to make sure that 
you -if you get any separation -that's it's 
still held together pretty good. We think the 
tape will work --
CDR-LM Okay. 
MCC --think the tape will work because back about 
in 13, we were using it Just sort of incidentally 
in the thermal vacuum chamber, and it worked okay 
there for some reason. 
CDR-LM It would seem to stick 
could find a dust-free 
fender on earlier. 
on the surface okay if I 
spot when I put that other 
MCC Yes, I agreed. 
CDR-_4 As far as -as far as how much of the new fender 
to overlap on the present fender, Just make it 
about symmetrical with the other side, and that 
probably ought to give me plenty of overlap, huh? 
MCC Well, if you -are you talking about over the 
dovetail part of it, or are you talking about 
the aft end of the -of the vehicle? 
off 
CDR-LM I'm talking about -about the present fender that's 
on there, the aft end of that fender. About how 
much overlap do you want with this makeshift 
fender? Just give me an idea. I think I could 
figure out when Z get there, but I'd rather have 
your feelings before I do.

We think if you get it out about 4 inches past 
that fender -You understand what this looks like 
when you get it put on the fender. It Just looks 
like sort of a roll, and you end up with a sort 
of a straight fender right at the back end of the of 
the -of the Rover -a sort of a straight about 
half a pipe straight out there. And, if 
you get it out _ or 5 inches, that will keep the 
dust from coming back over the vehicle. 


Yes, that would be about where I want it. That 
would be about 4 or 5 inches. 


Yes, it's just sort of like a -a horizontal 
fender, like on a -a old automobile. 


I thought I understood what he was talking about. 


Say again, Geno. 


Hey, John. This is Jack. Did you say pipe there 
a minute ago? P-i-p-e?

Okay. As you might have expected, front pages 
around the country are headlining last night's 
EVA with photographs taken from TV monitors show


ing you and Jack going about your tasks. I might 


add that the TV camera is really spectacular. It 
couldn't have been a clearer or more beautiful 
picture, both for fidelity and color. In other 
news, South Vietnam's President Thieu has suggested 
that all prisoners of war be released before 
Christmas. He has also asked that all Vietnamese 
parties be included in peace negotiations. South 
Vietnam and the Viet Cong are now not directly represented 
in the secret talks now under way in Paris. 


Meanwhile, Kissinger met for more than 4 hours yesterday 
with Hanoi representative Le Duc Tho. The 


two negotiators are expected to meet again this 
afternoon. The former President, Harry Truman, is 
still resting quietly, although his condition re


mains serious according to his doctors. American 


poet Mark van Doren died at the age of 78. He was 
a professor of literature at Columbia and a winner 
of the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for his poetry. Presi


dent Nixon announced yesterday that he wants to 
extend price controls beyond the scheduled April 30 
expiration date. He also plans to freeze new hiring, 


promotions, and pay increases for executives of 
the Federal Government, which doesn't affect us, 
I guess. The Republican National Committee has a 
new chairman.

LMP-LM Oh .... 
05 15 09 50 _P-L_4 Hey, Gordo, we're still eating, but let me give 
you a few observations. That outcrop I talked 
about that was way at the top of the South Massif 
at the break in slope -at the very top of the 
break in slope -almost looks -it's hard to tell 
that it's inplace outcrop up there. It's hard to 
convince myself that it is. Looks like there's 
some very large and many, many small fragments of 
large -like 3and 
4-meter rocks up there and a 
lot of smaller fragments. I've seen that type of 
of thing in a number of places over the South 
Massif. However, I -do see -they also, they all 
seem to be sitting on top of the South Massif surface, 
but I do see one other area that it looks 
like there is a -it is protruding from within 
some sort of mantle on the South Massif. So 
conceivably some of that could be a place [?] 
An additional impression I got is -is that at 
least with the monocular, that those fragments -
those boulders look much more angular than what 
we've seen here. And, for the most part, they 
appear to be -if covered at all -very little 
by any mantle except the one I just mentioned. 
CC Okay. Copy that. 
LMP-LM And, Gordy, through the monocular, in contrast 
to the tan gray of the South Massif, those large 
blocks up there look blue -very distinctly 
blue-gray. Not unlike Gene mentioned yesterday, 
anorthosite -anorthosites look in certain terrestrial 
environments. 
CC Roger, Jack. 
CDR-LM And, Gordy, now that i get my -my three-dimensional 
eyeballs working, I can look up on the scarp -out 
to 9 and lO o'clock. It's practically the same 
color as the South Massif. It just looks to be 
very undulating. I see no outcrop evidenced from 
here in the scarp, i think I can just about see 
_lere Hole-in-the-Wall is, but it's so subtle that 


Tape 91A/7 
I can't really tell you much about it. And the 
local terrains which I think is the southern rim 
of Camelot, just about blanks out where Hole-inthe-
Wall should be -just about covers it up. But 
what I can see in a small little saddle to our 
local horizon here in front of us -I can see out 
there just about -oh, I'd say a 100 meters or so 
to the south of Hole-in-the-Wall and it just looks 
like a subtle undulating slope. We can't really 
tell too much the steepness from here. 
CC Okay, Geno, we're -Stand by 1.

One quick thought about the gravimeter. And I'm

During the CF squared we asked about that bundle

when I deployed it, that bundle was -it still had 
contact with the gimbal and everybody at the CF 
squared said that was okay. But, you might think 


about it. I don't know what i could do to help if 
that is the problem. But that might be causing 
the problem here that it wouldn't cause on Earth.

LM_-LM Okay, Bob_ I didn't realize that things were getting

any changes where I don't need to get a charge in 
my hands -that's an awfully good thing to call, 
because not only does it tire your heart -your 
hands out holding it, but it me_ls you don't get 
as many pictures or Rover sam_les or anything else. 
05 15 33 54 CC Roger. You guys are just ahead of us there. We 
were trying to get that up to you. Okay. No, I 
don't think there is anything here that really 
needs to be written down. i'll go through with 
you first, and we can talk about details and 
writing in, if you w_ut to on any of them. But, 
I don't think there is anything that really needs 
to be written in. The EVA -it is going to be 
essentially nominal_ with two minor exoeptions. 
One is the -we've allowed about 5 minutes extra 
at the LM before leaving for the Rover fender fix; 
and, John, we_il be talking to you _out that in 
a minute. _d the second big change, Js that we're 
also extend -allowing 5 more minutes at the end 


Tape 9lA/10 


05153524 CC 


05153553 CC 


of the EVA so that we can have extra time for 


dusting. And I suspect that if the Rover fender 


fix works and we aren't getting as dirty as we 


did last night, then we may gain back that 5 


minutes. We're also allowed -well, what we've 


done is we've taken the time here out of some of 


the tasks at station 3 and station 4. And along 


with the fact that we think you're a little bit 


farther east than planned -and we're allowing 


4 minutes additional driving time. But again, 


that's ali_ real timed and if we're doing well on 


time_ we can reinstitute all those tasks and get 


rid of the 5 minutes that we are allowing here, 


there, or elsewhere. So that's just sort of to 


keep in your thinking. 


There is a possibility that we'll have some addi


tional overhead at each stop, depending on what 


the Rover battery temperatures are when you get 


out this morning_ If the Rover -if they're high 


again, then we'll have to probably park at least 


on some of the stops, if not all -with the up-Sun 


heading and dusting the battery covers and then 


opening them to let them cool. But, again, that 


will depend upon _hat we find on the Rover bat


teries whe_ we get out this morning. 


The variations that we found on the surface of the 


South Massif indicating a possibility of layering 


-! guess you saw those mostly with the monocular 


and the observation of boulder tracks and the size 


of the Massif emphasizes the importance of sampling 


boulders that can be traced to sources at various 


elevations of the Massif. And I guess we should 


say that's hopefully. And we'll just have to see 


what happens when we get down to station 2 on that. 


But_ if we see boulders with tracks: i'm sure you 


guys remember that they obviously will have a 


higher priority. Since we didn't get to Emory, 


and since we didn't really get to the rim of Steno 


itself, the question of sampling of the actual 


subfloor is still somewhat ambiguous although 


there is a large consensus opinion that says that 
we sampled the subfloor when we sampled _hat intermediate 
Gabbro tha_ we sampled yesterday ay both 


the ALSEP and station I_ The -here is a possible 


alternative conclusion which says %hat the subfioor 



05153730 CC 


CDR-LM 
CC 


Tape 9lA/11 


has not been sampled, but that these blocks that 


we sampled and the surface are both parts of a 


later flow. And, in that line, we're still look


ing for specific observations which will help us 


distinguish between whether or not the dark mantle 


is a -whether the dark mantle is a separate unit 


from the intermediate gabbro that we're seeing or, 


whether it's the -Stand by. 


Okay. Whether or not the dark mantle is an entirely 


separate unit from the intermediate gabbro you were 


sampling yesterday or whether it just represents 


the top of very well churned up layer of a flow 


that was later than the subfloor -if you see what 


I'm saying there. Ail this says is that we're 


very interested, of course now -


Roger, Bob. 


-Ail this says that, we're very much more interested 
in station 5, as you might expect, than we were 


before. And I guess, for this reason, we'll be 


trying to keep the time line a little tighter than 


usual to guarantee that we've got some time left 


over at station 5. And, we're also interested in 
moving perhaps -in perhaps moving station 5 from 
its present location there in the southwest of 
Camelot over to the southeast or east or some 
location where we have a feeling that we've got 
big boulders up on the rim. This would be so we 
could sample, hopefully, some of the light material 
and some of the boulders together and get a better 


confirmation that the materials from deep in the 


subfloor unit is this intermediate Gabbro, as 


opposed to just material from the upper part of 
the subfloor. It's just a matter of proving to 


ourselves whether Or not the boulders we sampled 
yesterday are from deep within the subfloor, or 
only at the surface of the subfloor; or, perhaps, 


as I said, the other alternative being that the 


intermediate gabbro is part of the dark mantle, 
and we're seeing a churned-up regolith on top of 
it -sort of being the gaseous upper part of the 
flow having been broken down rather rapidly into 
the dark mantle. Okay, stand by a minute. 



Tape 91A/12 


05153914 CC 


0515h006 CC 


Okay. To summarize that again, reading -I guess 
I got ahead of myself here in the little deal they 
wrote up. At the present time we have two working 

hypotheses for the dark mantle, the gabbro -and 
the gabbro relationships to each other. One: the 


crystalline rocks that we found in the gabbro are 


an upper unit of the subfloor with their dark mantle 


cover unrelated to them in time. Key observations 
that they suggest here, are stratigraphy at Camelot, 
station 5, and other steep craters. Especially, 
perhaps, the trench and sheltered spots which arc 


unguarded -ungardened, as in plowed -for an older 
regolith underneath the dark mantle, if such a 
thing could be found. We don't think we found that 
yesterday. Or, look at the superposition relations 
between dark mantles and boulders or, the mantles 


instances of the mantle on the boulders or, inversely, 
of small boulders on the mantle. 


The second working hypothesis is that -is that 


the dark mantle is regolith derived from a vitreous, 
vesicular, flow top of the crystalline rock flow 


beneath. And, it again goes to say that perhaps 


the re -gabbro that we sampled yesterday was 


indeed the late flow; and what the regolith was, 


was derived from the vitreous, vesicular flow top, 


as it were. Again, many of the same observations 
are called for. In particular, they'd be interested 
then in looking at the coarser fines as they define 
as from a millimeter to 20 millimeters, for some 


sort of transitional lithologies and textures. In 
other words, what do the small walnut-size rocks 
look like, if you can in hand specimens? If I 
can get more specific in terms of EVA mechanics, 
let me say that we'll call out in real time vhe 


deletion of the tasks at stations 3 and 4, if they 
become necessary. And what we're planning on doing 
is, deleting the trench in the base of vhe scarp 
at station 3, and also, deleting the radial sample 


of the -on Shorty at station 4. That's the pro


vision that we're planning on. And depending on 


how the time is going, we'll call that out real 


time. We also have -The experiments remain pretty 
much the same. We'll deploy the charges at the 


same locations as we're planning in the checklist 


at the present time. We also don't -for your 



Tape 91A/13 


planning further ahead, we don't anticipate any 
significant changes in EVA 3. The charge number 5, 
which we were going to deploy at Emory, will not but 
didn't, will not be deployed dvaring EVA 2, but 
we'll deploy it on EVA 3 out at station 10. And, 


what we're going to do there, is when you take the 


8 pounder and put it between the seats, we'll then 
have the 3 pounder left over, and we'd like to put 
that on one of the footpads in the Sun -that's 


probably either the minus-Z or minus-Y footpad. 
And, we'll leave it there in the Sun until the 
start of EVA 3, in which case we'll put in the 


Rover underneath the I_P's seat. And, thermally, 
that looks okay. There is a probability that we're 
going to play the "return to the ALSEP game," and 
we're going to do this for a couple of reasons. 
One, we're going to go back and look at getting 


some more ALSEP photos. I guess Gordy says you've 
got that. And_ that will probably be at the end 
of EVA -in fact, it will certainly be, if it 
happens, at the end of EVA 3 when you go back to 
get the neutron flux probe. I might also say with 


regard to EVA 3 that, obviously, we're more inter


ested in station 10 than we were before. Another 
"return to the ALSEP TM goodie that we're looking 


at -if we have the consumables today when you get 
back from finishing station 5 -is that the lunar 


surface gravimeter has been unable to level itself 
over the night, and they sent some, you know, some 
thousand commands trying to get it straightened 
out, and they say it looks as though it's not 
level. And, so, we'd like Jack to go back with 
his practiced hand-on-bubble levels and recheck 
that at the end of -after station 5 today, if 


there's sufficient consumables. And, we've 
planned for Gene to just let Jack off and let him 
walk back to the LM, after he gets off and loo_s 
at that. And_ that's about -everything we have. 
As I say, in summary, that the big changes are 


going to be extra time at the beginning, taking 


care of the fender extension, and the probability 
of extra time at the end. Although we'll have to 
see how well the fender works and how things go. 
The probability of extra time at the end to allow 


for dusting and the time spent on those particular 


activities we'll probably end up taken out of the 


task at station 3 and station 4. Over. Comments?

Okay, Bob. We copy all that. Obviously, you're 


going to have to catch us in real time on some of 


the details there -on the charges and the task 


deletion. One question, did you say we were going 


to delete the trench at station 3? 


Roger. The trench at the base of the Scarp, in 


other words_ some of the stuff that you would be 


doing while Gene was taking the double core. 


What do you gain by that? 


Well. No conmient on that, Jack. 


If you haven't deleted Gene's tasks, then what am 


I supposed to do? 


You're supposed to help Gene_ I guess. 


Well, but that's not the way we worked it, Bob. 
Let's play that one in real time. 


Roger. That's why I said there's no point in 
marking up the checklist on that, Jack. Let me 


hit you with one more thing concerning the battery 


vemps. An initial reaction down here is that the 
battery temps were high on deployment because of 
particularly unfavorable heat soaking on the way 


out. And the Marshall people are hopeful that 


they'll be back to normal this morning. However, 
we're obviously anxious, as I'm sure you are, to 
get an early reading on the battery temp -that's 
number 1. And number 2, just for the off chance 


that the meter's not working, I think we've 
pretty much discounted that, because of the w_ _ 


the meter worked yesterday. But, on the off chance 


that the meter's not working, you might just lean 


over and see if the meter is reading zero before 
you punch in the circuit breakers, because that 
would give us at least a partial confirmation in 


that direction, that there's not something wrong 
with the offset. If they're reading -sitting 


there reading 30 to 40 degrees, then that prob


ably says something about the offset. And, beyond 


shat -


... 



Tape 91A/15 
CC Go ahead. 
CDR-LM I'll look at that, Bob, what the meter has indicated 
in terms of a temperature change. I'll look 
and see if there's a bias on Vhem at all. 
CC Roger. We -we again also think that that's probably 
not too likely. 
05 15 46 26 LMP-LM Bob, I think, based on what i saw yesterday, that 
the chances are pretty good that all the big blocks 
out here in the dark mantle area will be pretty 
much the gabbros. By the way, I looked at that 
with a hand lens last ni_ht_ and I don't know that 
you got the report, and I'm back to saying that 
it's probably closer to 30 -_0 percent plagioclase. 
It's very -it's a good gabbro, a final 
pyroxene gabbro, and it apparently has a fair 
amount of ilmenite in it. There's some bright 
shiny flakes within the rugs and some dark minerals 
in the matrix that are probably ilmenite. And one 
other additional possibility then, is that the 
mantling we're seeing here_ is the -is just dark 
fine glass -darker than usual, because of the iron 
and the titaniu_m in the rock itself. Also, the 
probability, I think_ still has to be considered 
that you're dealing with a true mantle that has 
been gardened enough that at least where we're 
seeing it now, in the first few tenths of a centimeter 
that it is unrecognizable as a mantling unit 
yet. The relationship to the large boulders is, 
I think, one right now, of just filleting and a 
small amount of covering because of the local 
gardening process. We haven't seen any clearly 
mantling relationships between the dark mantl_ or 
the surface materials here and the large boulders. 
CC Okay. Copy that. And, we'll be anxious to see 
what else you find out today. And one last _ord 
for your interest; the Marshall people have decided 
to allow us to go to 140 degrees on this EVA with 
the batteries, if necessary.

CC Okay, fine. We'll take a check, Geno. Let me 
ask you one question here on the -on Jack's water 
-on his PLSS water cell. We're showing about 
3 pounds too much water in the LM system, and we're 
wondering if you got the AUX tanks filled up in 
Jack's PLSS. Two questions. Did you -were you 
sure to have the AUX valve open and did you see good 
clear water in the sight gage with no bubbles after 
the fill? Over. 
LMP-LM I guess we'd have to say yes to those questions, 
but if you've got a question on it we can go through 
it again. I'd rather do that than take a chance. 
05 15 50 21 CC Let me make sure we want to do that. While we're 
making sure, I checked with both homefronts and 
Nassau Bay and Tucson are both in good shape. 
Geno, Tracy upstaged you for about 30 minutes last 
night on local TV during her own interview there 
and drew everybody away from watching EVA during 
that time. She did very well. 
CDR-LM Yes, that sort of -that sort of figures. Hey, 
Gordo, why do you say Jack's PLSS? Did you see 
the water drop in the LM when we charged mine? 
CC It was the profile of the water quantity as you 
were filling both PLSS's, and it was the fill -
during Jack's fill that looked suspicious like 
just maybe 3 pounds less than there should have 
been flow when you were filling Jack's. 
CDR-LM Yes, well, you know there -it's all -it's only ... 
to know whether or not you've got it filled. I 
sure don't want to go out there and have him just 
have some partial water. So let's do the conservative 
thing. 
CC Okay. i'll -i'll verify that. There was _ome 
drinking water going -going out at that thne, 
too, which muddles up the data a little bit, so 
we're not absolutely certain on that. 


Tape 91A/17 


LMP-LM Okay. We weren't drinking water while we were 
filling the PLSS, however. 
CDR-LM Okay. You come up with what you think best on 
that, and I going to copy John. 
05 15 52 00 MCC Okay, Geno, I don't think you need to copy this. 
Sort of just -ad-lib it. With your four chronopaque 
maps, tape two maps and allow about a 1-inch 
overlap to a 15-inch by 10-1/2-inch configuration. 
That's an estimate. And then repeat with two other 
maps, and then tape both the two maps -now four 
maps -tape them together, and you'll end up with 
a sheet that's about 15 inches by 19 inches, a 
sheet of chronopaque. And then tape both sides of 
it -the overlapping edges to strengthen it. And 
you can further strengthen it, if you tape an "X" 
of tape across both sides of it. And then, on the 
roll up, on the long axis, and secure it with a 
strip of tape and put it in the ETB. And on that 
strip of tape you secure it with -be sure and 
leave a tab on the end of it so you can get it 
off with your gloves. And then remove clamps 
from both the utility light units, and open the 
clamp jaws to max. And then tighten the mounting 
bracket that you've got on it so it will be swinging 
around; and stow the clamps in the ETB. You 
got that, Gene? 
CDR-LM Yes, sir. 
05 15 53 43 MCC Okay. And then -now you've got everything you 
need. And it's all put together and all ready to 
-to be fastened to the -to the Rover. And then 
when you get the ETB in the seat, you unroll the 
chronopaque sheet and you locate the front edge 
with the long axis fore and aft, even with -even 
with the axle. And you lay the edge of the sheet 
over the inboard guide rail and you clamp it. And 
you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard 
guide rail and clamp it. And, as I said, 
the inboard clamp must be directly over the axle 
to avoid interference while steering. And tighten 
the clamps securely, both of them. And then while 
you're driving around out there by yourself, it 
would be good if Jack could take a look at it and 


Tape 91A/18 
see if you're getting any unusual dynamics. And 
at station 2, you should inspect the fender for 
any unusual wear that might have been caused by 
this mass out there on the fender, of those clamps 
bouncing up and down. One thing about it, doing 
it in a suit, Gene, you have to push in with your 
leg and hold -and it's sort of a two-handed job. 
And I'm not sure in 1/6 g if you can position the 
fender, the pseudofender, on there without Jack 
say holding on to the long end behind the Rover 
so that won't -won't fall off. It works okay in 
one g for one man. But I'm not sure it's not a 
2-g proposition -a two-man proposition in 1/6. 
Over. 
05 15 55 27 CDR-IA_ Okay. We'll take a look at it, babe. 
MCC Okay, and you really have to bear down to get 
those --
CDR-LM I just --
MCC --things on a dovetail there. 
CDR-LM I just want to make sure of the geometry now. 
We want to put the -take two of those pages and 
put the 10-inch sides together overlapping, right? 
MCC Yes, sir. 
CDR-LM Then take two more and put the 10-inch sides together 
overlapping, right? 
MCC That's true. 
CDR-LM And then take those two pieces you've got now and 
put them end to end, so you've got the long -a 
long fender. Sounds right to me. Sound right to 
you? 
MCC Well, you end up with -you end up with four -
you end up with all four pieces in a big rectangle. 
See what I'm -you see what I'm saying, you've got 
a 15-inch by 19-inch sheet of paper. 


Tape 91A/19 
CDR-LM Yes, we got it -we got it, John. And I copy the 
overlap and everything. If you had no overlap, 
I guess you'd have about 16 by 20. 
MCC That's correct. But you need to overlap, and 
taping both sides of it gives it more strength, 
which you need in that situation. You just want 
to make sure it's not more than an inch, or you 
won't have enough to cover up those dovetails. 
CDR-IJ_ Okay, babe, we're going to work on it right now. 
05 15 57 25 CC Jack and Gene, this is Gordo again. On the PLSS 
charge, we're recommending you hook up Jack's 
according to the decal. Go right ahead and -stand 
by 1. Okay. Go by the decal and do the full 
5-minute fill on Jack's PLSS. It'll take that long 
to get the AUX tanks filled up, if it was indeed 
empty. And maybe that's something you can start 
and then work on the -the paper taping. Over. 
CDR-LM Okay. 
05 16 00 30 LMP-LM Okay, Gordy. I started -I'm on step 4 on the decal 
-step 5 on the decal. 
CC Okay, Jack. John Covington advises that the sight 
gage is not a certain indicator that you're filled, 
and so we're just going to go by time to be sure, 
and try to disregard the sight gage readings as a 
positive indication anyway. 
_P-LM Okay, understand that from the past, and we went 
exactly by time before. We'll try it again here. 
05 16 O1 06 CC Okay. 
05 16 05 41 CDR-LM Okay, Gordy. Is that about 5 minutes? 
CC Stand by. See if anybody timed you here. That's 
affirm; 5 minutes now. 
LMP-LM Okay. Step 7 is complete. 
CC Okay. And we did not see any water flow to speak 
of, so it probably was full.

I was just going to say that on the crater Aitken, 
on the other side, is probably -there are no no

iow Sun angle, anyhow, coming across there. There's 
definitely a mare floor in there. It's a dark 
albedo-type -flat floor with swirls in it; no 
definite expression of swirls. One thing that's 
quite apparent, you have a flow scarp in the north


east corner of it coming out of -oh, a little 


cloverleaf-type of an area there. I'm going to 
have to look the next pass over it to see if, on 


account of the south domical structure that's in 


there, it's breached. And I can't tell if the 


flow of material is flowing to the east out of 
that domical structure or if the flow is flowing 


into the domical structure. I ought to take a 


better look at that the next time -the next time 
around. 


Roger. We got you. See any lava marks on the 
crater rims, there? 


Well, that's -that's the -the lava mark is what 
I'd call -is almost a lava scarp -in -up in 
the northeast corner. There are some lava marks 


along the central peak. They aren't nearly as

that the material in the northeast corner of 
Aitken has flown out of that domieal little structure 
in there. 
CC Roger. Understand. 
05 17 42 51 CMP You know something -the observation that I think 
is pretty significant is the fact that most of 
the 30-kilometer craters on the back side of the

that are fresh -by fresh I mean you don't have 
any real definite ray pattern to them, but you've 
got a real smooth -not smooth but streaked 
straight -slope, 45-degree angle going down into 
the crater and the crater wall. And then you get 
down to the bottom of the crater, and you got a 
flat floor down there or sometimes there is a 
domical type of a floor. And the domical material 
down there doesn't resemble anything like the 
stuff that's slumped down the side.

05 17 46 52 CMP Well, this ridge system is running east and west 
down here. The color boundary isn't nearly as 
apparent in Crisium as it is in Serenitatis. Except 
that right under me right now there's kind 
of a subdued crater-type thing and with a southern 
part of a ridge. The ridge runs east -west, and 
it looks like we've got a flow coming out of it. 
Let me see if I can get a quick picture of that 
one. Well, lost my camera (laughter). Here it is. 
Oh, it's too late; it's gone now. You know something, 
you see this subsolar point, it's kind of -
zero phase -zero phase point, I mean, is following 
me right along out here in Crisium, so I get a 
different color straight out from the window than 
I do out from the edge of it. So I think that's 
going to influence my thinking. 
CC Roger, Ron. How does color of Picard -the r_m 
deposits on Picard compare to the surrounding 
mare material there? 
05 17 48 35 CMP Okay. The color on Picard is -is definitely 
darker. It's got a darker rim, darker material 
that goes out to -oh about a half a crater and 
some points extending out to a crater diameter.

white thrown out on top, you essentially got a -
as -as you go down the crater wall, you've got a 
white streak that goes all the way around it, and 
then you've got a dark layer underneath that. And 
then a white layer on below that.

05 17 50 30 CMP Well, the central peak material is -you know, 
it's more smooth-type stuff. This stuff in the 
crater walls is -fine, straight sloping, except 
where it is slumped down. Where it's slumped 
down, it's just kind of piled up -a jumble of -
type stuff, you know? 
CC Roger. 
C_ You know, in the crater nearest over there has 
the same color distinction around it for -out for 
about a crater diameter, except it doesn't have 
any of the light material on it at all. 
CC Okay, Ron, we might direct your attention to the 
dark halo craters in the western Mare Crisium. 
Are they impact or volcanic in origin? 
CMP You can see some of the rays from the crater 
Proclus have spread out all the way across here. 
And they completely cover up the ridge system 
that goes around there, so I can't see any color 
distinction on the eastern -or on the western 
edge of Crisium. 
CC Roger. We copy. 
Are they volcanic 
How about 
in origin? 
those dark halo craters?

Some of the -Yes, I was looking at the volcanic 


or the dark-rimmed craters, and some of them have 


what I'd call a -an eJecta pattern around them; 


and the others Just have kind of a raised rim with 


no apparent blocks. The one to the west -let's 


see, southwest -of that little V that sticks out 


there by Yerkes -that hill that sticks out there 


by Yerkes -now, that's the one that, to me, looks 


like it has an eJecta pattern around it with blocks. 


It's about a -oh, a thousand-meter crater. 


Roger. Got it. Oh that crater that you mentioned 


was a flow pattern, will you be sure and make a 


mark on your map on that, please? We're really 


interested in that. 


Okay. 


Should be coming up on Macrobius by now, aren't 


you? 


Yes, I can just barely see Macrobius. And -... 


be better out of window 3. 


Okay. We're standing by. 


I'm looking for any dark-halo craters in -I was 
looking for any dark-halo craters in this area 
that might be sticking through the Proclus rays. 
Well, you know, you compare on either side of the 
Proclus ray, though, and the same size crater 
rather ... Tranquilitatis or the -the moundy 
stuff before you get to Tranquilitatis are really 
underneath Coper -the -the Proclus ray. You 
get the same albedo of ray material from the small 


craters in either case. 


Roger. We understand. 


Oh, here's a Macrobius A and B. Course, J-3 is 
up there. The two dark craters -well, the one 
just -north, I guess, of Macrobius A, and also 
north of J-3 -that's the one that has the dark 
mound around it. It's got a small dome down in 
the center. It -it doesn't have any eJecta 
pattern around it -you know, no rays, no nothing. 


To me, that looks like -it sure looks like a

cinder cone to me. You get that same type of 
feeling. The dark halo that goes around it goes 
out for at least a crater and a half diameter. 
The raised dome down in the center of the crater 
is about a fourth of a crater diameter. And there 


are no rays. And it has a dark halo. 


See any color tones on that crater at all, Ron? 


Yes, the color on that particular -color of that 


is the same color as you see in Maraldi and as 
you see in the landing site. And that is what I 
consider the dark tannish -tannish gray.

Next time I guess. Right now, I'm looking at the

And the dark material stops before you get up to Oh, 
what's the crater that sticks into the side of 


Serenitatis and sticks out beyond the eastern edge 
of Serenitatis? Anyhow, the dark material stops 
before you get to there. The dark material only 


goes up to -let's see -There's a definite rille.

wrinkled ridge, there are two craters, about 
20 kilometers in diameter. And then farther east 
of that is the -the rille. A graben, it looks

color, and then I look straight down and I have a

_Tork on the fender before you do the geo prep. 
You don't have your cameras and bags to worry about 
at that point.

No, I mean_ why don't I turn that down because it'll

No, not too close to that wheel. 
Okay? I think that's good. 


Too bad we don't have one more clamp -well, one 
more clamp would probably interfere with the

keep an eye out for blocks along the rim there, 
because remember -we may be wanting to come back 


and move station 5 to an area where there's blocks, 
unless there are blocks at the present nominal station

for the way back. A second thing a reminder, if 
you do stop for a Rover sample or one thing or

and the assumption is_ of course, that driving time 
out equals drive-back time. And we're under a 
63-minute limit to get you from the LM out _o the

LMP-EVA 
Okay, Bob. Okay. We'll keep you informed. 


CDR-EVA 
Bob, I got the thing tube-locked, and I'm averaging 
probably 10 to 11 clicks. It's not exactly 
straight-line navigation, but I think I can hold 


most of it. 


CC 
Roger. Beautiful. 


LMP-EVA 
Watch the crater -there you go. 


CC 
And, Jack, a reminder -


LMm-EVA 
I tell you, when Gene decides to turn -whoo! 


CC And, Jack, a reminder on photos yesterday. You 
apparently took quite a few on the way back from 
station 1 to the SEP, and we're right nominal on 
budget now. But, considering the fact that we 
didn't do much sampling if you continue to use 
them at the rate you did yesterday coming back 
from station 1, at least as we understand it, 
you'll be pushing us pretty hard in the budget. 
Should be every 50 meters or every 100 meters. 


LMP-EVA 
Bob, okay. And you want to hear something? 


CC 
Roger. I'll listen now. 


LMP-EVA Okay. The surface is not changing in terms of 
the detail. The surface texture of the fine-
grained regolith still is -has a raindrop pattern. 
We're more -the blocks still look very much like 
what we sampled yesterday around the LM. They're 
light colored, apparently gabbros, with zap pits zap 
halos. Occasional craters show lighter colored 


ejectas both all the way down to -say half a 
meter in size. Other craters that are Just as 


blocky as those with bright halos have no brightness 
associated with them. Most of the brightest 


craters have a little central pit in the bottom 
which is glass lined. The pit is maybe -a fifth 
of the diameter of the crater itself. It's a 


fairly standard thing for most of these fresher 


craters, 
is that little central pit.

areas on the photos are essentially -blocky. 
They're probably 30 percent blocks. Ail of them

clinopyroxene gabbro. 
CC Thank you. 
LMP-EVA Now_ the surface of Camelot is mantled -or the 
rim -is mantled with the same dark-gray material, 
and it has the same surface texture -a very fine 
raindrop pattern. The saturation crater size does 
not look bigger than a half a meter, if that.

pretty quick. I think it's right up in front of 
US. 
CDR-EVA Yes, I think you're right. 
05 19 05 52 CDR-EVA We can definitely see the light mantle as it comes 
out over the valley here, and we're looking at 
Hole-in-the-Wall, although it's still too subtle. 
We're looking right at Lara, as a matter of fact.

are. See it? 
LMP-EVA Yes, that's Horatio. We're right on course, sir. 
There's a little depression we didn't talk about, 
though, between Horatio and Camelot. But it's a 
depression and not a blocky crater at all. As a 
matter of fact _ the total block population has 
changed out on the -once we get away from the rim 
of Camelot the block frequency is quite a bit 
smaller, it's down -maybe to only -less than 
1 percent of the surface.

be incident rock rather than -I think it is 
rather than bedrock -in the rim area of Camelot.

there. 
LMP-EVA Yes. That's Horatio. 
CDR-EVA Let me give another mark on the southern rim of 
Horatio. 
L_P-EVA Okay. The scarp looks very smooth from here -
no obvious outcrops at this time. Don't seem to 
be penetrating to any bedrock in the area we're 
traversing now, just to the southeast of Horatio. 
Horatio has a blocky wall; however, the upper 
several tens of meters, probably, of rim look as 
if it's either mantled or composed of -the light-
gray regolith material we've been driving on. 
The blocks do not come to the rim of Horatio.

you guys on that shortly. 
LMP-EVA Okay, Bob. The surface is not changing. We see 
no craters that seem to penetrate into bedrock 
out in here -that is with blocky rims, and that's 
quite a contrast to the area we sampled at station 
lA yesterday. I see -I cannot see in _¥

Boy, Bob, one of the remarkable things is the 


Sun-angle difference on that light mantle when 
you're looking at the slopes of the Scarp versus 
what we're on. I hate to use a familiar te_,

a raindrop influence than back at the LM, or ii1 
the darker mantle. 


Okay. Copy that. 


Yes. Might -might by. 


I think so.

these little craters is much light -much more

crater in view that does -that has a blocky rim. 
There's fragmental rims based on, almost certainly, 
incident rock, but no blocky rims. 
CDR-EVA You know, one of the reasons those craters look 
lighter is because of their Sun angle. Walls of 
some of these little craters -It's the same 
material we're driving on, I'll bet. Yes_ there

light tan and to white, and then there are 
the blue-gray rocks. There's one major outcrop 
of blue gray about a sixth of the way down the

report from the back side on this one here is 
that I took another look at the -the Cloverleaf

domical crater of the Cloverleaf -it has a breach 
on the east -east side of it. It -I can't tell -
There's -there's a flow -In other words, the 
domieal structures, themselves, are part of a 
flow material that is partially filled up the 
breach. In other words, the breach has either 
flowed into that little domical structure before 
the domes were built, or else all of that stuff 
that's in the mare floor has flown out of that 
domical structure before the domes came in. In 
other words, the domical structures, themselves, 
are different time relationship to the floor,

it looks to me, right at this point in time. 
Also, the texture is a coarser texture than the 
floor itself, in other words, the floor, to me, 
is kind of a standard mare flat-floor-type stuff. 
And I have to compare the texture of the domical 
hills to -Oh -I guess what I would imagine is

the -the dark part to the south -on the 
south side of Copernicus? In other words, you 
can see albedoes real well, and there's a dark 
area that extends maybe -oh, a half a crater 
diameter, three-quarters of a crater diameter to 
the south_ and then it kind of flows down in I 
don't know -! don't want to say flows, but at 
least it carries itself do_ -down the crater 
wall -down to the crater floor. And this is 
kind of in the south maybe from 6 -or let's see, 
from about 4:30 to '[:30° And then the rest of 
the crater all the way -all the rest of the way 
around it, you can see light albedo step all away 


around the crater. The first step down about a 


fourth of the way down in the crater wail. 


I don't recall that, but sounds good, Ron. 


Okay. Unfortunately, those things really disappear 
fast. 


Roger. Take 
-take a look at the peaks and con


centrate on that mountain in the center of the 


peaks, if you will, Ron. 


Okay. Is -it's already passed now but I can 
recall as -as I was looking at it, the peaks well, 
seems to me like there's four and they have 
the same light albedo texture as the -not texture, 
but the same light albedo -as that first -rings 
on the inner wall of the crater. And then inter


spersed between those white peaks were a darker 


you could just tell it's the darker -albedo. And 


you couldn't

Yes, I guess we are.

I guess we are. Gosh, I was going to say the 


craters are white -whiter than they have been. 
So, we're back in it. And -


I think -


--even the phase point's brighter, too. 
I think that place where we had those small, 


blocky craters was within the dark mantle. I They're 
not evident here in the lighter stuff. 
Yes, yes.

I understand. 


I'm not sure I've got enough guts to make them 


intentional. Man everything's getting to look 
big the closer you get. Hole-in-the-Wall looks 
more promising, though, Bob. 


Yes, I don't think that's going to be any problem 
until we get up and look back. Oh, man, what a 
trip this is going to be. Golly.

down, 1 percent or less. However_ the bigger craters 
do have more blocks; but nowhere does that

that's on the walls and the rims of the craters,

20 meters in diameter that has some blocks on it.

Bob, I'm starting up the scarp at 081, 6.6, 
and 5.7. 
Okay. Copy that, Geno. 


This is the first tongue(?) of the scarp. 
I don't even think the Rover mows it's going 
uphill. I've got about 3 -7 or 8 amps. See 
what's on top here. 


You're making about 8 -8 clicks. 
And I'm full bore. 
(Laughter ) 
Well, I'll tell you, this Rover doesn't know it's 
going up the hill. 
Looks to me like you may be able to head just like 
you' re going. 
Yes. Hey, Bob, we'll make it. 
And get down -Yes. 
We will make it.... Get my antenna adjusted. 
Okay. Whatever makes up the light mantle is -in at 
least, the incident rock that it forms is much 
lighter than anything we see. Those fragments 
probably -are 30 percent lighter than any fragments 
we see on the dark mantle. And that's around 
the fresh craters. But it is not blocky. Bob, 
are you still reading? 



Tape 9hA/ll

CC Roger. 
05 19 46 25 CDR-EVA We're doing a little zig-zag navigation. I'm -
literally came up a slope at about a heading of 
240. We couldn't get through the actual turn to 
the south because there is a big crater right at 
the foot of it. So we're just making our way 
through some relatively local undulating slopes 
that get pretty steep, but it seems to be no 
problem. 
LMP-EVA Yes, I think we're in good shape. Bob, I can't -
there are not any blocks big enough to really make 
a statement about what the rock is. But it -it 
really doesn't look like gabbro anymore. 
CC Okay. Copy that. 
LMP-EVA It doesn't have that --
CC And a reminder that eventually you're going to 
have to turn to the south a little bit to pick up -
the final thing at the -station 2. 
LMP-EVA We're not on top of that scarp, yet. We're still 
in the Hole-in-the-Wall rim. 
CC Okay. Copy that. 
_P-EVA Bob, as far as lineations in the soil or on the 
surface that are observable at this range, I don't -
i don't see any. I think there may be a finer 
raindrop pattern on the light mantle than maybe 
%here was out on the dark. But that's an awfully 
hard judgment to make.

Doing fine, Bob. We've slowed down between about 


5 to 8 -maybe 5 to 10 clicks most of the time. 


I'm going to head right up there, I think. Get 


around this crater. 


Pretty healthy roll you're going to have here. 


Yes, I'm going to head more straight up the hill. 


Once I get up on top, I'll be all right. I'm 


going to head down in this hole and then up that 


way. 


Yes, I think -


I don't mind pitch, but I sure don't like roll. 


I don't either. 


Now I'm going to head straight up -I'm going to 


head straight up that slope right there. Okay. 


Bob, I still -It looks like maybe the large frag


ments in here are still crystalline. They have 
white zap pits on them. But they do not yet really 


resemble the gabbro. 


Okay, Jack. Copy that. Give us a hack when you 


get up on top of the scarp there. 


Okay. 


Let me tell you, Bob, I've got to go cross-slope 


some of the time because the Rover is really 
working to go uphill now. 


Ail right. 


But we' re _lmost there. 


As I look up the scarp to the west, there are 


some big blocks scattered around on our horizon; 
but, again, I would guess that we're not dealing 
with more than -2 or 3 percent total coverage of 
blocks in here, at that. 


Well, I think, for the most part -for the most 
part, we're on top... -



Tape 94A/13 
LMP-EVA Yes, we're -we're on top. 
05 19 49 53 CDR-EVA Bob, we're at 7.8 -correction 078, 7.2, and 6.2. 
CC Copy that. 
CDR-EVA Jack, where was Nansen with respect to those tracks 
up there? 
L_-EVA Well, they never really had any good tracks pinned 
down, I don't think, on that -You'll be able to 
see Nansen, I think soon as you get over this hill. 
CDR-EVA Boy, I tell you, when we look back, that's going 
to be quite a sight if we can see into that Sun. 
We have been coming uphill. Well, I'd say this is 
the -this is the last straw to the top. And is 
she workingX Come on, baby. 
_P-EVA Okay. I think you bear -
CDR-EVA I'm going to try to get over along the base of the 
massif now. 
LMP-EVA Yes. Head towards that track area there, anyway. 
There are a lot of boulder tracks coming down from 
the blue-gray rocks, Bob. We'll see whether or not 
we're going to get to those tracks at Nansen, or 
we might want to move over to the track and see if 
we can find the boulder that made them. 
CC Okay; if they're in the vicinity, it might be a 
nice idea --
LMP-EVA But there's no question where those tracks come 
from. 
CC And we gather you're slowing down to about 5 clicks 
now_ coming up this last rise. 
CDR-EVA Yes, I'm back up to about 7 to 10 now, Bob. That's 
the slowdown -is becau_e that's about all it wiil 
take.

Bob, I have 
the impression that there is a dipping 


zone of blue-gray outcrops or block concentrations 


up there on the Massif that trends from the high 


point just beneath the Earth -cross-slope -and 


probably is 
-at least the apparent depth is 


oh, I don't know, 10 or 15 degrees to the east. 


It looks like those outcrops may match up along 


that trend. 


Okay. 


Jack, I'm going to head right along this ridge 
because I think that's the depression we were 


talking about. 


Yes, That's 
Nansen down there. 


Right -Where are you looking? 


I think, right below 


I think you're right. I think that's it. Let 
me get over here, and then I'll head a little bit 


to the south. 


Yes, we're a little more west, I think, than we 
intended to be. 


Yes, I think 
you're right. 


Bob, 7 -Wait a minute -7.8 and 6.5. 


Bob, I've had an impression, and I can't prove it 
yet, that we're dealing with more heterogeneous 
rock. Possibly there are breccias in here. But 
it's -it's -awfully hard to tell right now. 
They're very light-colored rocks -I think even 
lighter colored than the gabbros. 


Okay. We'll 
soon find out. 


I'm afraid those -I think we can follow those 


tracks -the pictures, maybe, or 


Yes, I think 
we can see some of those coming down. 



Tape 94A/15 
LMP-_A I think the ones from the big outcrop of blue-gray 
rock, though, are the ones going into Nansen. 
05 19 53 29 CDR-EVA Bob, my best guess -let's see -077, 7.7, 6.6 -
is that we're coming up on the northern side of 
Nansen. 
CC Okay. We copy that, Geneo. 
CDR-EVA And, let me tell you, this is quite a Rover ride. 
CC It sure sounds like it. 
CDR-EVA That is quite a machine, I tell you. I think it 
would do a lot more than we'd let it. 
Lb{P-EVA (Laughter) That's right. I think that big crater 
up there on the side is the one that you can see in 
the photographs, just above station 2. 
CDR-EVA Yes. I think if I come up here, do a hard left 
turn; you unbuckle your belt, you'll roll right 
down into the bottom of Nansen. 
L_._-EVA I'm afraid you're right .... 
CC Okay. And remember we're going to about 068 and 
about 7.4 will be station 2. At least that's our 
estimate. 
LMP-EVA Bob --
CDR-EVA Okay, there's Nansen over there, huh? 
LMP-EVA Well, I think so. 
CDR-EVA Yes. 
LMP-EVA I think you're right. It's got to be it. Got to 
be it. Yes, Bob, I think we're into a breccia 
population now. I think the blocks in the light 
mantle are largely breccias. 'fhey're mottled in 
their characteristics. Their white zaps do not 
seem to be nearly as burned. They tend to be 
chalky when they get hit. At least, in the large 
craters, the walls are chalky looking. Oh, yes. 
We've got boulders in station 2.

Hey, Bob. We're very clearly going downhill now, 


into the trough area that -that surrounds the 


Massif where 
-or between the mantle and the massif. 


But the trough is much greater in extent than just 


Nansen scale. It's probably a kilometer wide. I

Okay. Okay, Houston, the number of blocks plotted 
on the map are not nearly enough. In the greater 
than 1-meter range, there are many hundred blocks 


on the flank -on the massif flank of Nansen and 
up around station 2, where we are. There are only 


one or two blocks on the light mantle side of 
Nansen. It looks as if the material in the bottom 
of Nansen is overriding the light mantle materials 


of the north wall. That's just an impression. 
There's slightly lighter albedo than the north wall 
of Nansen. 

Okay. Copy that, Jack. Looks fantastic up there.

doesn't look like more than about 10 or 15 percent 


fragments. Some of the light -the light-colored 
fragments seem to have fine-grained -very fine-
grained dark halos around them. The zap pits do 
not have white halos, so I suspect they are not 


crystalline. They might be glass -they might be 
the vitric or glassy bre¢cias. At least, the one

sounds obvious -that some of the debris that has

got. So we'll get another one. 
05 20 33 42 LMP-EVA Okay. The same kind -or the contact of vhat 
rock looks very much -looks like it might be 
finer grained -but it's about the same -in 517. 
That's the contact in the -the inclusion s_de of 
the contact. Keep going after the other one, Gene, 
I'll get this in you -your bag. 
CDR-EVA Bob, you could probably see this rock if you look 
over this way. We're high enough.

Yes, we saw it, Geno. Quite a sight -quite a 


goodie. 


Okay. Let me see if I can't get this one here. 


There it is. 


Okay. The host rock for the inclusion, which 


appears to be also crystalline but may be a 


recrystallized rock of some kind -


Can't see it too well. 


--metamorphic -also looks like a high 


plagioclase -high feldspar, anyway. That's in 
bag 518 -and that was a loose frag -fairly 


loose but in place fragment along the fracture 


zone. 


Okay. -


Will you hold this a minute? I'm going to try 


to get the rest of it up there. 


Okay, 17. And for your thinking in the next few 
minutes, you might also factor in the guestion 
the backroom raises about taking 10 minutes out 
station 4 and adding it into this station, given 
the wealth of interest that seems to be occurring 
here. You might think about that. You never haven't 
been to station 4, so it's a little hard 
to judge. But if you think 10 minutes can be very 
profitably spent, you might as well do that. 


Okay, Bob, we'll think about it. This is a medium-
green anorthositic gabbro, and it looks like it 
has some pastel-green allophane (?) crystals in 
it. Did you get it? 


We copy that. 


I can't get any more of it, Jack, up there. 


I 
can't reach any more.

been shadowed as long as this rock's been here. 
LMP-EVA Okay. I'll do that.

CDR-EVA I've already got it. 
LMP-EVA Well, I'm getting it from this way, and they like 
that. Did we kick any dirt in under there? 
CDR-EVA No. I don't -no, I don't think so. Go way down 
in there. Let me get a couple of after pictures.

you can see their structure.

area there. There's no point in climbing up there

as far as I can reach back there now.

on this talus slope. I'll try to take a stereo 
of it. 
CC Okay, Jack, that sounds great. I guess there's 
always a problem of getting the in-place, glass, 
if you think that's appropriate at this point. 
Word along those lines, though, is we'd like your 
Rover moving in 11 minutes; so it's probably not

the orbital science report for the CMP if you 


would like to hear itt 


Yes, I sure would. Go ahead. 


Okay. Let's talk about the UV. The far UV spec


trometer data has been excellent throughout the 
mission. Indications are that the hydrogen atmosphere 
of the Moon is much less than expected. The 
Aerobee launched from White Sands on Monday failed 


to get solar UV calibration because an instrument 


viewing port failed to open. A second Aer_oee 


flight is scheduled for tomorrow. The IR scanning 


radiometer is performing beautifully. Indications 


are that the subsolar point surface temperatures 


are higher than Earth-based observations predic%ed. 


Many thermal anomalies are being seen in the Ocean 


Procellarum area west of Copernicus. A few unusual 


cold spots have also been detected indicating areas 


of fine soil with few and no blocks. The lunar 


sounder data is excellent and the specular power 


monitor signals correlate with surface features; 


HF data indicates that layers are being detected 


in the mare areas. Over.

put that SC -that full SCB underneath the seat to 
keep -make sure the top doesn't bounce open and 
lose some of those rocks. 
CDR-EVA Well, you can't take better advice than from those 
who have been here. 
CC Roger on that. 
CDR-EVA Their advice has been pretty good so far.

_P-EVA Oh, look at that. Boy, I tell you. Okay, Geno, 
why don't I follow our tracks back; well, lmtil 
we get over the big hump and then we can start 
picking our way to 3. 
CDR-EVA I've got 3 pretty well spotted. 
LMP-EVA Okay. Okay; low gain is set, and heading about

CC No, no readings called out. And when you get going, 
I'll give you a little advice on what we're 
going to do on the way to station 3. 
LMP-EVA Well, let me tell you a few things first, Bob. 
CC Okay, start telling me. 
LMP-EVA I think those two --
05 21 07 47 CDR-EVA We're rolling! 
_P-EVA All right. Those two major kinds of blocks that 
we sampled there -it was about the two varieties 
we saw in the area, it's a long extrapolation I 
realize, but they do resemble in color, and I 
believe in texture, the blue-gray rocks and the 
light tan rocks up on the Massif. So I feel confident 
that -fairly confident that we s_unpled at. 
least the two major units visible from a dist,ancc 
in the South Massif. 


Tape 95A/h 
CC Excellent, excellent. 
LMP-EVA I think that there is some -a lot of postmission 
work to be done on correlating the angularity and 
possibly even the albedoes of the rocks we sampled 
with those on the Massif. We should have good -
good pictures of them -of both from a distance 
and up close. 
CC Okay. I'm reminding you --
LMP-EVA So we may be able ... --
CC --That extrapolation is the nature of our art. 
LMP-EVA Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. And, Bob, I'm not going to -
How am I on the film? 
CDR-EVA Oh, my golly! Look at that valley! 
05 21 09 10 CC Stand by. I'll get that for you, Jack --
CDR-EVA I think there's a --
CC I'm picking you up fairly well, now. And before 
you guys get too far, a couple of comments we want 
to do on the way. If -there is a Rover sampl_ 
stop in your checklist, it used to be at the 
073 and 6.3; it's the first thing there, halfway 
out to Hole-in-the-Wall. And we're now going to 
have that Rover sample stop at 078 and 7.0. That 
should be along your tracks going home. So, 
about 078 and 7.0, we'll have the Rover sample 
stop. And the gravimeter people have won today, 
and we're going to stop and get off the Rover and 
get a gravimeter reading at that location. We're 
taking out another stop, I'm not sure quite where. 
And right now, Jack, you're right on on the film 
says a little note in front of me. 
LMP-EVA Okay. I'll take pictures, then. 
CDR-EVA Bcb, we're on the top, coming off the highest lobe 
of the scarp looking back into the valley. And 
it's quite a scene back there, but we still cannot 
see the LM. That may be it -I don't know. 


Tape 95A/5 
LMP-EVA Hey, turn a partial pan, I know it's into the Sun. 
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
CDR-EVA Okay. Let's take one from right here. I want -
I want the whole thing. 
CDR-EVA You ready to start? 
05 21 10 28 LMP-EVA Yes, I got it. 
CDR-EVA Start taking. Well, that's -
CDR-EVA Take the whole thing. 
LMP-EVA Go ahead. 
CDR-EVA Get around this crater. 
LMP-EVA I got a pan down in the valley. This is just 
going to be right into the -
CDR-EVA Yes. Don't take that one. Get it up as we come 
around. You get it? There we go. 
LMP-EVA Okay. 
CDR-EVA That's the one we want. And you got the valley? 
LMP-EVA Yes. Keep going. Okay. Keep turning arom_d 
over there, and I'll get that scarp. 
CDR-EVA That's beautiful. 
LMP-EVA Isn't that something? Man, you talk about a 
mysterious looking place. They can cut some frames -
some parts of those pictures out and make a aicc 
photograph. (Laughter) TV cameras, maps -
05 21 11 10 iMP-EVA Okay, lookiag at the north man -the li_ht m:mtlc. 
No more comments except that by that rake s_nplc 
and just looking, there's certainly -are fewer 
fragments than we saw at station 2. The main 
thing that we can tell about the light mantle and 
when we're on it, of course, is the light-colored 
craters. The fresher craters all aspear _o be 
light colored. As they get older, they seem to -
the albedo goes down and potentially have been 


Tape 95A/6 
dusted with material from the dark mantle or 
from other sites. Either that or it's just the 
lunar patination that we're all familiar with. 
CDR-EVA You know, it's a shame. They could have had TV 
coming down here because my heading isn't going to 
change much at all. The high gain could have been 
on the whole time. 
LMP-EVA Bob, none of the craters out here in the light 
mantle appear to show -they've got new bedrock. 
Almost all of them are instant rock craters. 
CDR-EVA Say, Bob. Give me that bearing and range again 
for the --
I_MP-EVA 70 right here. 
CC 07 and 7.0. 
05 21 12 32 CDR-EVA --up on the hill. How about 071 and 7.0? Will 
that do? 
CC Yes. I think that that will be enough to hack it. 
CDR-EVA Well, if not, we can go down there. 
CC No, no_ no. Stay on the road -stay on the road 
you're on. 
CDR-EVA Well, I'm not on any road, but I'm stopping here. 
CC I thought you guys were making a road -

LMP-EVA Hey, right over here to my right --
CDR-EVA Okay. 
LMP-EVA Maybe it's the best we can do, but it's still going 
to be on a slope. 
CDR-EVA Well, I'll level it off on a local --

LMP-EVA Yes, I see it. Right there.

little bit? Right up here. What's your -can 
you tell your roll? Okay, now that's about zero 
right there. What's your roll? 
LMP-EVA Let me turn this off. 
CDR-EVA What's your roll indicator ... 
LMP-EVA Oh; zero. 
CDR-EVA Zero? 
LMP-EVA Yes.

CDR-EVA What about station 3? 
CDR-EVA Okay, that sounds reasonable because it's just 
nothing but lots of rolling terrain. 
05 21 26 25 LMP-EVA Okay. Bob, I -I think we have a good sample of 
only partially contaminated light mantle in that 
last Rover sample that Gene accidentally discovered 
was right under our feet. It's almost 
certainly the light-colored material that's the 
crater -we've been talking about in the walls of 
the crater. And, as a matter of fact, that instant 
rock sample I took was light-colored and 
probably represents the same stuff, indurated 
slightly. 
CDR-EVA Light-colored mantle has that bluish tint that 
you saw in those rocks. 
LMP-EVA Yes. 
LMP-EVA I still don't think there's anything. We ought 
to -we ought to get a core in this light mantle 
sometime; and probably station 3 is going to be 
the place. I hope that's still in the agenda. 
CC Roger. It's still in the agenda.

Okay. 


Do you want to hear another range and bearing 
right now? 


Do you get the feeling that we're the only ones 
out here, Jack? Looking around -073, 10.3, 6.6. 


Copy that. 


Bob, I have a feeling that whatever darkens the 00h, 
there's a beautiful little glass-lined crater, 
pit bottom crater -whatever darkens the light 
mantle is not a -a one-time-only mantling of 
darker material. It's something that happens over 
a period of time, continually, because craters of 
all sizes and apparent degradation are dark darkened 
and there are lighter craters that are 
light to varying degrees, there seems to be a 


continuing -continuum of albedo change. 


You know that little crater on the side of the 
North Massif that we're thinking about goin_ to 
doesn't look nearly as light-colored or haloed as 
it does in pictures_ does it? 


You mean -Yes -no. 


Now, let's see where we are, I don't want to run 
into that big crater at the foot of the -


I think you're aZmost to the rim.

LMP-EVA Boy, that's a sight, isn't it? 
CDR-EVA That's spectacular. 
LMP-EVA I don't know why something that's all _proximately 
the same hue should -
CDR-EVA The lack of color has got to contribute to the 
inability to judge distance. 
LMP-EVA See the lobes coming out -looks like lobes out 
from the Scarp. The Scarp rather being a line 
in there on the, on the plain, appear to be lobes. 
I got a couple of shots of that. Whereas when it 
gets up on the Massif, it's a fairly continuous 
curve; although it does appear to be younger, at 
least -at least there's less relief on it for 
the first few kilometers of that bend there. 
CDR-EVA We're going to have to go down like the way we came 
because there's that big crater down at the bottom, 
I'm afraid. 
CC Yes, I think we agree with that suggestion, too. 
LMP-EVA Bob, the Scarp, so called Scarp, impresses me as 
less of a scarp than a series of -of lobes which 
roughly have a north-south trend. And we've beell 
driving over various hummocks within those lobe_. 
CC Okay, copy that. 
CDR-EVA I think we made a gross mistake in not trying to 
let them get TV, my heading hasn't changed much 
at all here. Then we would have a spectacular 
view. Look at it out in that valley, Jack.

cC Roger. Your 
good work. 
comm's great and you guys are doing 
LMP-EVA The fragment population is not -the fragment 
population hasn't changed, nor has the crater population, 
as near as I can tell. I hope the LRV 
photos will give you more detail than that. Okay, 
Gene, do you have the target over there, that set 
of --
CDR-EVA Yes, I got to get over to this next knoll and I'm 
going to be off the Scarp. We're about three-
quarters of the way down. 
CDR-EVA Isn't that sharp shadow out ti,ere the LM? See it 
way out there? Almost under the Sun. It's got 
to be. It's the only sharp shadow out there. 
Right under the Sun, straight down there. 
LMP-EVA Probably. 
CDR-EVA Okay, 
Hold 
I'm going 
on. 
to try to make it down there. 
LMP-EVA This is what? 
CDR-EVA This is the one we climbed up. 
LMP-EVA Oh, there's Nemo over there to my right. 
CDR-EVA Yes, sir, this is the

LMP-EVA Well, I don't know.

is if there is any crater on the

i'd rather not.

Okay, now where we got to go. 345 roughly. And 
we want to go to 087/6.1 -


Okay. you're -I think you're headed right 


right for where we want. 


Yes. 


It's that bright -see that bright crater? You 


can just start to see station 3 over there now. 


Okay, navigation says I've got more than 9 de


grees -I should be increasing range. Bob, we'rE 


at 079, 11.5, and 5.7. 


Okay, beautiful, guys. Really going smooth. 


Amd I'm headed northwest. 


Roger. in fact, we understand it's been going 
so smooth down here that they haven't even spilled 
any coffee in the SPAN room yet this mission.

CDR-EVA Oh, actually, I guess -they would want it -is 
there -I can just start to see two craters --
LMP-EVA You know what the problem is? 
CDR-EVA --and they're closer to Lara. 
LMP-EVA I got a full planar view of the high gain and I 
can't see a thing out there. 
CDR-EVA That's right. 
LMP-EVA Full planar view. All I can do is see underneath 
it. 
CDR-EVA Well I -going to take it broadside. See, I can't 
see a lot of craters now that I'm out in front. 
Oh, I guess I can see them both. 
LMP-EVA Here's a nice sharp little hole; look at that. 
Bob, the texture of the light mantle -surface 
texture -is really no different on the Scarp, on 
its flank, or out here to the east of the Scarp. 
Fragment population, crater population, everything 
looking about the same. If there is such a thing 
as a light mantle, it seems to be uniform across 
the Scarp. 
05 21 37 59 CC Okay, I copy that, Jack. 
LMP-EVA Here are your tracks -Hey! We crossed somebody's 
tracks -we sure did ... we made a loop.

quick change of mind when we came over that ridge. 


Yes, sir. 


Okay, we're still headed northwest, Bob. 


Here -I-


Okay, Bob, I guess one thing we don't have a 


handle on yet is what are the -I think we sampled 


them -once in a Rover sample, but what are the 


fragments out here mixed with the light mantle? 


Okay, I copy that. 


I think I got one at our last -our last gravimeter 
stop, a small one, and I guess there's one other 


Rover sample, but -station 3, we probably ought 


to make sure we get a representative suite of 
those fragments. 


Roger. Agree to that. 


Hey, Bob, how long have we been out? 


Say there again, Gene? How long have you been 
ous? 


How long have we been out? 
3 plus 45. 
Thank you. 
We're at 083/5.7. Well, it certainly doesn't 


look like the geology of Norway, but it certainly 
is interesting. 
That must be Lara right there, huh? 



Tape 95A/23 
LMP-EVA Yes. 
CDR-EVA On the left. You can see the blocks on the other 
side of her. 
LMP-EVA That's right. I told them about those earlier. 
That's the only no -I think, Gene, you want to 
bear a little bit -Hold on -a little bit to the 
left. See those two craters, two bright craters, 
that are Just this side of Lara? 
CDR-EVA Now -well -I'm not -
LMP-EVA You're pointed right -almost right at them, now. 
CDR-EVA Okay, I can barely see them now through that high 
gain. 
LMP-EVA Okay. 
CDR-EVA But I can see -I know where we're going now. 
05 21 40 25 LMP-EVA Those are the two I think they wanted us to be at_ 
and I think that's a good choice if we can get up 
there. 
CDR-EVA Bob, I want to get some 500s the way that scarp 
flows up on top -well, it looks like it flows up 
on top of the North Massif. Now if may look like 
the North Massif may drape material down upon it. 
Look at that. 
LMP-EVA Yes. 
CDR-EVA Not really. The texture is so different, it just 
doesn't look like as old a surface, but definitely 
different. 
LMP-EVA Yes. 
LMP-EVA Wish they had never said anything about pictures, 
because I've tended to not take enough -to do 
better.

Oops, oops! Oh, there's another big crater with 
a pit in it. 


What was it, 17-1/2 or 18 clicks we hit coming 


down the Scarp, Jack? 


I don't know (laughter).

Well -


Let's see what's over on your right. Let's see 


if we can get at that scarp over there. 


I've sort of lost track -


We're about there. 


i think we expected you guys to be a little bit 


farther north. We were getting a heading of 080 


for the bearing which really kind of says you 


said you were going a bit farther north than this.

got a wrong thing down here.

LMP-EVA I think we need to go -go back there a little 
bit. 
CDR-EVA Yes, we're at 087/6.0. I think that's probably 
about right. Why don't we stop here? 
CC Okay, 17, that's a great stop. That was _¥ mistake, 
I was reading the Hole-in-the-Wall coordinave.

Jack, is one coming right there? 


Looks like a pretty good location to sample the 
rim materials of this crater. 


Bob, I'm at the south, let's say the east-southeast 
rim of a -oh, 30-meter crater in the light mantle, 
of course; up on the Scarp and maybe 300 -200 me


ters from the rim of Lara in a northeast direction. 


Okay, I copy that. 


It's body shows up as a bright crater -a bright 
crater on your map. There's only about a half a 
centimeter of gray cover over very white material 


that forms the rim. 


Okay. And, Gene, give me a call when you get 
parked and I'll give you an update on what we want 


to do. 


Okay, I am parked. 


Okay, good. We'll take the Rover read-out £irst. 


Okay. 087, 12.7, 6.0; 105 and 100. On the battery 
temps 100, 120. The rear motors are off 


scale low and the forward motors are 0 and 240. 


Okay, we copy that. Understand that 240 now instead 
of a 340. And what was your heading, 045? 
Heading is 043. 
OKay. We copy that. 
Zf I ever gave you a motor temperature of 3kO, 
that figure was erroneous. 



Tape 95A/29 
CC Okay; Roger. And what we'd like you to do, Gene, 
is we'd like you to get the CSVC samples yourself, 
that will essentially be your sole task at this 
station, Jack can do the solo sampling and we'd 
like to get one pan and the gravimeter, and then 
we'll leave this station. We're going to absorb 
some of the time we spent with the extra gravimeter 
reading and some of the time we absorbed at station 
2 in the longer stay time in sampling at 
station 3. That's our plan. So it will be CDR 
for the CSVC for the long cans, excuse me, and 
LMP for solo sampling and then a pan by Jack, i 
presume, and then the gravimeter and then leave. 
And, Jack, you might check your film. We aren't 
quite sure where you are right now, before you 
get too far from the Rover. 
05 21 50 17 CDR-EVA Okay, Bob. 
CDR-EVA Bob, you got any -Bob, you got any preference 
up in this area where you want that long can? 
CC Negative. That's something that was sort of near 
the scarp, but you're parked so near the scarp and 
that something, remember we do it in solo, we 
only did it with the Rover, so you'd have to stay 
right there beside the Rover and do it. No expectations 
of doing it otherwise. 
CDR-EVA Yes. That's what I figured. 
LMP-EVA Gene. 
CDR-EVA Yes, I think you're in good shape. Yes, I don't 
have any other choice. Matter of fact, if there 
is a scarp, and if it is a fault, I'm right -
right on it because the projection of it would be 
uphill a little bit. 
CDR-EVA Yes, I'll be right on the side of it. I'm parkL_d 
on the side of it if it exists. 
CC Okay, and, Jack, what's your frame count? 
05 21 51 35 IaMP-EVA Well, 1 -122.

Okay, copy that ... Go ahead, Gene. 


_at do you need, Gene? 


Oh, yes. Bob s I dug a trench in the side of this 
crater. I've got down-Sun pictures of it. There 
is quite a marbling of light and dark soil or fine 
grain material. It looks as if there's a uniform, 
about 3-centimeter layer of light material over 
that marbled light and dark. On the very top 
surface, there's a half centimeter of light gray, 
and when I say dark, I mean a medium gray. 


Okay, copy that. Sounds like a great sample site. 


Okay, I'm going to start sampling the soils, and 
then I'll get you the fragments. 


Okay, I presume that we'll at least have the single 
upper core which we can use to sample of 
that stuff in the soil, and we 


Oh, there's no guarantee that this is a crater 
rim. 


Okay. And, Gene, are you still near the Rover? 


Yes, I am. 


Okay, we'd l_ke to get the SEP blankets opened,

Oh, boy. 


Yes.

Okay, we copy

though, all I could see was the surface texture, 


and it had the modular or elongate modular texture 
that those breccias had up on the South Massif.

tures are 100 and 130.

Tape 95A/49 
LMP-EVA Okay, Bob, as far as any of the things we talked 
about trying to see at the surface, dynamics or a 
variation of the light mantle, I think you've heard 
it all, there isn't much to say about the dynamics 
right now. I have a feeling that the surfaces 
are old enough that all those kind of detailed 
relationships have been obscured .... is just 
about the same all over here, it varies, but there 
are no systematics that I've seen. 
CC Okay, copy that. Do we ever see a Rover flag come 
up when you've got high temperatures there on the 
battery -have you seen the flag up yet?

looked like that that might have been a crater 
that had got to bedrock. There may have been a 
high point, or let's say a thin point in the 
light mantle, and it got down to bedrock. But I 
can't -It's the most blocky-rimmed crater we've 
seen for a long time. 
CDR-EVA Yes. Ail these others are nowhere near that -
look at that. 
LMLP-EVA No. It was about 15 meters in diameter. 
LMP-EVA Bob, there -there are no obvious lineations, at 
the scale we can observe, on the light mantle. 
I think the pan photography and the metric stuff 
may be what you'll have to use for any directional 
trends out in here. Depending on what we decide 
the origin is.

Okay. Are you reading us through the LM or 
through the low gain? 
As far as I can tell, we're reading you through 


the low gain. It's been working just great tonight_ 
Genoo 
Okays that's great -Tonight? 
--because I just scraped bottom on the LCRU. 
if it's still working, I'm glad to hear that. 
Okay, we're 093 and 5.2. We're almost there. 
Going to be right on the rim of that crater. 
Okay. And, 17, the word from the backroom is 


with that last Rover sample you got, we'd like 
to go straight to station 4 -and we won't get 
the one here at 094 and 5.3 -5.1, excuse me. 


Bob, I thought the purpose was to sample the 
light mantle? 
I -We talked to them about that, but they -We 
didn't sample light mantle at that last one. 
--I agree. I talked to them about that. But 
they are so anxious to get to station 4, i guess 
they don't want to do it. 
Wells how goout it, Gene? A little real time I 
think we got to, right here.

CC Roger, Gene. 
LMP-EVA Houston, there aren't very many rocks that just 
sit on the surface. Ail of them seem to -to be 
slightly buried to moderately buried. That one 
looked like it might be vesicular. There's a 
trench -linear set of craters. 
CDR-EVA Hold it, babe. We got to do a little detouring. 
LMP-EVA Okay, what we're looking for is 101 --
CDR-EVA Yes. t00, 4.6, I'll detour. I'll Just get down 
this slope. I don't see Shorty though, do you? 
LMP-EVA Wait a minute, is that it? Is that it out there 
straight ahead? 
CDR-EVA Well, let me get down this slope. 
LMP-EVA Something's dark out there. I think that's it. 
CDR-EVA The -the dark -it might be right over there to

It Just rolls over the side, doesn't it? 


Yes. 


I don't know what, else we can say about it, though 


(chuckle). Okay, we're getting a good view of the 
North Massif, and the cross-hatched lineaments 
that Gene has talked about are over there, also. 
They seem to be a set that -that plunge about, 
oh, 30 degrees to the east and another set that 
plunge about the same to the west. Plus the 
boulder tracks, which we see occasionally over 
there. And there are areas -boulder fields up 
on the Massif itself, such as we saw on the South 
Massif. As a matter of fact, it looks like there's 
one Just above where we may -where station 6 may 
be. Straight ahead of us there, Geno. 


Um-hum. 


About bearing 060 from our present position_ which 


is 098 and 4.8. 


if i change that heading, that LCRU comes right in 
on me. 


I don't see any -anything like layering up zhere. 
Although the upper boundary of those boulder fields 
on the North Massif, and, as a matter of fact, on 


the South Massif -


Thav's Shorty straight ahead of uss I think. Yes_ 


yes, that's got to be it. 



Tape 96A/5 
LMP-EVA --all tend to have a linear boundary. That's 
the upper portion of the field; the lower portion 
is strung out downslope. That looks like it might 
be Shorty. Yes. 
05 22 40 07 CDR-EVA We're at 9 -099, 4.7, Bob. 
CC Okay, great. Sounds like you're just about there. 
CDR-EV& Yes, I think we got it in front of us. 
CC Okay. 
LMP-EVA Bob, looking at the Sculptured Hills, I think 
Gene's comments the other day about Bare Mountain 
would apply. There's a small relief -or small 
amplitude hummockiness to the surface. It's 
formed by cross-hatch of -Let's say the slope I'm 
looking at is sort of west-facing slope. So on 
the other side of Wessex Cleft, it's formed by 
lineaments going -plunging about 10 degrees to 
the north and about 10 degrees to the south. And 
the combination gives some h_mmocks that are quite 
distinct. 
CDR-EVA Well, you know it's hard to see a blanket here, but 
that's got to be Shorty right there. 
L_-EVA Okay --
CDR-EVA It's the only large -real large -
LMP-EVA We want to park. I don't think we'll see a blanket 
down --
CDR-EVA I don't either. 
LMP-EVA it -Well, i think -At least we're going to see 
where the break in slope is for the rim. ,v_f 
goodness. 
CDR-EVA Oh, look at the boulders sitting on that rim. 
LMP-EVA it's different.

are 92, 90, 102. And 128 on the batteries. Off-
scale low on the fronts, and off-scale low on the

CDR-EVA Yes sirX

CC Sounds like an interesting crater, in any case. 
CDR-EVA --this is an impressive one. 
LMP-EVA Wait until you see the bottom of it. 
CC Okay. 
LMP-EVA Okay, Houston] Shorty is clearly a darker rimmed 
crater. The inner wall is quite blocky over -but 
except for the western portion of it, which is less 
blocky than the others. The floor is hummocky, as 
we thought it was in the photograph. The central 
peak, if you will, or central mound, is very blocky 
and jagged. And the impression I have of the other 
mounds in the bottom is that they may -they look 
like Scarp masses that may have come off the side. 
CC Okay; copy that and --
LMP-EVA That's just what they look like. I'm not sure 
that -They have a -they have a bench appearance.

inclusions of a darker gray rock also intensely 
fractured. The fracture systems, I think, will

up most of it. Let's try right over here. 


I've got a little piece of glass in my pocket. 


Bob, the upper portion of the core is going to be 
a little bit disturbed, because we've walked 
around the area so much. 


Okay. Copy that. 


There was a little piece of black glass -You 
may want to get up here ---
solid black glass. 
Okay. That -did you get a -hold it, and I'll 


get a shot. 


Take your picture. That's about as far as I could 
shove it in. 
Okay. And, 17, while you're doing that, was the 


gray mantle over the top of this, or was this 


showing all the way through to the surface? 
No, it was over the top. It was about a half a 
centimeter over the top. 


Copy that. 
He's getting about -about 3 centimeters a whack. 
Very good. 
I'll tell you, it's a lot harder going in than 


_hat double core was back there. It's pretty hard. 


It acts like it's inherently cohesive. It breaks 
up in angular fragments.

material we've been sampling -sampling in here -
to a very dark gray material. And there's a lot 
of ... stuff tha_ goes down -radially down into 
the -into the pit of the crater. 
CC Okay. Copy that. Outstanding. 
LMP-EVA Hey, Bob, those cores didn't feel like they -the 
follower went down at all. 
CC Okay. 
LMP-EVA Shouldn't it have gone a little bit? 
CC Not necessarily, if it's pretty compact stuff. 
You were having a hard time getting it in. 
LMP-EVA Well, I thought there was a little space up there, 
but maybe I just didn't feel it. 
CC Not very much --
LMP-EVA I don't think there's much danger of them coming 
apart. 
CC Okay. Great. 
CDR-EVA I got to take a couple of more pictures at that 
contact slope over there. I know -you can't see 
it from where you are, Jack, but I guess we got 
to leave. Otherwise it would he nice to sample 
that dark stuff up on top.

CDR-EVA We can get a spool -oh, i bet I'm out of filml 
Well, I got them all anyway, Bob. i'm at 162. 
I'm out of film. That stuff -and you're looking 
at me with the camera -that stuff is up toward 
that boulder, around that -about as far away from 
that boulder on the other side as we are on this 
side. And we want a hack at that boulder, too.

a series of three craters. There's some boulders 


on the -on the Talus slope of the easternmost eastern 
slope of the west -eastern slope of the 


southernmost crater, the one we're closest to. 


Now how does that look to you? 


Well, it looks like -and see, there's the other I 
don't know what it looks like. The northwest end 


of the V has a white block -white blocks on it boulders 
-on the inner wall and right at the rim. 
And the northeast end of the V looks like it has 


somewhat darker rocks. 


Yes. 


Part of that is shadowed, but I think they are 
darker. And they look like about the sa_._eas 
down here near the tip of the V on this -

No, I didn't either. 


I -we obviously did -


I thinkwe did. 


Right at Victory, but it didn't show up. 


Looking into the Sun, you can't tell any difference 
anyway. However, I tell you, I certainly get the 
impression there is a mantle. I would say that 


Oh, I think so. I don't know what it is, but the 
dark mantle exists. They're Just -the craters these 
craters are just too big not to have thrown 
up blocks. And they're either subdued by the mantle 
or they haven't penetrated it. 


And a lot of -and these blocks -


And I think you probably have both. Excuse me, 
Gene. 


And I -I'd say they've been subdued by the mantle. 
That -that really imposes an impression on me. 


Yes. There are those that appear that way, like 
Horatio, for example, or the big ones, But others, 
I think, are too young. They Just don't penetrate. 
Particularly those that are big and have bright 


halos. 


Well, now -yes, but the only ones that look 
fresh and not enough to penetrate are these little 
cnes with the glass in then. 


Well, there's been some big -big fresh ones. 
We'll -we'll look for one. 


Now there's one with glass in it, probably.

But it -I don't have the impression of draping, 


so much as I have Just of burial. And I have a 
feeling that the zap-pitting process Just has 
cleaned these boulders off -of anything that may 
have been on top of them, in excess of what's 


around them, 
right now. 


Okay, you're 
talking about -


Also, like Horatio, the -Go ahead. 


You're talking about mantle -blocks -then mantle and 
then cleaned off by zap pits, in other words. 


That's right. Most of the rocks seem -that seems 
to be what has happened all over the Moon that 
we'ye looked at. But the rocks are always cleaner 


than the -than the surface, of course. The -the 


far rim of Camelot -you can see -fact is every

seems -the rim seems to be completely 


covered or, at least, the blocks don't show through. 
They show up in the wall but not at the rim. That's 
much like Horatio, but not to the extreme that we 


saw at Horatio. I'd say, at Camelot, the mantle 


is -oh, maybe -at the most -the rim thickness, 
if that's mantle, is on the order of a half of 


what we saw 
at Horatio. 


Okay. Copy that.

Because when I looked it with the hand lens, it 
looked like a fairly normal gabbro -like some of 
those that have crystallized with the mare basalt. 


Where are you? You ready to take them back -


I'm back over here. What I want is a sample of 
this soil off one of these rocks. 


Okay, let's get that now and then let's get the 
rake sample. 


But it looks to me like it's soil that's been 
thrown up there rather than -This rock is about 
3 meters in diameter and it -but it's one of the 
flat surfaced rocks. It only stands about -at 
the most -one-third of a meter high. 


Copy that. 

But we can get up about a meter from the -the 
soil/rocks interface and get soil off the rock, 
I think. 


Okay. See what you can do. 


Whoops, oh, yes; I got some soil. 


Don't kick up anything new. 


No, that 's all right. 


455 is that 
bag number, Bob. 


Copy that. 


Okay, this is soil from a half a meter in. It's 
about a centimeter deep and a half a meter in. 


Let's take that chip there that's lying on top 
with the next scoop. 


No, I'm going 
to -


Let's take the soil on that. No. I was taking No. 
Okay, take that one then. Well, that's 
another bag. Put this -before you pick that one 
up, pick that little chip up 



Tape 97A/3 
LMP-EVA Well -I don't -I don't want to get the chips. I 
want the soil. Either that or a coherent rock. 
CDR-EVA Okay, there you go. 
LMP-EVA I think we better leave it at that. 
06 00 05 43 CDR-EVA Okay, 465. Pick that other one up and I'll bag 
it real quick. 
CC Copy that. 
CDR-E_A That's the soil from on top the rock. And we're 
taking a piece of the rock itself, which looks 
pretty much like the other one, Bob. It might 
be a little bit more vesicular.

06 00 06 06 CDR-EVA You're right again. Here we are and I'll be able 
to grab it with my hand. Put this away. 
LMP-EVA Okay.

the soil boundary. We need to get a -let me get

away from the boulder. I'm going to get my after 
while I'm here. 
CC Okay, 17 -LMP-

boulder soil sample. So it's a match pair, really, 
in that regard.

I think I'll go this way. (Laughter) 


Gee, it seems like a short day. (Laughter) 


Well, I'll tell you, the time went fast. 


Okay, you've heard about this country. Hey, 


looking over there, though, there's no -we're 


about -oh, 50 meters from boulders at -in 


Camelot. And their appearance from this distance 


is the same as what we sampled from 5. I think 


we've pretty well identified the subfloor, Bob. 


Okay, sounds like we have and sounds like from the 
very deepest -even from the bottom of Camelot it 
looks like it's about the same. 


It sure does. I can't say I understand it. But 


that's the way it appears right now. 


You can't say what, Jack? Okay, understand that. 


I can't say that I understand. 


Copy. 


Whatever filled this valley -it certainly was 


different than the Massif. I think we've proved 


that. And it, presumably, at least everything I 


see indicates that it was an igneous extrusion of 


some kind. Either that, or we're -the whole 
valley's been tilted and we're looking at a -some 
strange cross section, planar more or less 


relative to the other mountains, of a crystalline 
body that was formed at depth. But I don't think 


that's likely.

we've planned to go.

the wander factor was, but I'm sure it was pretty 
high.

deploy, probably. 
Yes. Whoo. 
Did we ever get any glass out of the bottom of 
those craters? 
No, we haven't, we've got to try to do that before 
we leave. There haven't been any good -

Okay, Bob, I've got a UHT. 


Okay, when you go back to the LSG, Jack, we first 
of all would like a reading of where the bubble 
is in the circle, whether it's in the center. And 


what we're going to have to have, unfortunately, 
is to have the bubble centered in the inner circle 
because the -this is, apparently, a requirement, 


even though we didn't train to it, apparently it's 
something that came up, and it's going to have to 
be within the inner circle of the bubble. The 


first thing we need to do is, when you go up there, 
is to see whether the bubble is in the center of 
the circle. 


Okay, Bob. That bubble is centered. 


Okay. Okay, the next thing we want you to do is 
put the UHT in the socket there, and move the -Hey, 
Bob. 


--LSG from side to side -Bob 
-


--do not pick it up. Okay, go ahead, Jack. 



Tape97A/19 
f LMP-EVA I did not have to touch it, it is centered. 
CC Okay, but now they're worried that it's stuck like 
your gimbal thing was last night and, also, the 
thing is that maybe -we maybe -something's hung 
up inside, and by moving it we can jostle it free. 
They do not want it picked up, but they'd like to 
have UHT put in there and sort of have the instrument 
rocked from side to side to again see the 
bubble move. And once that is done, to then press 
it down into the ground and again realign it and 
put the bubble within the inner circle. Over. 
They would also like to see if the gimbal is free. 
LMP-EVA How much do you 
me to rock it? 
travel? 
want me to -how much 
How far should I let 
do you want 
the bubble 
CC Basically, we just want to 
go up to the outer circle, 
And again, you ... 
see it move. You -you 
that's -that's plenty. 
LMP-EVA There 's only one circle. Okay. 
CC Oh, I mean the outer rim, the -the rim of it. 
06 00 B2 05 LMP-EVA Okay, I did that. 
is swinging. 
It's still centered and gimbal 
CC Okay, we copy the gimbal is swinging and we copy 
you moved the bubble out to the edge of the bubble 
level and come back into the inner circle.

It is on -It's on 20, Bob. 


Okay. In that case, I guess you're free to come 
home ° 


Well, what is basically the problem with it? 


They haven't been able to level it for some reason, 
and they were afraid that the thing wasn't level. 
They were hoping also maybe by moving it that you 
might Jostle it a bit and it would come to level, 
but I think we'll Just have to think about it some 
more. The first presumption -the easiest solution 
was to have it unleveled, which case we could 
fix it this way. But I guess that's not the case. 
We'll have to see what happens overnight. Give us 
a chance to follow the tradition of coming back to 


the ALSEPtomorrow. 


Well, do you want me to change it's posi -it's 
level alittle bit -put it off level alittle 


and see if you can work it. 


I don't think so, Jack. That doesn't sound very 
good tome -


Well, it might be air in the level bubble or 
something. 


Why don't you Just leave it there if it's centered 
with the level bubble within the inner -within 


the inner circle there. That's the requirements 


as far as we can tell, and we'll Just have to leave 
it overnight again. And why don't you come on back 
to the LM. 


Okay, Gene, 
are you at the Rover? 


Okay. Yes, 
sir. I'm parked. 


Okay-



Tape 97A/21 
CDR-EVA Gave you my readings. 
CC Okay. You gave me my -your readings and when 
you get done, let me know, because the first thing 
we want to do is work on the SEP a little bit. 
06 00 35 00 CDR-EVA Okay. Stand by. Get TV. Okay. What do you want 
to do to the SEP? 
CC Okay, Geno. When you go back to the SEP now, and 
let's do this first and get it out of the way, 
it'll -you can probably do this anyway while 
Jack's coming home. When you opened the blankets, 
remember that at the back of the SEP there was a 
piece of Velcro on the case and a piece of Velcro 
Just above the -Just inside the rear hinge on 
the covers, and this is what you sort of peel back 
when you go to remove the back end there so you 
can get the DSEA out. You remember that piece of 
tape there? 
CDR-EVA Yes. That came off. 
CC Okay. 
CDR-EVA That came off. 
CC Okay. This is on the side away from you as you 
stand facing it. Right? 
LMP-EVA Oh, no. That's the side -Go ahead, Gene, I'm 
sorry. 
CDR-EVA Okay, go ahead. 
CC Gene, I'm -if you stand facing it, in the back 
away from you is this -there's a strip of Velcro 
on the case and there's another strip of Velcro 
on the blanket itself and this is the Velcro you 
have to tear off or to unhook, as it were, when 
you come to tear the blankets down to get the 
DSEA off. Remember that piece?

what we're interested in, number l, is that piece

to cool it, does that Velcro come open? Over. 


Well, that's the Velcro that's so full of dust it 
comes open, Bob. 


Okay, and so what happens -


Trying to stay -it's hooked -it'll stay. 


Okay. Well, the feeling-


I don't know if you can see that but it's -Well, 
you can't depend 


Okay, well, feeling is that -


Bob, I swung the covers and -they will stay open 
about 150 degrees. 


I -Stand by a minute. What you're saying is that 
the cover actually stands up a little bit in space. 


Now, if you want the cover open, I can open it and 
normally it should swing 180 degrees parallel with 
the top of the SEP. 


Okay, but does that Velcro in back stay mated? -


Well, the Velcro holds -the way that we've been 
opening it -it holds. Yes, it's being mated but 
it -but it and probably it holds the covers open

is the Velcro that helps the -keeps the covers 
· closed.

Velcro since the one had come off.

in the back part of the SEP where the DSEA is in

0602 09 02 LMP-LM Say, Joe, our cabin pressure is rising even 
higher, now. About 5.7. 
CC We copy that. 
LMP-LM Joe, Joe, we had the commander's hoses stowed, but 
in SUIT FLOW. That might have done it. Is that 
right ? 
CC Sounds very plausible, Jack. We'll look at it a 
little more here. 
06 02 lB 14 CC Challenger, this is Houston. Requesting you move 
demand REGs A and B to EGRESS, please. 
06 02 13 28 II4P-I_ They're EGRESS. 
CC Okay. 
CC 17, Houston. We noted down here that your SUIT 
DIVERTERS went to EGRESS and we want the demand 
REGs to the EGRESS position, please. 
I_MP-I_ That's right, but the SUIT GAS DIVERTER extends 
when you go to EGRESS. 
CC You're right, again. 
06 02 17 04 LMP-LM Houston, do you figure we're relieving? 
CC Jack, we don't think so. It looks like you're 
pretty steady at between 5.5 and 5.6. We're 
watching it very closely, however. 
I_MP-LM Okay, you know when we had that problem this 
morning, I hope I didn't -the backflow did not 
hurt something when I had the I_MP's hoses stowed 
in the ISOL valve and SUIT FLOW.

Jack, just for your information, we saw about the 
same thing last night. The only difference was 
the pressure didn't climb quite so high. So, we 
think whatever it is, it really doesn't involve 
the problem -small problem you had this morning. 


Okay, Joe. 


Okay, Joe. We got the commander's PLSS back in 
the recharge station. We got a new battery in it, 
odd numbers and a new -and a new canister in it 
and we are working on the I_4-on Jack's right 
now. 


Okay, Gene. Sounds good. 
17, Houston. 
Go ahead, Joe. 
We are still watching your cabin pressure down 


here. Could you check for us, please, if the 
PLSS fill valve is securely closed? 
Yes, it was closed. 
Okay. 
Joe, do you want me to check out the regulator? 


Stand by. 
Houston, Challenger. Do you want me to check the Okay.

remembers, but when we were at Shorty, fumbling 
around, trying to get everything done, I said 
there was a piece of very shiny black glasslikelooking 
material that reminded me of -of obsidiml. 
Well, it's not. It looks like a very fine-grained 
gray rock. But, it's a fractured piece and it 
looks like it -I've picked up fractures of about 
three or four vesicle faces on it. The vesicle 
faces are very shiny and that's what reflected 
and caught my eye. I think the unique part about 
it is -Jack may want to tell you sc_ething else

about it -the unique part about it is -I picked 
it up Shorty. Undocumented, halfway between the 
Rover and where we were sampling that orange 
stuff. And it will be in bag 12 Echo. 


Okay, Geno. Copy, 12 Echo. And, I was assured 
by the folks here when I came in -


That'll go in it. 


--that -that you did indeed have shiny sample 


of some kind in your pocket and would probably 
find it later on. So, we called that one. Could 
you turn OFF the POWER AMPLIFIER -


Okays we'll put in it in SCB-8. 


Okay, go ahead. 


Okay, it's off and we will put that rock in that 


sample bag and put in SCB-8. 


Joes thi§ -rock looks very much like 12008, 12008. 
It's a fine-grained, coarsely -very coarsely 
vesicular gray rock -probably basaltic. 


Okay, Jack. Real fine. We 'll -want LOW BIT RATE, 
POWER AMPLIFIER, OFF, and LOW BIT RATE and we can 
maybe label that one 17008. How does that sound? 


No, you got to label Gene-rock. I was going to 


tell you those other things, but I thought I'd 


let Jack. 


Okay, thank you. 


The vesicles, if I may project the size of them, 
probably were up to 4 or 5 centimeters in diameter. 


They're irregular in shape, but they're clearly 


vesicles and it looks like they are lined with 


either glass or very fine-grained crystals. 


They're very shiny.

irridated [sic] ham or frankfurter morning, cnd 
I guess we can work that out. 
CC Roger, Gene. Apparently, the Surgeon is happy 
with either of those days. And we want you to 
turn to -right now, to 5-7 in the checklist and 
perform that -one particular step at 150 hours, 
which will prevent the computer clock from overflowing. 
And that's the "PROCEED, VERB 37 ENTER,

I'll continue on with the changes in the checklist 
here. Page 5-6, left-hand side, where it reads 
"Configure ETB." The -the fourth line down that

"Hotel, India, Juliet, and Romeo in LCG compartment.'' 
Then going up to the right-hand side under

Okay, that sounds like the thing to do. And a 
note on your demand regulators. We're showing 
that the demmnd regulator Alfa is -has good integrity 
and we're now in the process of checking 
the demmud regulator Bravo. I've got a couple 
of_fairly quick questions here when you're ready 


for those. 


Okay, Joe. Go ahead with your questions, and integrity 
is certainly what we need around here, 
right? 


Okay. Jack, a Question for you to begin with. Is 
your gold visor sticking halfway down? Apparently, 
that's based on a discussion earlier. Over. 


Yes. Apparently his visor is sticking. 


Which one? The gold visor? No, he said his sunshade 
is sticking halfway down, but his gold 


visor's not. 


Okay, that answers the question. We couldn't tell 


from the TV whether it was the visor or the sun


shade. That's fine. We also heard some discus


sion about possible wear in the seats of the suits 
when you were dusting each other off. We want to 
know if you could see the -any hint of the aluminum 
layers showing through in the suits. Over. 


No, Joe. Not to worry. It's just a few scars on 
the PLSS thermal blanket in back where you probably 
rub the seat when you get in. Nothing on the 


suits. 


Okay, Geno. Now two real quick geology questions 
that will help us do the planning for your EVA 
tomorrow. The first one has to do with station 4. 
And you called out some material on the rim there the 
crater at station 4 -which looked like bedded 


spatter. And we're wondering if that resembled 
things that -that you'd seen in Hawaii? Over. 


Hey, Joe, I think they misheard. I think I may 
have said shattered and you might of said -thought 



Tape 99A/5 
spattered. No, I didn't -neither one of us intended 
to leave that impression. The rock -the 
big rock we sampled was -looked like shattered -
intensely shattered gabbro, such as we've had 
around the LM. The rocks, probably more significantly, 
that Gene -one of which Gene picked up 
with the fine-grained vesicular basalt -co_ _ely 
vesicular basalts. And we didn't have any time to 
really examine the interrelationships of those 
rock types there, but those were the two fragment 
types we saw.

to us now. Also 
I_P-LM Joe -Joe. 
CC Okay, go ahead. 
06 03 58 02 LMP-LM The bottom of that crater, now, had material that 
was extremely disorganized in its aspect and, 
really, we didn't have time to ex_mlne it in detail 
in order to decide why it was disorganized. 
It did not necessarily look like the boulder that 
we sampled at the rim. 
CC Okay, Jack. Understand that. A question about 
the boulder you sampled at the rim. Would you 
compare the basalt in this boulder to -which I 
you may have called a gabbro, I'm not sure -in 
any case the basalt -to samples which you collected 
at Camelot and at ALSEP. Over.

CC Okay, that's our impression, too. Thank you. 
That's -that's it for us on the questions. And 
for information, we're showing your cabin pressure 
is holding fairly steady even with both those 
demand regs on.

CC Jack, I don't know if it's significant news, but 
at least I know you will be interested. Both 
your demand regs look good now. We show no evidence 
of a lesk there and it may have been that 
just recycling them reseated them and solved whatever 
problem we had. You can go ahead with the

LMP-i_ Go ahead, Joe. 
CC Roger. This is a news report to eat by. I'll 
combine an orbital science report with a sports 
report, an unusual combination here. i'll start 
out with a sports report on Monday night football, 
which you may not have heard yet. Joe Na_ath 
triedmightily to lead the New York Jets into the 


Tape 99A/8 


American Football League playoffs, but the Oakland 
Raiders grounded the Jets in a fourth quarter 24 
to 16 blitz. Namath passed for more than 400 
yards but, in spite of it, New York scored only 
c_e touchdown. Moving along to the successes of 
CaptainAmerica, I'll run down different items in 
the SIM baa here, beginning with the UV spectrometer. 
In general, the data has been excellent. 
We're getting indieations that the hydrogen atmosphere 
of the Moon is m_ch less than expected. In 
fact, I don't think we're detecting any, but 
rather setting a limit on the amount of hydrogen 
around the Moon. There was an Aerobee launch -
an attempt at an Aerobee launch -from White Sands 
on Monday to calibrate solar UV radiation, but 
this launch failed because an instrument viewing 
port in the rocket failed to open. A second 
launch -let's see -was scheduled, I think, for 
today, and I don't know whether that was successful 
or not. I guess it'll be launched later 
today. The infrared scanning radiometer is performing 
beautifully. Indications are that 
subsolar-point surface temperatures are higher 
than we've detected from our Earth-based observations 
before. We're seeing many thermal anomolies, 
particularly in Procellarum and in the Procellarum 
area wear of Copernicus. And we're seeing also 
a few unusual cold spots, which apparently are 
indicating areas of very fine soil with a few or 
no blocks in and on the soil. The lunar sounder 
data is beautiful, and the power monitor signals 
we find correlate with the surface features. And 
the HF data indicates to us that we are detecting 
a variety of layers in the mare areas. 
06 0_ 16 52 LMP-LM Joe, this is Jack. Do you know where specifically 
they're seeing the hot spots west of Copernicus? 
CC Jack, I don't have it on the page in front of me 
here. We're going to check into it and I'll get 
back to you in a second. 

CC Jack, this is Houston. With regard to your questions 
on the hot spots, apparently they've not yet

indexed the -these warmer sources that they're 


detecting to theCSM ephemeris, and -and so they 


don't know exactly what they correspond to as far 


as the surface features themselves go. SoI 


can't help you on that right now. 


Okay, Joe. Just curious. 


And, Jack, TELMU handed me some numbers which I 


think you will be interested in. From the 
EVA-2 EMU s_mmary, the elapsed EVA time was 7 hours 
ptus 37 minutes plus 22 seconds for a new outdoor 


record under international rules. The rest of 


the sheet looks free from problems in a comforting 
way. Let's see, average metabolic rates -for 
you, Geno, 855; and, Jack, you're running at 


around 920. And that, relative to premission 


averages of around 850. And you have a grand 
total EVA time now of 14 hours 49 minutes and 


35 seconds. 


Very interesting numbers, Joe. Do you have any 
idea how the metabolic rate compared to yesterday? 


Good question. Let me ask on that one. Yesterday 


you were running at 1045 and 1090. So you're 


down considerably from your work rates of yester


day, which is good news. Maybe you're learning 
how to do it more easily or something like that. 


Yes, but we spent a lot of time riding today and 
a lot of time working yesterday. 


That's true. But I guess that's not taken into 


consideration of the average here. It's certainly 
true. We can ask for the metabolic rate of the 


Rover. I bet that is pretty impressive for today. 


Well, don't -don't get me wrong. Driving that 


Rover is ... But I'll tell you, it keeps your 
attention. 


I'm sure it does. 


It keeps the passenger's attention, too.

I'm sure it does. We noted some comments when 
you were rolling along today -and reading between 
the lines from time to time. 


Actually, Joe, for good long spans on the run up 
to station 2, except when we had to pick our way 
up the Hole-in-the-Wall, I was _mning full bore 
at anywheres from, I guess, what'd I say, l0 to 
12 to 15 clicks. I didn't hit 15 going up very 
much. Coming down I did, but it's -it's really 
a "stand by for turn and watch where you're going" 
type of run. Because the small craters, -of 
course, are the ones that can really Jolt you. 
But the trouble is, you can't -you can never see 
what's Just over the next ridge, and the next 
ridge maybe 20 meters away, and you Just can't 
see it until you're there, and you don't know 
whether its a dish crater or pit crater. 


Roger, Gene. We copy that. 


Joe, that des 


Go ahead. 


That description -that description fits the 


geology up in there, because we weren't seeing 
blocky riww,_d craters and otherwise you would have 
been able to tell more easily about the old versus 
new craters, which would be the ones you could 
either go through or not go through, respectively. 


Roger. 


That's a super machine to drive though, Joe, I'll 
tell you. If you had enough time you could 
really learn to -to take it all the way. But 
you don't really do that, Just the second time 


around. 


Geno, was it spraying dirt at you today? Could

Hello, Houston; Challenger. The LMPs PLSS is 
charged. 


We copy it. 


Joe, bow's the weather got down there? Any better? 


Gens, the weather is better. We were really socked 
in yesterday. That front's moved on through the 
Houston area, and it is cold and clear tonight, 
suspect. It's been a while since we've been out, 
but they are calling for it to go down right near 


freezing. 


Okay. Thank you. 


Hey, Joe; Challenger. 


Go ahead. 


They succeeded in leveling the gravimeter, yet? 


Jack, we'll check it, update our information on 
that. My understanding at the moment is that 
they've not, but -but they're thinking that the 
unit's Just too cold and they're in the process 
of warming it up by dumping heat into it by running 
some of the equipment around it and in it, 
and they've by no means given up -given up hope 


for that unit. 


I figure that means that my fooling around with 
it didn't help _hem. 


Apparently, it -it didn't do too much for them, 
but what it did do was convince them that it's 


probably somehow locked up because its tempera-
ture's not right yet. And they're not worrying 
about whether it's level or not level now. They're 
-they're confident that it's been set up okay, and 
now they're just biding their time to bring that 
temperature up. We'll get some more words to you 
sometime tomorrow on it as you make your traditional 
visit to the site again -ALSEP site again, 
probably. How are you coming along with your sleep 
prep?

your TV camera there. It's fun, in fact, to watch 
the -the tracks that you're leaving behind in -
in the -the lunar soil, both footprints and Rover 
tracks. And some of us are down here now reflect-
Lug on what sort of mark or track will someday 
disturb the tracks that you leave behind there 
tomorrow. 
CDR-LM That's an interesting thought, Joe, but I think 
we all know that somewhere, someday, someone will 
be here to disturb those tracks. 
CC No doubt about it, Geno. 
L_P-LM Don't be too pessimistic, Joe. I think it's going 
to happen. 
CC Oh, there's no doubt about that. But it's fun to 
think about what sort of -of device will ultimately 
disturb your tracks. 
LMP-LM Well that device may look something like your 
little boy. 
CC Boy, he'd make short work of them. 
LMP-LM Joe, I'll tell you it's also a pretty philosophical 
thought to think that you're riding around out 
here on what is really undisturbed -undisturbed 
everything, you know. If there was someone here, 
way back when sometime, they didn't leave much -
much sign of their whereabouts, but that's an 
interesting thought, too, as you drive around and 
all of a sudden cross your own Rover tracks and 
figure out those are the only ones that have maybe 
have ever been here.

Traverse lay over terrain of extraordinary 


geologic diversity and yielded a far greater 
variety of information than ever obtained on 
any other lunar traverse. Systematic 
descriptions and samples of four of the six 
main units of the area, massif, subfloor, the 


light mantle, and the dark mantle were obtained. 
In addition, detailed descriptions were given 
of a variety of craters, including exciting 


discoveries that the crater Shorty, and 


descriptions of the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and 


lineaments in the hilly terrain. The South 
Massif is composed of two main varieties of 
breccia; blue-gray and tan-gray blocks of 


both varieties were abunSsnt at station 2 up 


on Nansen. I won't go into the geologic 


details on those breccias. But -they then 


found samples of the subfloor unit exposed as 
blocks in the ejecta around larger craters 
that had been partly buried by the dark mantle.

_ouston, this is America. See you tried to come 
in there. 


Yes, Ron. You're loud and clear. 


Okay. I'm just finishing up my fruit cocktail. 


Okay. While you're munching there, let me give you 
a few status reports here. First of all, your RCS 
is hooking right along there 4 percent above the 
Flight Plan line; however, we have some plans for 
that 4 percent, which I'll go over with you later. 
On the oxygen, you've gained a little on it, since 


I was last on anyway. 02 tank i is a little low, 


but it's balanced by tank 3 being a -a little high, 
and tank 2 is right on the redline, so I think they 
all balance out to be about on the redline on the 


Flight Plan line. And they all three balance out 


to be right on the Flight Plan line, as close as 
I can tell. On hydrogen, you're probablyup about 
4 percent in tank l, and the other two are right 
on the line, so you are in good shape there, still. 


Very good. 


Okay, while you're -I've got some words on your 


on your orbit here, which won't require anything writing 
down anything -but for some reason you're 
missing the mascons or something, and your orbit's 
not degrading like we expected it to. It's not 
degrading down into a circular orbit. It's -I 
think it's staying Just about the way it was, and 
so we're looking ahead to a plane change, and 
we're -we're thinking about an extra maneuver 
prior to plane change -about i hour prior to plane 


change on the back side. There was some discussion 
here about what to call that maneuver. Somebody 
wanted to call it a HAM, height adjustment maneuver, 


and someone else said, well that one's already used 
in the rendezvous sequence. Maybe we ought to make 
it "bacon." And even "lox" was was suggested, 
considering the FDOs objected to "bacon" because of 
his religion. So the "lox" was eliminated because 


·we already used that for the S-IVB. 



Tape 102B/2 


CMP How about "mascon adjust?" 


CC Anyway, what the maneuver's going to be -whatever 
we call it -is about ll foot per second RCS burn, 
i hour prior to plane change so that'll be on the 
back side. And, that'll Just about use up your 
RCS overage and put you back on the Flight Plan 
line. That will adjust the height when you get 
around to the plane change, and then the plane 
change will be a little bigger than originally 
planned, showing about B65 feet per second, SPS, 
of course. And, looking at the consumables, that 
will put you down right -right on the rescue red-
line on SPS, so we're still in good shape -consumablewise. 
Further tracking will refine this, 
of course, so we'll have updates on the plan. Any 
questions on that? Over. 
06 09 27 16 CMP No, it sounds like you all thought it out. I 
appreciate your letting me know about that. I 
think -Is the time line worked out good enough 
in there to work in a P41? I guess it does -an 
hour before, huh? 
CC Yes, well -we'll make it. I haven't looked at it 
myself, but we are -FAO has -and I haven't heard 
exactly what needs to be changed, if anything. 
Okay, on the SIM bay. Basically there's nothing 
new to report. And all the people down here appreciate 
your timely operation of the SIM bay, 
and it's responsible for really maximizing the 
data return. In general, we're pretty happy. The 
problems that we're have -having with it are 
ones that have already been mentioned to you. On 
the -on the HF antenna retract problem that we 
have, if we have it, here's the plan. We're -
Well, first of all, the consensus on that is that 
we really think the antennas are retracting okay. 
That it's a malfunction in the limit switch that 
drives the talkback that's really the problem. So 
we have devised an alternate method, utilizing 
timing and stall current, and actually the signature 
of the motor stall current down here in the 
data, to determine proper retraction. And just 
prior to 168 hours in the Flight Plan, you're 
supposed to retract those antennas, and we're 
going to check the data at that time, and say 


Tape 102B/3 
"yes" or "no"; they are retracting or they aren't. 
If they don't, then the alternate plan we'll swing 
into at that time is to reschedule the HF targets 
that are now scheduled on rev 55Reschedule 
them 
and do them on rev 42. After which, we'll try one 
more time to retract the antennas, and if it still 
looks like they indeed are not retracting -I guess 
it's Just the one that's in question -then we'll 
go ahead and jettison them at that time. And we'll 
still have gotten most of the -of the least -
priority HF targets with that alternate plan. Over.

it's been -just rain erosion down the side and it 
kind of washes little -little valleys down it here 
and there. And it leaves mounds and humps in between 
that haven't eroded away yet. And that's the 
way the side of that crater works. And then the 
other side of it, the northeastern rim of it and 
the interior rim, looks just like a -a -one of

there's a crater that's about -well, it's right 
at the end of those rilles that go north from 
Sulpicius Gallus. And you can really see the 
eJecta blanket. The eJecta blanket looks very 
dark, around it now in this Sun. Now you look 
out across the Mare Serenitatis now and you're 
getting toward the sunset, looking back into the 


Sun, and the color is disappearing all except in 


that one spot. Now that must be a -either a

Oh, okay. That's right. Okay. That's right, 
these are Just short sounder passes now, aren't 
they? 


That's right. 


Ron, I can finish up my description of the last 
night's EVA if you like since nothing to look at 
now. I'm watching the clock on the sounder start 


for you, 


Okay; hey, appreciate it. 


Okay, think I left off, or was cut off there 
without mentioning two varieties of breccia in the 


South Massif. They found blue-gray and tan-gray 


and, without going into the geological details, 
those are the two types they found up there at 
Nansen. The subfloor unit was exposed as blocks 


and eJecta around larger craters had been partly 
buried by dark mantle. And craters apparently had 
penetrated thin parts of the light mantle. Espe


cially good samples were obtained from the rim of 
Camelot where the same textural characteristics 
which are banding caused by variations in vesicle 
concentration, coarse-grain size, and mineralogic 
features, as reported in EVA-l, were found. So 
apparently this unit is quite uniform over the 
distances that they have covered so far in the 
traverses. The prominent east-facing scarp, 


crossing the valley floor from north to south about 


5 kilometers west of the LM, was traversed twice 
near the crater Lara, near Hole-in-the-Wall, al-
although Hole-in-the-Wall appeared to be pretty 


subtle. No change in the surface characteristics 
or lithology of the mantle was discernible where 
the astronauts traversed the Scarp. Outcrops of 



Tape 102B/ll 


boulders were observed farther to the north where 
the northward extension of the Scarp crosses the 
face of the North Massif, it forms a notably 
smooth and relatively young-appearing surface. 
Elsewhere, the surface of the North Massif is 
prominently furrowed and textured, and the crew 
described it as a cross-hatched pattern on the 
surface that they could see with one set of lineaments 
dipping eastward and the other westward at 
about 30 degrees. Some of the most interesting 
observations made during the EVA were related to 
craters. Many small craters within the dark mantle 
have glass-coated central pits. Jack called them 
dimples. Some of the pits are nearly cylindrical 
and mayb e half again as deep as the crater itself. 
Other small craters occurring in both the dark and 
light mantle have bright halos, but these halos 
appear to be noticeably brighter on the light-
colored material. This bright material is not 
blocky or fragmental eJecta derived from a subfloor 
layer, but rather appears to consist of "instant 
rock" or soil breccia which has been partly consolidatedby 
the impact shock itself. The most 
interesting eureka during the EVA was at station 4, 
Shorty Crater, where Jack found some bright red or 
orange, he described it, orange dirt within the 
gray to dark-gray rim material. The colored bandlng 
is circumferential to the crater and resembled 
alteration halos, which occur around many terrestrial 
volcanic vents. So you can see why the 
geologists are excited on that one. The morphology 
of Shorty, however, is similar in some respects --
06 l0 09 20 CMP You bet you. 
CC --impact craters have definitive interpretation 
of its origin msy depend on sample analysis. And 
I got about a,minute and a half to start the sounder. 
It might be close to 02:B0 there, if you aren't. 
They took a total of about 850 pictures. They've 
taken a total of 1270, would you believe, pictures 
... on the lunar surface. Including about 
150 with the 500-millimeter camera mostly of the 
North, South, East Massifs, and Family Mountain. 
They got 56 samples, two double cores, probably 
about 36 kilograms worth, and they traveled a 
total distance of 20 kilometers. Over.

Hey, sounds like a good s_lmm_ry. They're finding 


all kinds of things up there. Which is the reason 


you explor, I guess, to find -to see what you can

itself anyhow, 


Roger. 


Maybe the lunar sounder will collaborate my moon


light investigations here -or earthlight investi


gations, I'm sorry. 


(Laughter) 


While we're waiting here -I decided to sleep last 


night without being tied down or anything. So I 


slept in the old -What do you call them in the 


Navy? 


Hammocks, I think. 


Well, anyhow, sleeper strings, we call them up 


here. Yes, sleeping bags -or some kind of sack. 


And the last 2 or 3 nights, what I'd do is put 


the lap belt on loosely. And you know, it Just 


kind of keeps you from rolling all over the cockpit. 
Then last night, I didn't put it on at all and 
stayed in the sack. And I really didn't go too far 


anyhow. One time I woke up and I was crossways in 


the couch up here. And then when I woke up this 



? 
Tape 102B/13 
morning my feet were up in the tunnel, and my head 
was kind of still in the center couch, more or less. 
So you really don't roam around too much that way 
anyhow, even if you aren't tied down. And you can 
get the "huggy pillow" effect by being inside that 
sack and laying your head on the outside of the 
sack. It Just about fits me, except that if I 
stretch my feet out -then I get a little bit of 
a pull. Little bit of a pull -on it and it feels 
like a huggy pillow that way. 
CC Kind of a security blanket effect, huh? 
CMP (Laughter) Yes, right. That was the biggest 
problem the first 2 or 3 days here -what do you 
do with your head when you go to sleep. I'm used

that you can get from -for me it's hard to

on TV. The only thing new on the peace talks is 
that Kissinger will probably be coming back to the 


United States today and there's a rumor, the French 


press said that the compromise is in the work on 
the withdrawal of the North Vietnamese troops from 
the south. The Rockets lost -the Aeros, the 
hockey team, won last night. They beat the Alberta 


Oilers. The Rockets lost to Buffalo. And the 
weather finally cleared out. The cold front cleared

Hey, Ron I'm not suggesting you do, because it's 
probably trouble to find. Have you tried the 
color wheel, comparing it on any of this stuff? 


(Laughter) No, I haven't. Let me try. That's a 
good idea, though. I'll try that and see what I 
can come up with on that thing.

I was trying

could add to the Reiner Gamm_ observation there.

type of m_terial that goes perpendicular between 


Reiner and Reiner Gammm. It's kind of a crooked 


type -Well, you know, it goes for a little ways, 
and then it breaks off into a dark-albedo-type 
stuff; and then breaks off in another direction a 
little bit. So, it doesn't look like a straight 
ray at all. 


Roger. 


Youknow -you can see crater holes, and this type 
of thing. You look right down on Reiner now, 
you've sure got that dark annulus -the lighteralbedo-
type stuff is essentially in the middle of 
it. And the annulu s is -let's see, maybe 30 kilometers 
wide by twice as long -that's a relative 
size, anyhow -by twice as long, and that's the 
dark area. And then around that, the light albedo 
stuff is about half of the width, and it's lighter 


on the outside than it is on the inside. The inside 
is not quite as light as the -I'd call it 
the rim, I guess. It's very hard to see any -

to run the same operation, since it went so smoothly 
down here. We hope it went that way for you up

things down there -that you -that you kind of Frankly,

that way in the Flight Plan, we'll probably just 
stand by right straight through on rev 40 where you 
-you pick up at the landing site and go right

06 13 46 34 CDR-LM I want you to say it first. 


CC 
Hello there, Challenger. The Gold Team Flight 
Director picked out the morning's selection, and 
he said that if can find some maroon dirt, today, 
instead of orange, you'll probably get a lot more 
cooperation out of him. 


CDR-LM 
I figured the Gold Team might do that. You know, 
I've woke up to a lot of pleasant thoughts, but 
never to an Aggie before. 


CDR-LM 
Hey, Gordo, don't forget I'm a gold -I'm a 
Boilermaker. 


CC 
Roger. 


CDR-LM 
I feel like one right now. Tell the Gold Team 
Flight Director we'll find about -Just about 
anything he wants today. 


CC 
Okay; I'll do that. The Challenger looks as good 
as ever. No problems at all through the night. 


CDR-LM 
That's outstanding. How's America? 


CC 
It's in the same shape. Just clicking along. 
Ron's been up for a few hours now and really 
gathering up the data. 


CDR-LM 
Outstanding, Gordo. 


CC 
Challenger, the name of the game today is to stay 
with the -the EVA prep time line. We're not 
going to talk much to you -We'd like -except to 
bug you a little and stay on your back to keep

That's affirmative. Although, if you stay on the 


normal time line, that's fine with us. We don't 
need to gain any, but we just don't want to lose 
any -from where we're starting now. 


Yes. Understand. Understand. 


Good. How are you this morning? 


Houston, Challenger. 


Go ahead, Challenger. 


Okay, Gordy. Crew status is good, in case you 


hadn't noticed. And again I'm not going to -We 
haven't kept an itemized accounting of the food burning 
up blanks on the paper to do that. But 
we have ate -have eaten, pardon me -We have 
eaten Just about everything in the various meals. 
I guess the shrimp was the only thing we didn't 
really eat. And we've been drinking a lot of 
water and all the juices and tea and stuff, so I 
thinkwe're in pretty good shape there. The

That's a good question. Let's see here. We're

ago on rev 37. 


Okay. 


Gordy, we're pressing on, but if you've got any 
good words, like news and what have you, where 
we are, we'd appreciate it. 


Okay. There hasn't been a lot of news, but I'll 
read you what we've got. President -former 
President Trmnan is still holding on. His heartbeat, 
breathing, and temperature all became 
unstable yesterday, but then he improved again. A 
Methodist minister in Kansas City said, "He's a 
rugged guy who's hanging in there and he's going 
to make it." The headlines were full of reports 
of the find of orange dirt and the rest of your 
adventures yesterday. Internationally, the U.S. 
and North Vietnam held intensified secret peace 
talks, and Henry Kissinger prepared to return to 


Washington probably this afternoon, I understand, 
after a final session with Le Duc Tho. The French 


press said a compromise was in the works on the 
withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from the 


South. The Houston Rockets lost to Buffalo up in 
Buffalo last night, but the hockey team, the Aeros, 
took a 6 to 4 win over the Alberta Oilers. In 


Really, that's about it on the news, except maybe 
for the weather, which finally broke. The cold 
front cleared out the drizzly rain last night, 
and for the first time since you've launched that 
I can remember anyway -we've been able to 


look up and see the Moon, directly. It's a pretty 
sight as always. That's not much of a report, 


but that's about all we have. Over. 


Okay; thank you. What's the date today? 


It's Wednesday -let's see -Wednesday, the 13th 
of December. 


Thank you. 


Right now, it's about 01:35 in the afternoon. 



Tape 106A/4 
CDR-LM Okay; just take a quick peek up there. I can't 
really see too much of the North American 
continent. South America looks pretty good. And 
it might be my eyeballs rather than the -the 
clouds up there, but it looks like most of the 
clouds are up into the north-central part of the 
southwestern or southeastern United States. 
CC I have a satellite picture here, and that's about 
the way it looks. 
CDR-LM Well, it's sunny and pleasant on the valley of 
Taurus-Littrow. And, Gordo, what is our Sun angle 
going out today? 
CC I'll get you an answer on that. Couple of 
questions. First of all, the Surgeon would like a 
biomed rate. And they were wondering how your 
hands feel this morning? 
CDR-LM Hands are in good shape, Gordo. No problem. 
CC Okay; that sounds good. Sun is getting up there 
about 33 degrees now. 
06 14 06 22 CDR-LM Okay; we'll go a mild midleft, and both PLSSs air 
have been topped off. 
CDR-LM Gordy, the _ isn't hooked up right now, He will 
be shortly. So standby on the biomed. 
CC Okay. Okay; I have a few words on the command 
module trajectory that might be of interest, 
although it doesn't affect your procedures any. 
CDR-LM Go ahead. 
CC Okay. The com -the command module orbit somehow 
is missing all the mascons. It's not de -
degrading into a circular like we thought _t 
would. It's just staying where it was, about a 
70 by 50. And so what we're planning on is an 
extra little maneuver about i hour prior to the 
normal plane change, which will lower the command 
module altitude at the plane change mode to -
to 60. This will be about a il-feet-per-second 


Tape 106A/5 
RCS burn. And then Ron will do the plane change 
at the normal time, but it'll be little bigger 
than -that we had planned. I think the last half 
was about 365 feet per second for plane change. 
And we've checked the consumables. That puts the 
RCS right on the preflight line. He's been running 
about 4 or 5 percent above it. That will use up 
that pad there, put him back to nor -nominal on 
RCS, and on the SPS, that puts you right down on 
the CSM rescue redline; so, really no problem. 
In good shape, consumablewise. Over.

sample bag holder on my camera. It's taped on 
there pretty well with good tape, believe it or 
not, off the fruit bag. I -I don't know that we 
have any other outstanding hardware problems. I 
think in terms of sampling, Gene and I will try 
to shift the emphasis in the mantle area to 
fragments that are different from the gabbros that 
we've sampled fairly well, I think, up to now, 
that presumably are subfloor materials. You might 
pass that word on and see if they agree with us. 
CC Okay, Jack. We copy that. And, Jack, if you guys 
are at a convenient place, sit and listen while 
you're doing some of your stuff. Let me read up 
the planning for EVA 3 and the s,_-,_aryof what we 
think we have so far. 
LMP-LM Go ahead. 
06 14 45 26 CC Okay. I'll read here from this thing Just 
verbatim. It says, "EVA 3 continues to follow 
essentially the nominal premission plan. Main 
objectives continue to be the North Massif; 
station 6, 7; Sculptured Hills; and Van Serg 
Crater. In view of the extensive observations of 
the dark mantle and main -and plains subfloor 
unit on EVA i and 2, particularly there before 
station 5, the relatively -the relative priority 
of station l0 is reduced, so that station l0 
becomes a flexible station as time allotment is a 
reserve, possibly providing more time at the 
earlier station, if desired. However, mantle and 


Tape 106A/7 


block sampling at station l0 are still important 
objectives. Block pack constraints are not nearly 
as tight as they were yesterday, guys, and so we 
can be more flexible in reshuffling station times 


if we need. We probably won't be coming up against 
option walkbacks like we did at station _. 
Closeout time at the IA{has been increased by 


20 minutes to make the closeout less rushed and 


to allow for potential ALSEP troubleshooting. 
It is currently plannedto take this time from 
station 6, 7."

Very good. 


Ron, we've got one change to the Flight Plan. We 


should have got it to you sooner. At 163:40, we 


want to change that VERB 49 maneuver, because we 
want the lunar sounder to look at the SEP at the 
landing site.

APOLLO 17 AIR-T0-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION 


I 


06144627 CC 
Butif6/7 requires more time when we get there, 
we can borrow it from one of the other stations; 
I guess, in particular, station 10, probably. 
As the initial activity then, we are going to 
have to take explosive package 5 with us, and 
we'll stick it under the LMP seat, and I'll 
remind you in real time when we get down on the 
ground on that one. And number 5, 3 pound, will 
be deployed at station 10, and again I'll remind 
you about that in real time, so don't -you 
don't have to bother to write it in on your 
checklist. Planned traverse proceeds as normal. 
We're expecting to spend about an hour and 


20 minutes at stations 6 and 7, and the suggestion 
is that we may end up wanting to spend 
that totally at the split boulder at station 6, 
hut, of course, the option still exists to visit 
more than one place and sample other boulders if 


it seems feasible and attractive and desirable. 
They are suggesting additional 500-millimeter 
photographs, especially if it seems that we can 
use those to document tracks and sources of 


docu -of the sampled boulders; for instance, 
at stations 6 and 7. We are continuing to hold 
the nominal 47 minutes at station 8 -that is, 
8A, and we still think that's as good a place 
as any to sample the Sculptured Hills. Station 9 
is still nominal 30 minutes, but in view of the 
similarities to the in -to station 4, we're 


anticipating a possible desirability to remove 
time from station 10 to enlarge station 9, but 
that will have to be a real-time decision, 
based upon what we find at station 9. Station 47 
-station 10 continues nominal. We're still 
interested in sampling the blocks and also 
interested in -in trenching to try and see if 
we can say something about the dark mantle light 
area relationship and, perhaps, the nominal 
coring. We're going to -we're going to deploy 
EP 5there; and, other than that, they're basically 
the same. If we have the time during that 
closeout, and you'll know if we have enlarged 
the closeout somewhat, of the LM, based on our 
experience the last two nights, particularly for 
dusting; but also, if time permits, in that time 



Tape 107A/2 
we might try and get the -use up the extra 
double core, if there is one, in the dark mantle 
near the I_Mor do some trenching near the I/4. 
But that's only if time permits at the very end, 
depending upon how the consumables run out. They 
want to call attention to two particular things 
here. One, since you guys really haven't gotten 
any very big rocks so far, they're recommending, 
they say here, and I quote: "The value of large 
individual samples has been demonstrated. We 
recommend that several football-sized samples of 
a uniform igneous rock be collected at station 9 
or 10." I'll pass that on as that. Another 
point of interest is the l-to 20-millimeter 
size section of the regolith, the dark mantle, 
the lithology. Then, any observations or collections 
you can make pertinent to that would be of 
interest in trying to determine the relationship 
of the dark mantle to the subfloor units of 
gabbro underneath. Two short questions which 
I'll ask, which I hope -hope you can answer in 
just a very few words. One of them is a yes 
and no answer. One, we -they can't find the 
geophone photos specifically called out in the 
transcript. There is probably a little bit of 
garble at that point, and the people in the 
back room will be very happy if you could say 
once and for all, Jack, that, yes, you did get 
the geophone photos. Over. 
06 14 50 03 IJMP-LM Yes. 
CC Roger. And the second one concerns the 1/4-pomld 
charge which we deployed on the way in last nigjlt. 
Two questions on that. It appears to us from 
your voice transcript that we weren't fast enough 
on it at the time that that may be deployed closer 
to the _T.qEP than the one you deployed on the way 
out. And we'd like an impression on that. And, 
number 2, you mentioned that you placed it in a 
depression. We'd like some feeling for that 
depression in terms of how much of a danger tiu_t 
bomb -charge might play to the A_EP when it _oe_; 
off. If it's in a depression of any sort, thcy':._ 
I probably pretty well protecting the A1S].:P. Any 
comment on those two questions? Over. 


Tape 107A/3 
06 14 50 47 CDR-LM Well, the second one. It's not in a major depression. 
But it is a -maybe a -it's a little 
ditch, maybe a third of a meter deep. I imagine 
it will help a little bit. That's why we picked 
it. Just a second. 
LMP-LM I'm not sure 
very much. 
we understand your first question 
CC Okay. We have a feeling that when you --
CDR-LM Bob, don't you have the mileages? 
CC Roger. But there's again some confusion on that. 
CDR-LM Can't you -can't you pinpoint that? 
CC Yes, and those mileages also seem to indicate 
that we had that callout. Remember, you drove 
back by and you said you saw the flag, and then 
you said you actually saw the charge inself first. 
And it was some time after that you said you 
deployed the charge. And we have the opinion 
from both that and the mileage that you probably 
deployed the second charge closer to the ALSEP 
than the first one. Do you have a -any sort of 
a feel for that? 
06 14 51 43 CDR-LM Oh, yes. I remember saying that, but that's when 
I did a big 360, and Jack was out of film. And 
I just lined up to take that picture with him up 
in the background. And when I said, hey, I saw 
the charge first. I was really -Don't take that 
comment too strong. 
CC Okay. Copy that. 
CDR-LM As far as position of it, Bob, I -I -we're 
looking for them out there now. As a matter 
fact, we can't see them from here. 
of 
CC Okay. We'll let it go at that. And that's all 
the questions and comments we have on today's 
traverse. We'll have a few real-time things on 
the surface, which I won't bother you with. A

possible fix to the surface electrical properties 
and a possible trip back to the surface gravimeter, 
which is still having its problems. But I'll talk 
with you guys in real time on those when you get 
on the surface, rather than bothering you with 


them now. 


Hey, Bob. How far should that last charge be 
from the ALSEP? 


They want it about 300 to 400 meters. 


And, Gene, you ... 0.2 for range when -


Bob, I ...-


--... got back to the LM. And I guess the 
question would be, Did you ever go through zero 
on the way back to the ImM? If you are at O. if 
you were at 0.2, and we think 9 -092 was the 
bearing, then the LM is right where we thought 
it was, and we were just a little confused by 
our distances. Just doesn't quite -they don't 
quite hold together. 


No, Idon't think I ever went through zero, because 
I initiated at the SEP. 


Okay. 


And, no, I didn't go through zero. 


Okay. 


I'm positive. 


We copy that. Okay. We'll work on that. 


Is this something to think -Yes, this is something 
to think about. It's not that far out 
there. You know, if there is any question about 
that damaging the ALSEP, it -it's Ju_t hard 
for us to recall how close they were. And wt_ 
sort of thought you had them pinpointed i'orus. 
But, if you want it 3 to 400 meters, you might 


think about a late ... -



Tape 107A/5 
cC No. We thought about that. We don't -we don't 
want to do that. No, we don't want to do that. 
So we'll take care of it. Don't worry about it 
now. That's all we have. Press on with the prep. 
LMP-LM Bob, I can -Hey, Bob; this is Jack. I can see 
the charge with the binocular. It's out almost 
behind a rock that's between us and the LM, but 
I can see it. I (laughter) -I mean, a rock between 
it and the LM. I can't give you any idea, 
though, how far it is. 
CC Okay. 
06 14 54 54 LMP-LM No, it's the one off to the left. It's the ... Hey, 
Bob. Let me say again, I think we ought to 
emphasize the exotic looking fragments on the 
dark mantle. And we ought to try to make sure 
that we look at a variety of rocks from the North 
Massif. I think we saw the major rock types on 
the South Massif yesterday, but we really didn't 
spend a lot of time ranging along the front there 
to verify that completely. The other comment on 
the 1-to 20-millimeter size fraction. There isn't 
an awful lot of that in the dark mantle. That's 
one of the striking things about it. 
CC Okay. Copy that. And we'll talk --
LMP-LM But we'll keep our eyes open. 
CC --I'll talk with the back room about stations 6 
and 7. We'll get with you on that when you get 
there. And press on. 
06 14 57 38 LMP-LM Houston, Challenger. I was BIOMED, RIGHT, there 
for about l0 minutes, in case you're curious. 
CC Okay, Jack. And it looked good. 
CDR-LM Okay, Bob. I've got them both. And the last one 
we deployed, which I think is the eastern one -
easternmost one, is definitely farther out than 
the first one we deployed. And you know, at this 
distance, it's awful hard by looking at Jack's 
geophones. What's your -I got to give you at

like on the hills and all around the landing site. 


And this first layer goes down maybe -let's see, 


as you look at the total distance in there, about 


a third of the distance; and then the white layer 


concentric layer that goes all the way around, and 


this is in the western wall I'm looking at now, and 


it goes down to -to about a half of the distance, 


not quite half of the distance from the top of the 


rim down to the bottom. And then the lower port_oa 


of it, the lower half, a little better than a half 


really, is kind of a tannish gray -has a tannish-


gray albedo to it. It's all streaked. And close 


to the bottom of the layer, the bottom of the 


crater itself is -filled with -Well, oddly 


enough, it's the same color of material that's 


that's laying around the edges of the crater, it 


has some radial rings around it, which gives an 
indication of a subsidence of some kind, or a 
sliding down the hill. _at's really the first

layering in the walls. Now the first layer on the 
north side and also on the south side, in the dark 
brownish layer of the thing, you can see parts that 


are Jagged, Jagged, and sticking out. In other 
words, there's a slight change in slope in it.

would indicate that it's a fairly con -compacted

slope changes in the white layer on down a little 
bit more. And the white layer seems to sort of 
combine and maintain the same type of slope as the

halfway down to the bottom of the crater.

down, isn't it? Okay, Jack, if you're going to 
worry about the SEP, stand by and don't do the SEP

CC Okay. A couple of things on that, Geno. You 
might try tapping the thing to see if that loosens 
the dust. There's also the hook business on the 
inside of the pallet that you could hook it on. 
Caution: if you open the pallet, be careful not to 
knock the clamps off the fender. But you can also 
reach over the pallet to put the big bag on.

it there. 


Yes. And in case you're wondering, and so you 


don't confuse it with a rock, it's in bag 106. 


Copy that. 


Okay. What 
do you want done to the SEP? 


Okay. Take some gray tape over to the receiver, 


Gene. And with reference to the fact that the 


there is some Velcro missing on the front there 


which hold the covers down, we'd like to tape the 
two covers together -on the -in the middle 
there -you know, where the two -two sides overlap 
in the middle of the box. Tape those two 
together. A short piece about an inch long should 


do it if they are clean. 


Well, I doubt if the tape will stick because ..., 
but I might be able to go over it with one piece 


to clean it and another piece to tape it. 


Okay. Andthe question beyond that, is there 


Velcro to hold one of those flaps down or not? 


No. 


Okay, so both pieces -the Velcro is missing from 
both flaps, I take it. 


Yes. 



Tape 108A/29 
LMP-EVA Bob, what happened was that the tape that held 
the lower Velcro on there apparently came loose, 
and it stuck to the upper Velcro. 
CC Okay. I understand that. In that case, we'd like 
to take a piece of tape and tape the cover down to 
keep it closed when it's not -when it's supposed 
to be closed. The feeling is that if the cover 
flaps partly open, you may get specular reflection 
off the inside of the Mylar down onto the mirrors 
causing it to heat up during the drive when it's 
supposed to be closed. 
CDR-EVA Okay, we'll give it a try.

might go rescue EP number 5 from the footpad, and 
we'll put it under the LMPs seat.

LMP-EVA I said I got -Bob, I -Go ahead.

LMP seat. Did you re-sort things there? 
LMP-EVA Do you want -how do you want them? 


Tape 108A/31 
CC It doesn't matter to us. I just wanted to make 
sure that we know what you are so we don't let 
you get away too far with two uppers and a lower. 
Two lowers and an upper is certainly better than 
two uppers and a lower. As long as we know what 
it is.

Okay, I-

I gave you a mark when I started and it took about 
20 seconds to get to the end. 


Okay, copy that. 


Is that good enollgh or do you want me to go back? 


No. No. Press on. And, Jack, if you look at 
your contour map there, we think you are located 
right now at approximately where the P in SEP is, 
Just below the P in Poppy. In which case you're 
probably driving through that little crater that's 


Just to the northeast there. 


Okay. 


That's probably the one you came upon. 


Not very little, though. 


Okay, Bob. Boy, I wish I could see a little bit 
better. 


The major boulders still look like the -the 
pyroxene gabbro. Surface texture has not changed. 
There is a -there is a granule population, now 
that I look at it more closely, with the shadows. 
But I have a feeling that most of those are they 
look like they're just small, very small clods. 
That should show up in some of the bulk samples 
we've taken. It is remarkable to me the -only a 
small number of fine-grain rocks. There's one at 
about halfway between the SEP and the LM that I'd 
like to pick up, it's a fairly good sized one. 
Maybe we can get it when we get back. It looks like 
a fine-grained basalt. I may have sampled one in

It's not an exceptionally blocky rim crater, but 
we are in an area where the block population is 
up to about 5 percent in contrast to most of the 
area we traversed yesterday. 
CDR-EVA I tell you, going is a little bit rough; there's 
a population of blocks as Jack said and there is 
an awful lot of small craters. 
LMP-EVA Yes, I was just going to add that the frequency 
of craters in the 10-meter size range is quite a 
bit higher than we were used to yesterday. Oops, 
there's one.

Okay, Bob, looking up at the North Massif, we see 


the scattered, strewn field of boulders, that 
generally seem to start from a -more or less, 


from a line of large boulders, which might indicate 
some structure. And those lines are roughly 
horizontal across the face that we're looking at. 
The boulder tracks are irregular in shape, obviously 
downhill, but you'll see in the pictures 
that they -that they are curved in places but 
they're all -that I see -tend to be aggregates 


of little craters -where the boulder was obviously 
tumbling and bouncing a little bit. We're

188/0.9. 


It's generally about i percent between craters. 
But at the crater rims, it's up to about 5 percent. 


Okay. Copy that, Jack. And how far down the 
North Massif -


And these craters -


--is the line of boulders? 



Tape 108A/4B 
LMP-EVA Oh, there are several of them, Bob. What I'm 
talking about is about 100-meter-long lines where 
the boulder trains initiate and they are -there's 
one about -looks like about halfway -maybe 
two-thirds of the way down in perspective. 
Another one that's probably about halfway -they're 
Just sort of scattered around on the Massif.

be.

CDR-EVA Where are you looking? 
LMP-EVA Off to the right.

in there, but I think those lines of boulder 
sources are about all we can see right now. Talked 
about the lineaments yesterday and they're not nearly 
as obvious today in the higher Sun. Looking up 
Wessex Cleft -even with the Sun in the flat area 
there, it looks darker than where -that North

fooling us but I recall it was darker on the photos.

the side of Sculptured Hills, except that they 
aren't nearly as big as those on the North Massif.

to several meters. Those boulder sources all seem 
to be up within a third of the height of the

Sculptured Hills, in terms of sampling opportuni


ties of station 8 and in terms of any boulder 


tracks that we might -might lead down to boulders 


that might just possibly be accessible at sta


tion 8. 


Roger, Gene. Boulder tracks are not obvious on 


Sculptured Hills at all. It looks like there are 


fragments over there that would have had their 


sources higher up the slope. I think we can get 


boulders there.

And on up the hill you have ... 


But as I was 
saying, Henry Just looks like some

be ridiculous.

get around the western rim of Henry. 


Okay. 


And on that west rim, we've got about l0 or l0 
percent boulder cover. 


Okay, And a reminder, Jack, to keep taking your

Yes, sir. And when I -By boulder, I generally 
mean fragment, Bob, in this case. When I say 
l0 percent, I'm looking at stuff greater than 
about a centimeter in diameter. I'll try to say 
fragment from now on and be more precise. Okay. 
Here's a little area where there's -This part of 
Henry -this is the one part of the rim of Henry 
I see that has fairly large fragments, or boulders, 
on them up to 2 or 3 meters. But, again, they 
all appear to be buried. There are very few,

ones, sitting out on the surface.

And, you know, the fragment population out here 


only goes out to maybe 200 meters, I expect.

of a 50-meter crater in the rim of Henry. 


Okay, say that sounds like a lot ... -I

rim crest of Henry, almost due -the west rim 


due west rim. Now Locke is just ahead of us. It 
also has boulders in its walls but has relatively 
few on the rim. 

Okay. Copy that. 


Characteristic of both Henry, Locke, and Horatio 
is are -essentially no change in the average 


frequency of boulders on the rim. The increase 


comes in the wall. 


We're at 184/2.3. We're Just about between Henry

Locke.

I'm going to take a tour around that boulder and 


get a case on it. 


Okay. Go ahead. 


Yes. That would be a good mark to give us a range 
and bearing on, since that's a pretty good straight 
point. 


Yes, we are. 


Bob, the boulder concentrations in the wall of 


Henry have their upslope start at about -oh, I 
would guess an average of 30 meters down from the 
rim crest. The rim crest of Henry is not very 


well defined, but it's there. And they -from 
that initiation of boulders, they stream down the 
slope to the break in -in slope down at the floor. 
Still no obvious change in the dark mantle, as 
we're just to the east of Locke now. There's 
some -there's a 30-meter crater, fairly subdued 
but still quite deep -subdued rim. Again, it 


looks as if it were mantled; that -has no significant 
increase in blocks on its rim. That 


crater, in any other place, would have been a very 
blocky-rim crater. It has -its maybe 30 meters 
and-by 5 meters deep. Man, that is a big rock 


up there. Turning Point Rock is a split rock has 
a -looks like a northwest-southeast overhang, 
with another block just this side of it -Just to 


the south of that overhang. It's a pyramid shape 
in cross section -triangular shape in cross section. 
And it looks like it is pretty well fractured, 
although not pervasively like the rock at 
Shorty was. 


Okay, Jack, I know I can get up to that -to 
station 6. 


Yes. 


I might drive up there. 


Yes. Now, Bob, station 6 rock -one of them 


is from that boulder track that runs obliquely

here that has been knocked off up there, from right 
on top of the boulder. And, I tell you, the more 


I look at this -the south half of this boulder, 
the more heterogeneous in texture it looks. It 
looks as if it may be either a recrystallized 
breccia of some kind, or you had a gabbroic 


anorthosite -magma catch up an awful lot of 
inclusions. I guess I prefer the latter explanation 
because of the extreme vesicularity of the 


rock. 


Okay; very interesting.

anorthositic gabbro, if I didn't say that. Some

We want to get a rake on the rim of that little 
crater down there, I guess. 


Okay, 17. Roger. You were asking about objectives. 
Of course the primary objective is docu -documented 
samples of the blocks; and then, also, we'd like 
to get some of the rake and soil sample out in the 
surface, namely, the rim crater there, if that's 
available. And one of the things, of course, we're 
looking for is the variety of rocks here, if there's 
more than Just the one boulder. You can sample the 
boulder for awhile, but we would be interested in 
seeing if there is more than Just the single type 
of rock. Probably, also, samples from both sides both 
halves of the rock. What we said this morning

and 20 minutes 


Come on up here, Geno. 


Okay.

you spend here and how much you go on to station 7 
and spend. If you feel that it's worthwhiie, we 
could spend essentially all that hour and 20 minutes 
at this station. But if we did that, we'd 
like to get a fair variety of blocks, if they're 
available.

with the very vesicular anorthositic gabbro -

think this whole big blue-gray thing is an 


inclusion? 


Yes, sir. And there's some little ones over here. 


Yeah, but then within the blue-gray, we've got 
all these other fragment. 


Well, that's right. It's Just several generations 


of activity; and it looks like the gabbor though, 
picked up the fragmental breccia as inclusion. 
Bob, I'd-it really looks that way right now. 


There's a -


Okay, Charlie is here mumbling something about it 


looking Just like house rock [?]. 


It's very crystalline. I'll tell you, it's not 


a breccia -not like house rock [?]. Not to take 


anything away from house rock [?], though. 


Hey, Bob, there's a lot of mantling on a very 


shallow slope of a fracture here on one of the 


upslope rocks. I would assume it's just part of 


the ... picked up as its rolled down. But if it's 
worth sampling, you might think about it. 


Okay, Gene, if you can get that fairly readily, 


why don't you -You can perhaps Just scoop it up 


with the bag. 


That's exactly what I can do. 


If you can get up to the rock there.

Bob, most of them are -Let

them are an inch or so or smaller. They're 
angular to subrounded fragments. Some of them 
look like the inclusions. As a matter of fact, 
the ones that are broken open look like some of 
the light-colored inclusions we saw in the big 
boulder. The others are too dust covered to say 
anything about. 


A couple of them look fairly coarsely crystalline.

a rough handle on where you thought you saw some 


of the coloring differentiation up on the northern 


side of Shorty -and also give some thought on 


F Crater, if you will. I know you didn't get a 


chance to look at it because -If we can tie up the what

have something here, as far as matching up on some

And -but we're away from the block population

ahead of us, this side of the SWP Crater. And 


but the average population is down to the i percent 
or less, again. 


That average population really never changed up 
in here. Just the big blocks were around. I 
saw some little -

Hey, Houston. This is a -about a 50-50 mixture 
of -what looks like maskelynite or at least blue-
gray plagioclase, and a very -let's say yel -light 
yellow-tan mineral, probably orthopyroxene. It 's 
fairly coarsely crystalline. 


Copy that. Okay. When you guys get done with that 
rock, we'd like to get to the rake sample, please. 
And that's probably Just as well done by the Rover 
as anyplace else. We don't seem to see anything 
worthwhile here doing besides that.

see, we're cutting into your eat period, and you're

short. So, right at wakeup, while you're working, 
you might be considering getting eat things ready

you're doing you postsleep check and that, you 
might be getting some food out. You're going to be 
busier than the proverbial one-armed paperhanger 


there. 


Okay. That's 
probably a good idea (chuckle). 


And we wanted that up to you so that you might get 
a chance to look at it this evening or the rest of 
this rev and make some thoughts or pull your thoughts 
together on that burn in the morning and see if 
we've covered all bets. 


Okay. So far it looks pretty good here. We'll have 


some different high gain angles there at 181:00. 
And you're going to give those up anyhow. 


Okay, at 181:00 -


You can send those up with the -well, for the next 
A0S there. 


Yes.We see that. Okay. We'll have to be calling 
that up to you tomorrow as you go around, I guess.

Bob, what I'm looking at is the -northwest portion 
of Gatsby, where there's a very very concentrated 
block field on the inner wall, except where there 


are, on the southwest, three stream_ and on the 
northwest and north a continuous stream, if you 


will, on band, radial band, of mantle that is 
bur -appears to be burying that field, overlying 
and mantling the field. We got some pretty pictures 
of it, I think. 

Okay. Copy that. 


Bob, I'm more and more convinced there's a mantle. 
One possibility, I guess, is that, if it's a 
pyroclastic mantle, that in the lunar vacuum 


environment and with whatever volatiles we're 
dealing with, the stuff becomes extremely fine 
upon vesiculation. We may have been on it all 


the time and not known it -as far as recognizing 
it. 


As soon as we come through this draw, ... smooth or 
free of any debris or boulders it is on the other 
side of the upslope. 


Yes. Watch it. 


Bob, do we have an extra EP? 


No. We have two of them behind you. We're going 
to deploy -we're going to deploy one. I'll give 
you a reading soon on that. 


Okay. Well, one -one I deploy at the end I know. 
I thought we had an extra one here somewhere. 


Okay. Yes, that's what I -Okay, that's the one 
we were planning on deploying all along, and 
it's there. We'll be deploying at a range of 0.1, 
which is Just before you get to the SEP.

maybe the gray relatively nonvesicular subfloor 
may be deeper -deeper fraction, based on what 
we saw -well, actually, though, let's see -that 


could have been overturn, I don't know. Take

there at Van Serg that I saw subfloor, but we 
never did sample any that I know of. And the 
dust was thick enough that I'm Just not sure. 
Breccias were the most obvious thing there. 
Okay. Most interesting. 
It might have been a window in the plains here, of 
some kind. But -it's strange to see it there,

didn't lose it (laughter) any earlier. If we 
were going to lose it, that couldn't have been 
more ideal. 
LMP-EVA Yes. That was appropriate, I guess. 
CDR-EVA We got two -we've got two empty core tubes. 
Feel like we took a lot of them, though.

LMP-EVA 
Yes. How about over here? 


CDR-EVA 
I'll put it right over here aginst that back background. 


06 23 03 ll CDR-EVA Houston, before we close out our EVA, we understand 
that there are young people in Houston today, who 
have been effectively touring our country, young 
people from countries all over the world, respectively, 
touring our country. They had the opportunity 
to watch the launch of Apollo 17, hopefully 
had an opportunity to meet some of our young people 
in our country. And we'd like to say first of all, 
welcome, and we hope you enjoyed your stay. Second 
of all, I think probably one of the most significant 
things we can think about when we think about Apollo 
is that it has opened for us -for us being the 
world -a challenge of the future. The door is 
now cracked, but the promise of the future lies 
in the young people, not just in America, but the 
young people all over the world learning to live 
and learning to work together. In order to remind 
all the people of the world in so many countries 
throughout the world that this is what we all are 
striving for in the future, Jack has picked up a 
vel_ significant rock, typical of what we have 
here in the valley of Taurus-Littrow. It's a 
rock composed of many fragments, of many s_zes, 



06 23 05 50 LMP-EVA 


CDR-EVA 


CC 
CDR-EVA 
CC 


CDR-EVA 


Tape 112A/21 


and many shapes, probably from all parts of the 
Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock 
of all fra -sizes and shapes, fragments of all 
sizes and shapes, and even colors that have grown 
together to become a cohesive rock, outlasting 
the nature of space, sort of living together in a 
very coherent, very peaceful manner. When we re


turn this rock or some of the others like it to 
Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock 
with so many of the countries throughout the world. 
We hope that this will be a symbol of what our 


feelings are, what the feelings of the Apollo Program 
are, and a symbol of mankind that we can live 


in peace and harmony in the future. 


Aportion ofa-ofarock willbesenttoa-a 
representative agency or museum in each of the 


countries represented by the young people in 
Houston today, and we hope that they will, that 


rock and the students themselves, will carry with 
them our good wishes, not only for the new year 


coming up but also for themselves, their countries, 
and all mankind in the future. Put that in the 
big bag, Geno. 

In the big bag. 


Roger -


We salute you, promise of the future. 


--Jack and Gene. We thank you for your 
sentiments and your interest. 


And now, let me bring this camera around. To com


memorate not just Apollo 17's visit to the Valley 
of Taurus-Littrow but as an everlasting commemoration 
of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the 
world, we'd tike to uncover a plaque that has been 
on the leg of our spacecraft that we have climbed 
down many times over the last 3 days. And I'll 
read what that plaque says to you. First of all, 
it has a picture of the world. Two pictures, one 


of the North America and one of South America. 
The other covers the other half of the world in


cluding Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, covers 



Tape 112A/22 


the North Pole and the South Pole. In between 
these two hemispheres, we have a pictorial view 
of the Moon, a pictorial view of where all the 
Apollo landings have been made so that when this 
plaque is seen again by others who come, they 
will know where it all started. The words are, 
"Here man completed his first exploration of the 
Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace 
in which we came be reflected in th_ lives of all 
mankind." It's signed, "E_ene A. _ernan, Ronald 
E. Evans_ Harrison H. Schmitt, and most prominently, 
Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States 
of America." This is our commemoration that will 
be here until someone like us, until some of you 
who are out there, who are the promise of the 
future, come back to read it again _nd to further 
the exploration and the meaning of Apollo. 
CC Roger, Gene. We in Houston copy that and echo 
your sentiments, and Dr. Fletcher is here beside 
me. He'd like to say a word to the two of you. 
MCC Gene and Jack, I've been in close touch with the 
White House, and the President has been following 
very closely your absolutely fascinating work up 
there. He'd like to wish you Godspeed as you 
return to Earth, and I'd like to personally second 
that. Congratulations. We'll see you in a few 
days. Over. 
CDR-EVA Thank you, Dr. Fletcher. We appreciate your comments, 
and we certainly appreciate -_hose of the 
President. And whether it be civilian or military, 
I think Jack and I would both like _o give our 
salute to America. 
06 23 10 00 LMP-EVA And, Dr. Fletcher, if I may, I'd like to remind 
everybody, I 'm sure, of something they' re aware, 
but this valley, this valley of history, has seen 
mankind complete its first evolutionary steps 
into the universe, leaving the planet Earth and 
going forward into the universe. I think no more 
significant contribution has Apollo made to his-
to_y. It's not often that you can foretell history, 
but I think we can in this case. And I 
think everybody ought to feel very proud of that 
fact. Thank you very much.

the gimbal, which is the center section there, the 
little square metal piece in the middle -tap 
sharply on the gimbal with the UHT, and then reverify 
the level on the LSG. We'll check response 
here in Mission Control after you've done that.

written up. So it's a 7-foot looking at the -all 
the switches to make sure you guys turned them the 
right way, I suppose. And then a 7-foot looking 
down-Sun, so that would be facing west, that side 
of it. 
LMP-EVA Okay. I got it. What else? 
06 23 18 08 CC Okay. Now, there's a problem with the central 
station -which they think the south end is buried 
more deeply in the dirt than they had intended. 
And the central station is at the present time 
getting very warm on the back side on the south 
side there, which is -they believe you probably 
buried in the ground when you were trying to tilt 
it to the proper alignment. They are requesting 
that, when you're at the ALSEP, you remove any 
soil buildup or debris with a convenient tool. 
They don't want you to touch it because it's 
fairly warm. But if you have a UHT or something 
to move it -Do you have a UHT with you or something 
with you that you can brush that soil aside 
with? 
LMP-EVA Yes, sir. 
CC Okay. You know the ... --
LMP-EVA It is piled up there. That's ... --
CC Yes. Okay. They'd like that brushed away. And 
you can give me a call --
LMP-EVA Fortunately, I brought my handy-dandy Rover 
sampler out. 


Tape 112A/28 
CC Okay. You can brush that aside, and give me a 
call when you think that's cleared up the way it 
ought to be. That's probably one of those things 
we didn't think about when we decided to tilt the 
central station. 
T_i°-EVA Well, you didn't -you couldn't anticipate the 
soil, Bob. It's very soft. 
06 23 19 30 CDR-EVA Bob, we are at VIP. 
CC Okay. And Ed Fendell is hard on my back to remind 
you that it's better to be too far away than too 
close. 
CDR-EVA All right. 
LMP-EVA I thought I was, but I think I may move just a 
little bit. There's a little rise kere I can give 
you. I think I'll give it to you. 
CC Okay. 
I2{P-EVA By the way, Bob, the soil gets more cohesive with 
depth. I hadn't really noticed that before. 
CC Okay. We copy that. What do you nctice? 
LMP-EVA It's -it's quite a bit more cohesive at -about 
the -feels about the same down to _ centimeters 
out here, and then the cohesiveness goes up, so 
it's difficult to scrape with the Rcver sampler. 
CC Copy that, Jack. 
CDR-EVA Well_ I think you can see almost everything 
from here. 
CC Okay, Geno. And, Jack, let me know when you get 
done scraping that soil away. 
LMP-EVA I will. 
LMP-EYA And now comes the hardest alignment of them all, 
but I'll get it. 


Tape 112A/29 
LMP-EVA Somewhere about there. See if I can't tweak it 
up for you. Bob, the east-west level bubble is 
not quite level. The north-south is. Do you 
want me to tweak that up? 
CC Yes, you might tweak 
good signal, but go 
little bit.

Tape 112A/30 
CDR-EVA You can look at your vantage point, and if you 
don't like it, let me know. 
CC Okay. I'll call Captain Video. 
LMP-EVA Bob? 
CC Go. 
LMP-EVA How close can soil be to this back plate of 
the ALSEP? 
CC Stand by. I'll check. 
06 23 23 56 LMP-EVA It's about 30 centimeters away, most of the 
places now. 
CC Okay. That sounds good. We'd like you to return 
to the surface gravimeter, Jack. What you did had 
some effect, but not -not a lasting effect. And 
we'd like you to rap even more sharply, more 
strongly on the gimbal another three times. And 
we're again watching it, and we'll let you know 
what to do. And -I might tell you that this has 
all been done recently this afternoon up at 
Bendix on the qual unit, and it survived it and 
so we aren't in any real danger apparently of 
destroying it. 
L_-EVA Okay. Three times, huh? 
CC Roger. Or up to three times. 
LMP-EVA Bob, don't let me forget to bring a dustbrush 
back when I come .... --
CC Okay. I'll mark that down and remind you. And, 
Jack, you'll be glad to know that the temperature 
of the back plate there has already dropped 
20 degrees -20 degrees. 
LMP-EVA Oh, beautiful. 
06 23 25 58 CDR-EVA Bob, I don't think that bubble is working. 


Tape 112A/31 
CC Oh. 
CDR-EVA How's your signal now? 
CC Stand by. I'll check. But why don't you go to 
the -to the surface gravimeter? 
LMP-EVA Bob, how's your TV lens? I don't have a lens 
brush. It looks good from here. I don't want to 
use this unless you think so. 
CC Stand by. 
LMP-EVA Knock three times. (Singing) 
CC Roger. Get out of the way please, Jack, and we'2! 
take a look against some bright soil. 
CDR-EVA What? 
LMP-EVA No, that's me he's talking to. 
CC Okay. It looks pretty good, Geno. Go ahead. 
CDR-EVA I ... with the lens brush. 
CC Yes, go ahead. It looks pretty good to us. 
CDR-EVA Okay. 
LMP-EVA Okay, Bob. Here come the raps. Knock three 
times. Okay. 
CC Okay, Jack. That's really fighting it pretty 
hard. We'd like you to put the UHT in the socket, 
and rock it very firmly. Don't pick it up, but 
rock it very firmly from side to side in all four 
directions -Move the UHT about 6 inches in each 
direction while you're doing it. 
06 23 27 39 LMP-EVA Okay. 
LMP-EVA Okay, I rocked it. It's swinging. 
CC Okay. Is it reading? 


Tape 112A/32 
LMP-EVA And the level bubble is -better. 
CC Okay. We understand it's in good configuration 
again as far as alignment and leveling is concerned, 
Jack. Let's go on and take some more 
ALSEP photos, and let them think about it for 
a minute. 
LMP-EVA Okay. What do you want? 
CC Okay. Next, what we want is some heat flow -
Okay. We just got late word. They'd like to do 
it one more time, and then call it _uits. 
LMP-EVA The rocking bit, huh? 
CC Roger. The walk -rocking bit one more time. 
CDR-EVA Bob, I may have moved the high gain. Do you see 
any change in signal? 
CC Stand by. 
CDR-EVA If you're happy, I won't touch it. 
LMP-EVA Okay, Bob. It's rocked. The shadow ... -the 
shade is aligned to the Sun now, antiit's level. 
06 23 29 49 CC Okay. We copy that, and let's go get some ALSEP 
photos, Jack. I think you got some heat flow 
photos the other night, besides the two pans. 
If you did, we may -these may be redundant. 
They're -they want the cross-Sun _ld down-Sun 
of the east hole and cross-Sun and down-Sun of 
the west hole. And I'm not sure but what you 
got those earlier. You said you got some extra 
heat flow, but tell me if you did. They're both -
all four of these are 7-foot --
LMP-EVA I -
CC Go ahead. 
LMP-EVA I'll get the heat flow pictures. They -One was 
ll-foot, I think. And then the steropair. 


Tape 112A/33 
CC Yes. I think all they're asking for is the two 
7-foot stereopairs. 
06 23 30 51 LMP-EVA Okay. That's one of them. 
CC Okay. What they're asking for, Jack, is a 7-foot 
down-Sun and a 7-foot cross-Sun, which isn't quite 
what we've been taking in the past. 
LMP-EVA I'm getting the standard ones, Bob. 
CC Copy that. 
LMP-EVA Okay. You got the standard documentation. 
CC Okay --
LMP-EVA il-footers and 7-foot stereos. 
CC Okay. Go ahead. They can't complain about 
that, certainly. 
I_{P-EVA Okay. Now what? 
CC Okay. We'd like a 3-foot shot of the lunar mass 
spectrometer, including the orifice where the 
breccia was. And, Geno, we are observing some 
degradation and would like to have the high gain --
LMP-EVA Cross-Sun? 
CC Yes, yes, Jack; 3-foot cross-Sun. And, Gene; this 
is Houston. We'd like to get the high gain reoriented 
a little bit. We're observing some degradation 
in the picture. 
CDR-EVA I'll tweak it. 
06 23 32 15 LMP-EVA Okay. Got it. Now what? LMS is complete. 
CC Okay. Copy that. Now we want to go over the 
neutron flux, Jack.

Yes, I got a cameras over there. I'm going to 
look under the seats one more time. Nothing but 
a 500 -Okay. Used tape. 


Okay. Jack, we're ready to leave the ALSEP. 


Well, I hate to do that, Bob. I'm sorry about 


this gravimeter, though. 


Well, you're not the only one. The word is down 
here there's a whole room full of people who are 
sorry. 

Okay. I got the LMP's camera. Nothing in here 
but couple of old bags. We used about all the 
bags we had, Jack. Not many here. Bob, I have

about whether you've opened the battery

CDR-EVA 
Oh, what a nice little machine. Parked on a little 
downslope, but at the heading you want, and I guess 
Ed's satisfied with the TV response, huh? 


CC 
Roger. We're satisfied with the TV, Gene. We're 
ready for you to take the EP number 3. 


CDR-EVA 
Good old Mother Earth is right smack in the center. 


CDR-EVA 
Bob, while we've got a quite moment here, as I go 
to de -deploy that EP charge, I'd Just like to 
say that any part of Apollo 17, or any part of 
Apollo, that has been a success thus far is probably, 
for the most part, due to the thousands of 
people in the aerospace industry who have given a 
great deal, besides dedication and besides effort 
and besides professionalism, to make it all a 
reality. And I would just like to thank them, 


because what we've done here and what has been 


done in the past -As a matter of fact, what has 


been done for 200 years, you've got to contribute 
to the spirit of a group of people who form the 
aerospace industry. And I God bless you and 


thank you. 


CC 
Roger, Gene. And we thank you guys. 


CDR-EVA 
Well, we're just two little -two little sets of 
twinkletoes here. There's a lot that goes to 
getting this Rover running out here that we don't 
have much to do with. And I guess there might be 


someone else that has something to do with it too, 
and I've been reading his signs, maybe not from 
Him directly, but His in spirit, as we run up and 
down that ladder. And that's Godspeed, the crew 
of Apollo 17. And if He's listening, I'd like to 
thank Him, too. Pin i is pulled.

No, sir. Thank you. Okay. Bob, -Then 
we're ready for you guys to get back to the

adjacent to the ring on the west etd, and I'm

fact, we have three records here to read out to 
you guys. On Apollo 17, two of them; one, the 
longest single EVA, 7 hours 37 minutes and 
22 seconds. The longest total lunar surface EVA 


time 22 hours 5 minutes and 6 seconds. And the 
summary, the total lunar surface EVA time for 
the Apollo Program, 80 hours 44 minutes and 


8 seconds. 


That's quite a tribute to the people who made 
it possible. Thank you, Bob. 


Roger, Geno. And I can't speak as authoritatively 
as some people have tonight, but for all of us 
around me, I'll say thank you, also. 


Your words are well taken. You know how I feel. 


Hey, Gene and Ron, this is the CSM CAPCOM. 
Thought you might be interested. Your buddie up

ready to bed down himself, right now. And he 


did take a good look at the landing site through 
binoculars tonight and took a good look at Shorty 
crater there, and noticed quite a lot of variations 
in color. That may be the same color 
changes you saw in that orange soil and that, but 
we're trying to match it all up. And Farouk and 
Ron are working it out. We're trying to match 
it all up and see if we can get a comparison 


there. 


Excellent. Tell him we'll see him tomorrow. 


Yes, he's counting on it. 


How's America looking to you, Bob? 


Well, I'll give an update. It -it's working 
p_rfect. No problems at all and we got good 
SIM bay data on everything. The b_, vhe IR, the

Gene, about this total limit of any problem 
there is, and it's not a problem, is we're just 


having to stir those H2 tanks manually because 
of that limiting cycle on the pressure switch 
there. We could go back to auto but it's easier 
to go manual. 


I'll be back up there tomorrow and I'll stir them 


for you. 


Roger. And Jack and Gene, let me make a node 
here for you guys. There will be a series of 
references to this throughout the checklist but 
there's a general thing and you might even put 
a piece of tape across it if you want to or something 
-rather than go through and call out all 


the locations. We'll leave PRESS REG A closed for 


the rest of the time. Might just keep that in 


mind. 


Okay, Bob, we'll -I think we'll handle that one 


okay.

as -as the Commander. We're going to have to do 


two burns tomorrow on America. The -the orbit 


the mascons didn't deteriorate the orbit as much 


as everybody thought it was so there's going to 
be an RCS burn about an hour prior to the -to 


the LOPC burn. 


That's interesting, Bob. Are you going to do a

Well, yes, I guess that's what it'llbe -it's 


going to be an RCS burn at about L1 foot per 


second. It'll drop the -it'll clrculize the 


orbit and then we'll do the plane change burn. 


Okay, and 17, we'd like you to press on reasonably

No fair, Jack, you can't go collecting samples 
after the EVA's over. 


Say -say Bob, right now I can't f_nd the

collection bag will be in bag 3. 


Okay, we note that. Thank you. Very good.

we'll just drop it right there. We're about an

Ntmlber 1. 
at station 
Wanted to know if zhe 
6 are similar to those 
LMP-LM Ken, I think they are. But I think you'll find 
that the ones in station 6 are much more metamorphic 
rock, or recrystallized rock, than the ones we 
had at station 2. I had the impression that the 
ones we were sampling at station 6 were -were 
really inclusions in the -anorthositic gabbro -
and had -had been probably considerably metamorphosed 
by it being included in it; whereas, 
the ones we had at station 2 were a separate 
rock type apparently, as I recall it, anyway. 
MCC Okay; that's good. 
LMLP-LM Ken, let me just say that i -My impression is 
that there was a lot more action in the rocks az 
station 6 than 2. i saw a lot more; a ioz more 
was evident, the inclusions and, some of %he 
patterns, some of the other things we saw.

LMP-LM 


CDR-LM 


Ail right, sir. Let's go on to the second one, 


and it said: Do we understand that there were 
no breccias at station 8? 


In the one -that parent orthopyroxene piagiociase 
rock -was a breccia in the sense it was frac


tured and was injected by dark _!ass. But it 
would be what we would call a mosaic breccia, in 
that respect, I think, and not the -Didn't see 

any station 6-or station 2-type breccias there 


at all. Other than the subfloo:c gabbro, that 


orthopyroxene plagioclase rock was the only 
major rock type I think we saw, unless we picked 


up some in the rake sample. 


Okay. Okay; the third one says: What are your 


impressions of the distribution of the -the 


familiar subfloor gabbros throughout the EVA-3 


traverse? 


Well, I don't -I don't -I think we discussed 


that a little bit on the traverse -quite a bit, 
as a matter of fact. The impression I had was 


that most of the traverse on the plains, with 
the one exception of -of Van Serg Crater, were 


-We were in box fields or frag_ent fields that 
were almost -well, were dominately subf!oor. 
And visually from the Rover, I had no impression 
of any other significant rock t_?e, with the 
exception of occasional blocks of the gray variety 
of the subfloor gabbro. And I don't know -Gene 
-Z don't know what Gene's impression was. He was 
driving a lot, but -pass it on. 


I think -we actually even commented wiien we hi_, 
the breaking slope coming back ou_ of staaion 6 
and 7, and then back off as -coming back do_ at 


8 -how the terrain features ch_mged, i shink 


that was due principally to the -to the -what 
we've been calling the subfioor material evident. 
And there again, it was, what I would say_ par_
icularly mantled, filleted, _dch like we nave 
here where the LM is, with the excepsion of V_ 


Serg, where we actually saw fragmental bo_iders 


for the most part, a lot less b_ied sit_ing on 


the surface. 



Tape 114A/7 
MCC Ail right, sir. At Van Serg, some rocks were 
described as gray breccias, and some contained 
white fragments. Was there a variety of breccias 
present? 
LMP-LM I think -I think not, Ken. My impression was 
that there was a variety only in their -in the 
degree to which they were fractured. We found 
and sampled, I think, the two major -one extreme 
-extremely fractured rock that I said was -
was friable. Anyway, it broke into small pieces 
very easily with a hammer or in your hand, if you 
worked at it. And the other was a breccia that 
was not -was much more cohesive than that. It 
was not fractured or friable at all, but they 
both were on the rim, and I think they were Just 
varieties of -probably of shock fracturing. 
MCC Okay. Could the Van Serg breccias correlate with 
the blue-gray material at Cochise? 
07 02 56 40 I}{P-LM That's possible, I guess. But my first guess 
would be that the blue-gray at Cochise was blue-
gray subfloor. And, well, I don't know. That's 
a good question. That's a good question. We -
Maybe with the pictures we have, we can work out 
the -an attitude -approximate attitude on that 
contact that I talked about in Cochise, and see 
if it would project over reasonably to Van Serg. 
I wouldn't be surprised if it would. That's a 
good -that's a good point. To me they looked 
very similar. 
MCC Okay. And you guys sure you're eating? 
LMP-LM But -but -Ken, Ken, Ken --
MCC Go ahead. 
CDR-LM Yes, we're eating. We're fixing and eating at 
the same time. 
CC You're mighty efficient. Go ahead. You were 
starting to say something. 
LMP-LM You just -yes, Ken. i think from a diszance 
we saw the blue-gray in Cochise, you coui_'v

make a definite correlation. But it's a good 


idea and ought to be considered as one of the 


possibilities. The other is that we juss had a 


window in the subfloor that coincidentally -I 


mean one underneath the subfloor might be that 


breccia. Oh, incidentally -the Van Serg impact 


hit that window. 


Okay. Can you tell us anything about the cowpie 


at Van Serg. Was that a clast in the breccia? 


Negative. It was a -excuse me_ I have my mouth 


full. 


It's about time. 


It was an ag -it was an aggregate of irregular 


looked like agglutinated glass in fragments Just 


sitting on the rim of Van Serg. And the reason 


I said I thought it was in place or had -had 


fallen there and crystallized there, is that 


there were four or five similar fragments arrs_nged 


in a small coherent area. Not making that very 


clear I don't think, but it looks as if it hit 


and broke apart upon hitting a little bit but 


didn't -didn't really splatter or -or brer_k 


apart in any significant manner. 


Ail right. 


There are similar things -I tell you what it looks 
like. If anybody'd walked up the rim of Kilauea 
Iki in the ash out there, and on top of the ash, 
there are bombs that were fairly clearly molten 


when they hit, and they had Just -Just enough 
spring to break when they hit. But they -the 
individual pieces didn't move very far as ail. 


And you can see that pattern on Kiiauea iki. 
And it was the same kind of thing, except that 
there was no directional aspect of it here. 


Okay. 


And that's no_ to say it's volcs_ic glass. Thas_s 
just the kind of pattern i_ was. 



Tape 114A/9 
MCC Okay. Can you tell us if the darker material 
in the bottom of Van Serg was similar to the 
collected rim material? 
07 03 00 52 LMP-LM I think so, except as Gene pointed out, the 
clasts were coarser. They were coarser in the 
bottom than about anything we saw in the rim. 
MCC Okay. Are there any distinctive features, other 
than color, to separate tan from blue-gray 
breecias, such as Joining, or massive nature, 
continuity, anything of that nature? 
LMP-_4 Yes, we're --
CDR-LM Where did we find those tan breccias? 
CC Challenger, this is Bob. I think we were talking 
about some of them, I think, at station 1 the 
first night. We had both natures. In fact, I 
think we had -Didn't we have two of those in 
the same rock together? 
I2ZP-LM They were both gabbros. 
CC Yes, excuse me --
07 03 01 57 LMP-LM Bob, they were tan gabbros and blue-gray gabbros.

07 03 02 52 CC Roger. Okay, yesterday, excuse me, I wasn't 
reading the question. Okay, the breecias -they 
were tan and blue-gray breccias yesterday at station 
2, were not -were there not? You have the 
two type -types of breccias at station 2. 
LMP-LM Oh well, yes, yes, that's right. And now as I 
think back I guess that's the main difference 
between the tan rocks at station 2 and station 6, 
but the ones at 6 appear to be -have an igneous 
texture or at least a very crystalline texture 
and inclusion-like masses of other rocks. Whereas, 
the ones at station 2 they -they seem to be 
fragment breccias, as I recall. That's right, 
although they may have been recrystallized or 
metamorphosed, they were clearly breceias at 
station 2. I just forgot about that. 
07 03 03 00 CC Okay, copy that. Okay, and can you amplify your 
description going out to station 6. In particular 
were there blue-gray and tan-gray bands on the 
North Massif? 
LMP-LM Rather than bands, there were lines that appeared 
to be the upper terminus of the -of the source 
of the boulders that were strewn below that line. 
And those lines tended to be either -show a blue-
gray source or a tan-gray source, if you will. 
LMP-LM Oh, those ... 
CC Challenger, if you -if you think 
to us, you're breaking up badly.

Can I -one little shot, it was actually just 


particles. Something we threw o_t must have 


popped. 


Okay, do you have any preliminary stratigraphic 


sequence for the plains? 


For the plains, huh? Well, my g_ess would be that 
the Van Serg breccias were the oldest rocks. The 
gabbro -subfloor gabbro's the next oldest, and 
the mantling material's the youngest. But that's the 
only good clear relationship was mantle on 
top of the subfloor gabbros. I -we really don't 
have a good relationship of the breccias and 7 
just -I guess I lean towards thinking that that 
Van Serg was a window in the subfloor rather than 
being a bed of some kind, on top of the subfloor. 


Okay, and do you have an opinion on what underlies 
the Sculptured Hills? 


Well, I think, we said -the rake sample is probably 
going to tell the tale there. My _ess is 


from the boulder -boulders and subfloor around 


up there that -are of gabbro and maybe the Sculptured 
Hills are a version of the subfloor rock. 


I don't think that the orthopyroxene anorthosite 
rock was necessarily indigenous _o the Sculptured 
Hills. It was glass-coated and permeated by glass 
so I suspect it may have been thrown there by an 
impact somewhere else. 


All right sir, we've got one las5 thing for you to 
clean up. Back on page 7-6 of your checklist, it

CDR-LM And I guess if -if you could go in -_ feeling 
is if you go to the bottom of every one of those 
large craters like Camelot, you could examine 
some of these fragments on the walls and down into 
the bottom, I Just get a feeling you'd find this -
this blue-gray breccia down there. 
CC Ail right, sir. 
CDR-LM I mean in all the big craters like Camelot. 
LMP-LM Well we -I think maybe that's true, however, we 
did not see isolated fragments of it very often, 
if at all, out here on the, the plains themselves, 
away from the craters. So if the blue-gray breccia 
does -the Van Serg breccia does underlie the sub-
floor_ the craters are not -it's far enough that 
the craters we have apparently have not penetrated 
and brought up much of that kind of material. 
Well that's it.

RCS on the trim maneuver, in order to avoid 
impinging on the SIM bay. That burn will be 
about 30 seconds worth. And that's going to give 
you about 9 foot per second DELTA-V. The maneuvers 
have all been checked out, and it's a reasonable 
time line. And so, I have both the plarle change 
and the trim pads for you. Anm that may cut into 
your eat period Just a little bit. Sos you mighv 
keep that in mind, that when you get a chance to 
nibble; that's probably a good -good thing to be 
doing. And then once we finish the pla_e change, 
we -we're going to be back on the nominal Flight 
Plan, and pressing on in a -just like we have 
been. We'll be leaving vhe mapping caz_ara in and

attempt to avoid increasing the n_ber of cycles 


on the camera. And we'll be running the SPS PU 


valve in the decreased position, in order ko 


optimize our propellant loadings. 


Ah ha! Okay. That sounds like it's good. 


So, when you're ready to copy some of those things, 


that's -Might be a good thing to get started on. 


Go ahead and finish squaring away your cockpit. 


And, while they're putting together an official 


summary, I can tell you my unofficial summary of 


EVA-3 is that that sure is super. You've got to 


wavch those tapes when you get do_n. That's 


really a -that's really a spectacular place, as 


you can probably see. And they found a lot of 


mighty interesting rocks there. Jack, being a 


true geologist, is making up new geological terms 


as he goes along. 


(Laughter) I can -yes, I bet. 


Wh_ you ought to do is, when he gets aboard, you 
ought to tell him that you saw a bunch of vertical 
dikelets over on the north side of the massif. 


Tell him they were very dark, very small. 


Vertical dikelets? 


Yes, I think that's the word he coined on the way 
dov_ there. 


Dikelets? Oh, okay (laughter). 


Hey, I got a Update Book here. I guess it'll be 
good for a _rim burn -trim ... 


Okay. In general, let me tell you also that your 
RCS is 4.7 above the Flight Plan. And, just as a 
summary, unless you want to plo_ _hem, i'ii just 
tell you that the oxygen and the hMdrogen are 
doing good things. And you've gov plenty of iv.

Rigel, 118, 159, 349. This will be four jets, 
minus-X on the RCS. And, I'd like to just add a 
comment here about the attitude. This attitude 
is one that's computed after you've gone to the 
plane-change REFSMMAT. And when you call P41, 
you'll be getting a different set of attitudes 
computed out of it because of the P41 computing 
a plus-X burn. But, when you're in attitude and 
P41's called, and you get to the DELTA-V register, 
you should be able to put all of the DELTA-V in 
one axis.

with the VERB 49 there. The next one is at 
181:35, which is on the next page, and it's going 
to be at VERB 49, maneuver to LOPC. What we're 
going to do here is two separate maneuvers. We're 
going to do a maneuver which is a roll, so that 
when you do the next one, you'll avoid the gimbal 
lock because of the direction that the CMC would 
normally maneuver you. So, this maneuver is going 
to be in two parts. The first one we're calling 
a VERB 49 maneuver vo the gimbal lock avoidance 
attitude at 181:35. That attitude 081, 181, and 
317. The HIGH GAIN: PITCH, minus 19; YAW, 227, 
and AUTO and NARROW for AOS. 
07 09 28 50 CMP Okay, at 181:35, we'll have a VERB 49 to gimbal 
lock avoidance; roll 081, 181, and 317. HIGH

AUTO and NARROW for AOS.

Okay. 


This is put together by a -a Mr. Jim Kokowsky [?] 
and it looks like he's done a pretty nice job of 
summarizing the news, so I'm going to read iu 
cold. And he's given us a summary of the late 
news. And the weather couldn't be worse in 
Houston. It had to be better on the Moon or in 
orbit around it. This morning more cold and 


drizzle blanketed the Houston metropolitan area. 
Yesterday morning it was 32 degrees. This morning 
a little warmer but a lot wetter, and it's getting 
colder on Friday. On the national-_nternatienal 
scene: Peace talks in Paris between Dr. Henry 
Kissinger and Le Duc Tho have ended -at ]east 
for the time being. Dr. Kissinger is in Washzington 


today to brief President Nixon on the aa!ks. The 
past 3-1/2 weeks, the pair of negotiators havu 
held 58 hours of talks. Neither side is giving out 



Tape 119B/5 


any hints. When asked about the cease-fire by 
Christmas, Dr. Kissinger told reporters at Andrews, 
"I don't want to make any predictions." The U.S. 
by sizeable vote has had its assessment to the 
fund of the United Nations reduced by a vote of 
81 to 27. The U.S. will now pay only 25 percent 
of the cost rather than the present 31 percent. 
Transatlantic fares may drop beginning in February. 
The International Air Transport Association 
says all carriers will set their own prices. It 
appears that air travelers to Europe next year maj 
get some real bargains. In the hotly contested 
and federally supervised United Mine Workers cie 
tion, the insurgent candidate, Arnold Miller, has 
gone into a lead over incumbent President Tony 
Boyle. Miller has ].ed a grass roots movement to 
oust Boyle who took over the union control from 
the late John L. Lewis. We mentioned the rather 
dismal weather in the Houston area this morning, 


but the midwest and northeast are really gettlr


some bad weather. Ice storms seriously hampered 
the northern part of the nation, from Idaho to 
the eastern seaboard. After almost a year, troops 


involved in the India-Pakistani War are beginning 
to go back to their homelands. Truce-line mans 
have been exchanged and approved by both governments. 
Civil servants of the European Common 
Market, they're called Eurocrats, are on strike. 
The 8000 employees walked off the job due to a 
salary dispute. 


CC 
On the regional and local scene: the Houston 
City council has vetoed a plan to build a new 
commuter airstrip in southwest Houston for the STOL 
aircraft. Residents of the area have been protesting. 
The community of Tomball, north of Houston, 
is looking for a new police force. The police 
chief and seven officers walked off the Job Tuesday, 
after the City Council refused the officers a pay 
raise. In Harris County, the State Highway Patrol 
snd reserve police have been called in to maintain 
police protection. That's maintain protection in 


Tomball. The project to expend the -expand the 
Armand Bayou as a park and wildlife refuge has 
been given a boost with a $100,000 pledge. So 
far $350,000 has been pledged and $750,000 is

The bonds, if okayed, will be used to air-condition 
all schools not so equipped and to _mprove lighting 
in two schools. It's a light day ir sports; the 
head coaching job for SMU is open, being considered 
are North Carolina coach Bill Dooiey, and 
Washington coach Jim Owens. George Blanda, a 
living testimony for the over-hO set will become 
the oldest man ever to play football this Sunday. 
Prior to Blanda, I guess, we've had some other 
folks, but this ought to be a new record. In 
pro basketball, Houston didn't play last night. 
Currently, Baltimore, Boston, Milwaukee, and Los 
Angeles lead the divisions. In pro hockey, 


Alberta beat the Houston Aeros, 3 tc 2. The big 
news in Houston sports is a City Council approval 
of the Greenway Plaza as a site for the 
10-1/2-million-dollar sports arena. And finally 
in -Christmas shopping is in full swing. Christmas 
trees are in tents, on street corners, and 
supeI_arket sites all over the area. Private 
homes throughout the whole area are lighting up 
with decorations ranging from happy Santa Clauses 
in sleighs to nativity scenes. It will be a 
Christmas world waiting for you when you come home. 
And that ends our summary for this morning. 


That's a good su_ary_ appreciate it. Little bit 


of everything in there. 


Yes, it looks like Mr. Kokowsky [?] reads a lot 


of newspapers there.

if it looks agreeable to you, just go ahead and 
we'll use that as the burn attitude. You'll have 
to get a new P40 trim to take care of the gimbal

07 12 53 14 CC Good morning, Challenger and thank you for the 
vocal rendition from -from the Moon, there. 
CDR-LM Well, we thank you for your kind music. We 
wanted to let you know we were thinking about 
you this morning, Gordie. 
CC You Just beat us to it, but --
CDR-LM That was a great song. 
CC Decided to play it anyway, because it's such a 
-such a pretty selection. 
CDR-LM I think it's very apropo at the moment. I guess 
I can just wait for "Hail Purdue," huh? 
CC Yes, just stand by, you'll probably hear it 
before you get back. 
CDR-LM Hey, we've been stirring for about 15 or 
20 minutes. We're in the midst of a nice hamburger 
omelet (laughter) and assorted accessories. 
As a matter of fact, it's all over us. And if 
you'll give me 5 minutes, I'll be ready to go 
on the PGNS, unless you want to start it sooner. 
07 12 54 37 CC Okay, we'll -No hurry, finish up and get cleaned 
up there. And the only change, we have some change 
in the timing as far as the checklist so we can 
gain back the time we're behind now, which is 
actually less than an hour. And the only hardware 
change other than deletions is to -that 
we'd like you to leave Demand REG A, CLOSED, at 
all times. So whenever you come across a place 
that says OPEN at CABIN or EGRESS, we'd like you 
to leave it CLOSED.

Ckay, Gordie. We've got you on that. 


And, Gordie, could I have a quick status report 


on -on America and Challenger? 


You bet. America is just as good as gold, Just 


like always. Ron got off the trim burn on the 


back side followed by a good pt_le change on 


the front side. In fact he -G_ cut-off was a 


tenth and -or less in all axes. Didn't even 


need to trim it. So, he's in about a 62-1/2 


circular, I believe, and waiting for you to come 


up and join him. 


Okay, how's his consumables? 


Stand by. 


Okay, America's consumables are great and so 
are yours. There is a possibility we may have to 


switch to ASCENT WATER, Just prior to lift-off. 
Everything really is in good shape. 


Those are good words, Gordie. _lank you. 


Hey, Gordie. In honor of one of your comm 
handovers last night, and in the tradition of 
Apollo 8, I've got paraphrase of a familiar 


poem for you. 


Okay; go ahead. 


Well, it's "The week before Christmas and all 


through the I_M,not a commander _as stirring, not 


even Cernan. The samples were stowed in their 
places with care, in hopes that with you, they 
soon will be there. And Cernan --Gene in his 


hammock and I in my cap, had just settled our 
brains for a long -short lunar nap. But out 
on the -up on comm loop there rose such a 
scatter, I sprang from my hammock, to see what 


was the matter. The Sun on the breast of the 


s_mrface below gave the luster of objects, as if in 
snow. And what to my wandering eyes shoui_ 
appear, but a miniature Rover aJ_deight tiny 


reindeer. And a little old driver so lively and

quick, I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick. 
I heard him exclaim as he -over the hills he did 
speed. Merry Christmas to all and to all -to you 
all Godspeed. 
CC Very good. 
CDR-LM Gordo, that was the first time I heard that and 
I got to say -I got to say that is beautiful. 
CC I agree. Did the _4P get any sleep or did he 
spend all night composing that? 
L_P-LM People always said we ought to have a poet in 
space. 
CDR-LM I don't think we've made it yet. 
LMP-_4 No, for some reason I really woke up with one of 
your handovers last night, and that vas how I went 
back to sleep. 
_4P-LM Gordy, that's for the kids .... 
07 12 59 24 CC Roger, Jack. 
07 13 00 20 CC Challenger, Houston. One update for the postsleep 
procedure. I understand you brought in the LMP's 
camera, and we want to be sure you get that into 
the jett bag before the final jettison here, and 
by the way, you're STAY for the final Jettison. 
CDR-LM Okay, Gordy. It's already in the jett bag, thank 
you. 
LMP-_M And, Gordy, you might make some notes tha_ before 
I put it in there, I took another black-and-white 
or black-and-white window pan with mag Nancy. 
CC Okay, Jack. Roger. 
CDR-LM Gordo, on REQ A, that is -you interpret vhat is 
just a small leak by the reg? _nat it would be 
usable, if you had to.

That's affirmative, Geno. It's a small slow leak

Okay, thank you. It's coming up so far, i vhir2_ 


that's all -all the system anomalies we've got, 


isn't it? 


That's all I can think of at the moment. I do have 
revised times for the rest of the Lunar Surface 


Checklist which, at a convenient time, I can give 


to you -so that you'll have a h_w-goes-it as you 


go on down the line here. 


Why don't you give them to us no_, Gordy? 


Ckay, turn to page 7-9. 


Go ahead. 


Okay, 7-9 LGC/IMU POWER UP, chan_e that time 


from 183:04 to 184:10. The eat seriod time is 


now 184:20. Turn the page, and the 183:59 above 


"Park RENDEZVOUS RADAR" is now 135:05. Next 


page, don suits at 185:15. Go to the next page. 


Prep for equipment jettison is 1,35:50, and the 


same page -helmet/glove donning is 185:58. Next 


page, pressure integrity check, [[86:04. Cabin 


depress is 186:08, and hatch opening is 186:12. 


Next page, 14, cabin repress is [[86:15. Cabin 


cleanup for launch is 186:20. _ld on the follow


ing page, we're going to delete -;he P22 but we'd 


like you to go all the procedures except those 


from "VERB 95 ENTER," through "P00 ENTER," 


inclusive -the center section of procedures. £;o 


you'll still be closing the rendezvous radar 


breakers, going to IX)C, and park:lng the _ltenna 


and copying pad. Over. 


Okay, we're going to delete eve_rthing from VERB 95 
through P00 on P22. That's the center of the page. 


That's affirmative and then the next page, cabin 


prep for ascent is 186:45_ and instead of 39 min


utes we're going to have you do that in 3 minutes. 
And you'll actually -you should have a iiztle 
more time than that, since you goz up early. That 
pats you righz back with rime line, az lift-off 


minus 1 hour 15, at 186:48. Over. 



Tape 121A/5 
CDR-LM Okay, top at 7-15 where we pick up -what was 
going to be the beginning of the P227 Have you 
got a time up there? 
CC I guess we'll just have to work that in with cabin 
cleanup time. We had deleted that whole time block 
but you do have to catch those procedures. 
CDR-LM Okay, and then the times on the top of 7-10, 
P22, are not applicable, and I guess you can 
us an update for our P57 lift-off time. 
for 
give 
07 13 05 55 CC That's affirmative. We might -that might be -
there's a couple more changes coming at me here 
but let me make sure I got them straight and I'll 
call you later. Go ahead'with whatever you were 
doing. 
CDR-LM Okay. 
CDR-LM (Cough) Gordy, if I -if I get ready for the 
LGC/IMU power up, I'll give you a call even though 
it comes earlier but I'd like to get that started, 
as soon as we're ready to start it. 
CC Okay. We concur with that. 
LMP-LM Hey, Gordy, as far as the food, medication, and 
sleep goes -no medication. Gene had 5 hours of 
good sleep, I had probably around my usual 6, in 
spite of my poetic inclinations. And the food -
we continued to do well, I believe. We've eaten 
a wet pack apiece last night. We got one this 
morning. We've eaten our scrambled eggs and 
sausage yesterday, and as we've run out of juices 
and tea. And which is somewhat of an inconvenience 
I might say. And if you've got any specific questions, 
I can fill you in on it but, I think, food-
wise we've done pretty well. 
CC Can you give us a feel on the fluid intake? 
LMP-LM Well, that's what I was trying to do when 
we'd drunk all the juices and tea. Plus, 
in particular, takes water from the hose. 
I said

I'll let Jack give you a call. I'm going to start

Gordy, you ready for a PGN? 


That's affirmative, finally got you a GO to start

Tape 121A/7

VERB 32 after the last -after for the remaining 
data stars and after last star. In other words, 
just delete all between the box and up to circuit 
breaker A0T LAMP, OPEN. And, of course, they'll 
be no P22 time, over. 
CDR-IA_ Okay. Delete all the data star information between 
the start of that box and after last star 
VERB 34 ENTER, 00 ENTER. 
CC That's correct and then turn to page 7-15. We're 
changing -we -looking here a little closer we 
find that radars are already in good position, so 
you can delete all procedures on page 7-15, except 
"Copy Ascent pads, CSI pad, and LM DAP weight." 
CDR-LM Okay. We deleted everything but the last three 
lines on that page. 
CC Okay. On page 7-12, back up a couple pages. In 
the lower right corner there, in the blank space, 
you might jot down 185:58, VHF check with command 
module. And that'll be according to the procedures 
on 7-15 in the box. You might Just parenthesis 
7-15 to remind you where the procedure 
is. But the comm check will come during that time 
when you're preping for equipment jettison, or right 
around there. 
CDR-LM Okay. We got that. 
CC Okay. That's all we got for you, and we have the 
E-MOD dump okay. 
CDR-LM Okay.

enough.

spot. 


Okay. You're clear to torque those. 


Say, Gordy, are we clear to jettison the buddy SLSS 
bag, now? 


That's affirmative, Jack. We've determined you 
won't need it for rock stowage. And along the 
same line, John Young suggested that you might 


check your checklist pockets on your suits, when 
you get to that point. His were full of dirt. 
You might want to take those off and discard them 
if that's the case, so that it won't fly up and get 
you at insertion.

Thank you, Gordo. 


Amd, Challenger, it's your computer now. 


Thank you. 


Gordo, did you ever get any word on the Rover 
batteries? 


No. I sure haven't. I haven't heard on that one. 


It's not important. I just wondered whether _hose 
things were going to be working back there. 


Okay. We'¥e got no reason to believe they won't. 
_qaen you get down to parking the rendezvous radar 


antenna after this P57, give me a call. We're 
going to change the parking position. 


Okay.

Okay. Do a-as -as vhe checklist shows, excecv 


do a VERB 41 NOUN 72 to 0 and 30 degrees. 00 
to SLEW, and then delete the "manual slew for

Okay, Gordo. 
Got my suit on. 


Okay, Ron. We gave you the wrong skinny on the

in a full MSFN relay mode. We'd like you to stay 


off of VOX. 
Over. 


Can do. I'm off VOX. 


Challenger, Houston. When you get to a break 
point, I have some words on what you can expect 
in the way of guidance steering. Over. 


Stand by. 


Okay, Gordy. You can go ahead and talk while 
we're putting our helmets and gloves on. 


Okay. We never got around to debriefing you on 
PDI, but the out-of-planeindications you saw on 
the AGS during descent were proper. We had 
changed your -your vector slightlM Just prior 
to PDI, and so the AGS was navigating and indicating 
properly. We Just ran the present ascent 
targets in the LMS with the half-a-mile crossrange 
as shown on the pad, and you're going to be steering 
south. That's the way the stearing direction 
goes. That's to your left, for Geno's benefit. 
And the crosspointer indicated a m_ximum of about 
13 feet-per-second out-of-plane velocity at about 
ignition plus 3 minutes and 50 seconds, and then 
came on back to zero. Over. That -that velocity 
was AGS velocity. 


Okay, Gordo.

Well, not very in Z; 15 feet per second difference. 
But it agrees with the AGS, if that makes you feel 
any better. 


Hello, Houston. You were looking at our NOUN 81s 
on the recycle. That's 17 marks. 


Roger, Challenger. And what it was on the APS 
there, we saw an indication, probably due to a 
temperature shift, which was a possible indication 
of unbalance in propellant usage there. And it 
was sort of confirmed by an increase in the roll 
moment offset, so we just played the conservative 
thing and terminated ascent feed. 


Okay, Gordy. Thank you. I was just curious 
exactly what it was. 


Okay, and it's no problem for our TPI on the APSe.

much your next rev. So sometime during this rev, 
give me a call, and I'll read it up to you. It'll 
be -it'll start just about the time the next rev 
starts. 
CMP Okay. We'll give you a call on that, Houston. 
CC Okay, Ron. 
LMP Houston, America. Magazine Dog Dog is 40 percent 
remaining. 
CC I copy that. 
07 23 31 23 CC Okay, and, America, we've got a pitch of minus 67 
and a yaw of 300 for the high gain. 
LMP Okay, Bob. Let me have the old Flight Plan 
changes. 
CC Okay. At page 195, excuse me -time 195:15 -
that's page 304. 
LMP Go ahead. 
CC Okay. It says, "Set HIGH GAIN MANUAL, WIDE" and 
the new angles will be pitch of minus 5 and yaw 
of 315. And the time will be 196:30 instead of 
21: 30. 
LMP Go ahead. 
CC Okay. You might also at that point write in 
"Verify all command module VHF OFF." I'm sure 
Ron will understand what that mear,s. He's been 
doing it all along anyway. 
LMP Yes. 
CC Okay, and then over at 195:31 -

That Just means you want the VHF off, doesn't it? 


Right. All of these, I think -three switches 
over there along the side. And BEACON, RANGING 


and 


I think I understand that. 


Okay. I thought even an I24Pwould understand that. 
At 195:31, we're going to move "LUNAR SOUNDER 


OPERATE to OPERATE." The new start time there 
will be 195:31:38. Over. 


Okay. "LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE" will be done, new 
time will be 195:31:38. 


Okay. And then next page at 196:20 which was the 


original lunar sounder stop time, we will move 
all that block which starts with "LUNAR SOUNDER 
OPERATE STANDBY and T-stop" -that will all move 
over -and goes down to "UV ON." _laat block will 
move over to the 196:30 time of the next column 
and the T-stop time there will be 296:30. 


Okay. I'm going to move the "LUNA2_ SOUNDER 
OPERATE/UV ON" block from its present position to 


196: 30:00. 
Okay, Roger. 
And the "VERB 22 NOUI 79" that was 


originally starting at 196:30 will be done follow


ing that block of "LUNAR SOUNDER SIM bay" stuff. 


And, Jack, there -


Okay, Bob. 
Is there anything else? 


Okay, in the 
middle of that section that we moved, 


it says "Acquire STDN," says "High gain angles," 


and those will again be changed to minus 5 and 315 


which is the 
same change we made on the earlier 


page. 


Okay. 


Okay. And that is the extent of the update. 


Okay, thank you.

CC Okay, and then, how about you three guys giving 
us -giving some consideration the next 2 or 3 minutes 
to the following proposal? One, we totally 
aborted that lunar sounder pass because: One s we 
couldn't get the HF antenna out; and, two, because 
the temperature in the film cassette was too iow. 
Those things are both taken care of now. And 
they're talking down here about essentially starting 
over at 197 hours, which will be the top of 
the next page, and pretending tha_ that's 195 hours 
and running through that 195-hour page, beginning 


Tape 129/8 
at 197 hours. The only problem with that, of 
course, is that it runs into your eat perioi and 
destroys that, _ich essentially means that you're 
going to get to bed 1 hour later. And I guess what 
we're saying is_ if you're going to get to oed 
1 hour later an_rway, we might go ahead and ask you 
to do it_ if you're agreeal_le. If you're clean-upcleaning-
up companions there have progressed far 
enough that you think you're going to get to bed 
on time and don't want to do it_ then that's another

will be 197:31:38 then, right? 
CC That's affirmative. 
08 O1 59 02 CC Okay, Ron, and two comments on that. Let me make 
a couple of other amendments to that. One, the 
lunar sounder operate time, instead of being 31:38 
will be 32:51. At that 195 -top of the right-
hand column on 195 there -be 195:32:51. Over. 
CMP And, Houston. These waste water dump and fuel cell 
purges -that doesnTt foul up the lunar sounder, 
as I recall. I don't think, does it? 
CC Oh, we can go ahead and do those in parallel, right. 
C_ Okay, good. That's what I thought. 
CC And, Ron, one other -Did you catch my one -my 
32:51 update, there on that start time? 
C_ Did you say cancel it? I'm sorry. 
CC No, do you copy. I gave you 195:32:51 as the 
start time, instead of 31:38. Did you copy that? 
C_ Yes, I copied, I'm sorry. Used to working in VOX 
all the t_me and I forget to push the button. 
CC Okay, and the other thing we'd like to keep you 
aware of, if you hadn't noticed it, and that is 
that this thing, of course, Ron, is originally ... 
to a 196:30 plus, which means that you're going to 
be running 198:30 plus, which kind of looks like 
you're going to be eating at least a half an hour 
into your sleep period, at the very least. Over.

fine, Ron. And, we'd like to get H2 


tanks 2 and 
3 FANs back ON. 


2 and 3 are ON. 


Okay. 


Hey, Bob. A 
quick summary on that rendezvous as 


far as MM performance was concerned. Handling 


characteristics were outstanding and pretty much 


the same as they have always been on LMs in the 


past. The APS burn-burn went nominal; the 


residuals on 
that one were actually quite big, 


about 744, that's feet per second -and we nulled 


those out and after that the midcourses were max 
of 1.3, then a max of 1.6 on the second one. But, 
after the TPI, we were coming up -up the pike 


right -over -right -all the way in the lineof-
sight rates -actually both out of plsme as well 
as in plane were -were zero -basically zero for 
out of plane and, as predicted, on a nominal curve 
for in plane. And it really ended up to be pretty 
much a storybook rendezvous. 


Okay. You wemt to give me that TPI again or did 


you already pass that down to ground? I didn't 


copy the residuals there? 


No s i didn't tell them that. And we didn't get a 
chance to copy them down because I wanted to get 
them ail down on tape. It surprised me a_er the 
APS burn because they were relatively large. They 
were 7 feet-per-second in X, 4inY_ and4inZ. 
._nd that was, I guess, just short of a 4-second 


burn somewhere around 4 seconds. 


Okay, copy that. 


And one other 
little thing, we put, i think, two 


marks, three 
marks -two or three marks in the 


AGS -manual 
marks_ after the last mldcourse, as 


we'd been doing in the simulator -three marks, 


and Jack teils me thaz vhe razige rate came right 


up vo -rlgh_ 
up to the actual radar-rar_ge rate 


right up to i00 fee_ or so.

Okay; and, America, if you have time, I have a 
few news items to read up to you here. 


Go ahead, Bob. 


Okay. Dateline Washington, the United States 
today threw its support behind the Christmas Peace 
package proposed by South Vietnamese President 
Nguyen Van Thieu, who accused North Vietnam of 
using high-pressure tactics in an attempt to impose 
an incomplete peace settlement. American representatives 
at the Paris peace talks, told the 


Communists it was futile for them to continue 


clamoring for the signature of the cease-fire 
agreement drafted in October by Kissinger and 
De Due Tho. In Kansas City, the condition of 
former President Harry S. Truman weakened to, 
quote "very serious" Thursday. His doctor says 
vital signs are stable, but former President 
Truman was unable to speak; his lungs were filling 
with fluids still, and his kidneys have been impaired. 
In Mexico City, the International Federation 
of Airline Pilots, meeting in Mexico City this 
week, has promised a worldwide stoppage of all 
transportation industries if the governments do 
not take action to stop hijackings. In New York, 
the United States won an apparent victory in the 
United Nations when the General Assembly voted 


an approval of a cut in U.S. contributions to the 
world organization. Vote was 81 to 27, and reduces 
the U.S. budget assessment from 31.5 percent to 


25 percent, starting in 1974. Here at home in 
Houston, the city council voted to locate the new 
proposed sports arena in the Greenway Plaza. The 
vote, however, stipulates that the Mayor find a 
way to finance it without using city tax funds. 
Council indicated that if the Mayor can't do this, 
the city will abandon plans for the 10-milliondollar, 
18-thousand-seat facility. On the lighter 
side, in Jersey City, only one of 51 -that is one 
of 51 women who took physical exams for the police 
department, passed. Police Director Frederick 


Stevens said 24 of the women were too short, seven 
were underweight, and four did not have eyesight 
that could be corrected. In sportS, the Alberta 


Oilers, that's Alberta and not Houston Oilers, 



Tape 130/9 
these are the hockey ?nes, skated past the Houston 
Aeros for a 3-to-2 victory here in Houston. And 
the Minnesota Vikings, in the city of Minneapolis, 
came to terms on a lease agreement to play their 
games in a proposed stadium up there in the north, 
or I guess it's building a stadium to keep it from 
being too cold, instead of being too muggy like it 
is down here. And that's the news; as you can see, 
it's a slow newz day and things are still moving

And I was Just reminding you that we don't want to 
be hosing it overboard right now because the UV 
and IR COVERs are OPEN, and we presumed that, 
since you'd already done the waste water and the 
H2 purge on the back side, that -that sufficient

we sort of presumed that you weren't in the mode 
of dumping urine overboard.

No, we've got Nell back there and a whole new team 
since you went to bed. 
Oh, that's right. Very good. 
Who selected that song, Joe Allen? 
No, that's -that's Nell's special. You've got 


Nell Hutchinson to blame on that one. 


I must say he had a lot of accomplices on that, 
tOO_ SO 


Yes, Bob, I think maybe that's one of the best 
songs that's come out in the last l0 years, if you 
ask me. 


Roger. 
But then, you didn't ask. 
Hey, Houston; America. 


Go ahead [ 


I think mag QQ is all gone. Shall I use the RR? 


Hey, Ron, at 208 -


...or something-


--05 there, 
we're going to delete that solar-


corona pass anyway. I've got a Flight Plan update 
I'll give you at 208 there, and we're going to have 
to delete that solar-corona pass. 30, forget it. 


Okay. 


In case you guys are wondering, it looks like we 
finally might see the Sun down here in Houston. It 
is clearing off, except it's extremely cold. The 
temperature must be hovering right in the iow 40's, 
or maybe even the high 30's, or even lower. 


Well, my goodness. I should have been watching the 
weather for you, Bob. We'll come and warm things 
up for you before long.

do the solar corona, and we've already told you 
that. We'll get back with you later on that. If 
you want, I'll read you the morning news. 
08 13 22 16 CMP Hey, okay. Go ahead. 
CC Okay, there's been a temporary halt to the peace 
talks in Paris, and, as we mentioned before, Henry 
Kissinger is in Washington andhas conferred with 
President Nixon. A cease-fire proposal suggested 
by South Vietnamese government officials has been 
rejected by the U.S. White House News Secretary 
Ron Zeigler has declined to characterize the present 
Paris peace efforts, but say -did say there 
are still some obstacles to overcome. And we had 
another hijack attempt. A youthful Canadian, who 
hijacked an airliner in northern Canada was talked 
out of his escapade by his father. The youth had 
held 62 persons aboard the plane for a short while, 
then retained only four hostages for l0 hours. It 
appears that the United Mine Workers may have a 
new president. Maverick candidate Arnold Miller 
retained a strong lead over Tony Boyle in the 
government-supervised election. The transatlantic 
airfare price war that seems imminent, prc_ises to 
be a real boon to the vacationer. It is now esti-
mated 
that airfare may be as low as $136.00 for 
the transatlantic fare in some special categories. 
Juan Peron has ended his month-long visit to Argentina. 
An attempt was made to nominate him for the 
presidential election while he was there, but the 
move was declared illegal and he returned to 
Paraguay. A few other news highlights -the village 
of Rhonda, Switzerland, is threatened by a 
half-million-ton portion of a glacier moving down 
a mountain. Willie Brandt has been sworn in as 
Chancellor of West Germany for his second term.

Former President Truman remains seriously ill. 
Chicago Mayor Daley has made an effort to halt 
further commercial development along Chicago's 
Lake Michigan waterfront. Comedian Bob Hope is 
set again for his annual tour of U.S. overseas 
military bases. His first Christmas show in the 


Far East is December 21. 


Now, in the local news, here, there's a good chance 
that Texans may soon legally put a bet down on a 
horse race. A state senate's studying -study committee 
has heard some heavy opposition to parimutuel 
betting in Austin, but the proposal appears to have 
a good chance of approval. And if you follow the 
Tomball police force, who quit in masses a couple 
of days ago -Tomball has rehired three of the 
officers who quit, and two more of the police who 
walked out are seeking to be rehired_ And Just a 


note here -there was a little beautification of 
Houston. Some of the thousands of billboards that 


line m-in highways around Houston will be coming 
down after the first of the year. All signs must 
be licensed by the state and a fee paid after that 
time. Some of the sports news: Johnny Bench, the 
Cincinnati Reds catcher who had a benign spot removed 
from a lung Monday, is recovering nicely at 
Christ Hospital in Cincinnati.The star baseball 
player will remain hospitalized for about 5 more 
days. Brad Van Pelt of the Michigan State University 
defensive star won the Maxwell Club trophy 
as the year's top college football player. The 
Washington Redskin's Larry Brown took top honors 
as the top professional player of the year. Southern 
Methodist has apparently chosen a new football 
coach to succeed Hayden Fry, but University officials 
say an announcement won't come until next week. 
Mark Spitz and Shane Gould, both top Olympic swimmers, 
were honored as top athletes in the world 
by European sports writers -for this past year, 
of course. There was no action last night in college 
basketball. The University of Houston is 
getting ready to play California tomorrow night. 
Joe Paterno, Penn State coach, has won the Walter 
Camp Football Foundation award as coach of the 
year. And it appears that Mike Tillamen of the 
Oilers may play out his option this year and this Coach 
Bill Peterson says that it upsets his draft

plans this ccming year. And I've already updated 
the weather to you. I just might add a little 
parenthetical thought that it's really not that 
much in the news and all the news around here anyway 
has been Apollo 17 and your lift-off. We picked 
up the lift-off last night from the Moon and carried 
it live TV for about 2-1/2 minutes as you 
went out of sight like a star, and then, of course, 
live TV picked upyour dockingand -rendezvous and 
docking. A very spectacular picture, I might add, 
of the lunar surface as the Challenger came up to 


meet America. Over. 


Very good news s_,w,nary,Bob. Thank you. I didn't 
realize Tc_ball had five policemen (laughter). 


America, Houston. 


America, this is Houston. 


Go ahead. 


Hey, you can probably tell by the comm that this is 
Jerry. This is -the Gold Team has been handed 
over to the able hands of Neil. Before things go 
too far, I'll be around watching for the rest of 
the flight, of course, but before things got too 
far I wanted to pass my comments on to you guys 
that -boy, this has really been super. You guys 
have -between the performance of you guys and the 
performance of the hardware, it's been a piece of 
cake down here. I hope it's staying that same way 
up there, and we're really looking forward to finishing 
this thing up and getting you on back home. 
Andmy hat's off to you. 


Okay, Jerry, I appreciate those words, but any performance 
of ours, and certainly that of the hardware, 
has to go all to the performance of you guys 
down there, because, you know, you are the guys that 
make it happen and we do appreciate it. And I guess 
this is sort of a semiretirement for you then, is 
that right? 


Well, I don't know whether to call it semiretirement. 
It's -it's a relaxed feeling, I'll tell you that. 
But I'm anxious to do it again and hope I get a 
chance to do something more like this.

and, listen, you couldn't have left it in a more 


able set of hands than Nell's down there. We'll 
have to celebrate your B-day or 4-day rest period

Roger. Talk to you later. 


I didn't -I didn't realize we wore you out. 


I will throw one thing right quick, you know the 
activation descent day, that was the third one I 
had handled, and including all the simulations and 
all the three of the actual flights, I think it's 
the first time we can say that we really did it 
all right. For one reason or another, it really 
turned out to be a fairly easy day and I was 
really surprised. 

Jerry,that spacecraft that we were workingwith 
was undoubtedly the best vehicle alongwith 
America that I'veever flown. 

Okay, well I'llbe talking to you later.

a Seconal. Fluids -he had lots of fluids -but 
they weren't logged. Okay, LMP's -okay day 10, I

coffee, fruit cake, meatballs, lemon pudding and

gravy that was really a beef and gravy. 
CC Okay.

squared, scrambled eggs, orange juice, and coffee, 
vitamins; Meal B -need some light (laughter) 
meal B is chicken and rice soup, meatballs with

candy, apricot cereal cubes, brownies -I guess 
that was it. Meal Charlie, potato soup, beef and 
gravy, the ambrosia peaches there -about half of 
it -four brownies, and an orange drink. Okay, on 
the medical log: PRD is 15047 and I had about 
6-1/2 hours of sleep in, oh, catnaps I guess -
some of them were a couple hours long. And had 
two sniffs of nose drops on each side prior to 
going to sleep and five cans of fluid. OkaV, for

Bob, in lieu of the solar corona photography, I 
watched -Gene and I both watched it set and there 
are two bands which I still can see now -a zodiacal 


light, I guess, going out s2_metrically on either 
side of the plane in the ecliptic and they make an 
angle between th_mnelves of about, let's say, 
70 to 80 degrees. I can still -knowing they're 
there -I can still pick up the bands, streamers, 
I guess would be a better word. And last night 
when I watched one set, there was a strong linear 



Tape 13'8/7 
streamer going out -oh, maybe 3 or b or 5 diameters 
I'll have to get my directions straight. Well, I'll 
figure out which side of the ecliptic it was. That 
was not nearly so strong when I looked this time -
now partly -that may be dark adaptation, I don't 
know, but I'll try to keep track of that one. But 
these two streamers today are about an equal 
strength and they're still visible as zodiacal 
light.

Ron, we're standing by. 


Okay, Houston on the -the craters is to the 
north of the Wright Brothers. The slope of the 
walls is steep -probably 45 degrees on the 
inside -it's a gradual slope on the outside sllpping 
away from the crater. There is no apparent 
albedo differences in the ejecta or patterned annulus 
around the crater itself and we're looking 
specifically at the one to the northwest of the 
Wright Brothers, now. There is a definite mare 
flow that is unindated [sic], and it's a different 
color and, you know, that you have a light albedo 
to it now, it's kind of a grayish tan. It's a light 
grayish tan material that has flowed -and I can't 


tell -it almost looks like it's flowed down to the 
crater. There is an impact crater right in the 
breach of the crater -which has nothing to do with 


the flow itself. The material in the -I'm almost 


out of sight of it already. I was going to say the 
material in the inner crater in these boulder ring 
structures down there -the materi_L all the way in 


the center of it is comparable to the h-mmocky, 
bumpy looking type stuff that is not really the 
mare -not the smooth mare of Smythli -but the 
other part of the mare of Smythii. 


Are there any differences in the cra_ers, Ron? 


Yes, some of the craters, though, you can't see the 
boulder-ring structures on it. And some of them 
that are definitely impact craters, you know, that

have the ejecta rings around them. I'vegot to 


study them alittle bit more. This is really the 


first chance I've had to look at smythii, on this 
pass, but I want to take a look at him a little 
bit more. Some of the boulder-ring basins there the 
walls are not delta shaped at all. The one 
to the north and let's see, as you look to the 
Wright Brothers there's one directly north, and 
then the next one, and then the next one. The 
one directly north we'll say is 12 o'clock; the 


other one is i o'clock; and then a 2 o'clock cra


ter. The 1-o'clock crater looks to me there is a 


high lava mark around the outer basin, the outer 
ring of the crater, itself. The one at 12 o'clock 


is the one I was talking about, has the breach on 


it with the later impact -the small impact crater 


on it. And without the binocs I couldn't tell 


flow direction, whether they were flowing into the 
boulder-ring basin from that mare patchon the 
outside or vice versa, so I'm going to try to check 


that out the next time around. 


Okay, Ron, we're standing by for any comments 


along your ground track here and we're following 
you. We would like to -when you get up on the 


landing site, we'd like you to concentrate on 


Stoney and F Cra -F Crater for those textural 


differences we noticed the other day. 


Okay. Shorty. I think -right, I called the 


Stoney the other day too I think but 


Yes, Shorty, I'm sorry. -


The one out on the landslide. 


--And we would like you to mark -Right. Will 
you mark -like you to mark the breach that you 


see on the photo, please. Or on the map. 


Okay. That's -that's the breach on the -in Mare 


Smythii.

you might want to make en route to the landing 
site, there. 


Okay. 


Well, again you can speak of test -or color differences 
on the thing. And the Sun angle now looking 
west -you get the same streaked -well, the 


verticle streaks that I talked about before that 


you see on the backside at the high Sun angle higher 
Sun angles again. And that seems to show 
up more and more, I think, at the higher Sun 
angles. And these are the -what I call -radial 


radial streaks down in the fresh craters that 


essentially 
start at the top of the crater rim 


and go down inside of them. If you take a look 


at these streaks, I don't -I don't see how they 


could be due 
strictly to the Sun angle on them, 


I think, because they're all the way around the 


crater. 


Roger, did you have a particular crater in mind

Yes. On the

of it right

which one it is. It's in all of the -all the

looks like the Sculptured Hills around the landing 


site. 


Roger. We understand that, Ron. 


Coming up on Apollonius. That area now is that

Yes.

Is there any significance or difference between the 
contact of Crisiumto the Highlands or at Picard in 
that -or at the area where you're flying over in 
the Mare Tran -Fertility and, the Highlands right 
there in between. Is there any difference between 
these two contact points? 


No, the Highlands look essentially the same as 
you -as you pass from Crisium on across to 
Fertility, and, again, they look so much like the 


Sculptured Hills, it's ridiculous, you know. It's 
all the high Sun -high Sun angle again. You 
got the streaks and the highs and there -there 


are masses of Highlands, though, on the border of 
Crisiumhere, though that -although they look 
like the Sculptured Hills, the sculpturing seems 


to be radially upslope and then downslope from 
the center of Crisium and Just in small local areas 
of the Highlands. 


Roger, Roger. Do you see any radial Fra Mauro like 
lineaments? 


In that way, I think you can see ... the Sculptured 


Hills. 


--Fra Mauro ...? 


No, Bob. What I'm referring to is on the Highlands 
bordering Crisium, but in about all of them you do 
see a definite radial pattern upslope and downslope. 
From the center of Crisium, but none of the lineaments 
like you're talking about like at Fra Mauro. 


Roger, copy. 


What kind of film we got? Oh, I got the wrong film 
in the mag. Right -Let's see, there's Yerkes, 
and then on the side of the slope, come Yerkes 
and then there's about a 50-kilometer crater, then 
there's a subdued crater, and right on the western 
rim of Crisium -in the western edge of that subdued 
crater, it's almost a 70-degree slope down there, 
and it's a square straight slope on the thing. 


_aere doesn't seem to be any eJecta piled up in the 
bottom of it at all, but within the slope -and it 
must be 50 -about -yes, 50 kilometers long, and 



Tape 139/6 
there's a bright impact crater on the top of the 
hill, top of the rim, right below that bright crater, 
you have the tannish brown streak that goes 
through the whole slide. The rest of the slope 
itself is the bright, light -real light, light 
tan, I call it. I'll find the name of that crater 
on the map in a minute, but --

In the early parts of it, I thought it was a dark 


grayish tan, I guess, or something like that. Now 


it looks to me like it's more tan -I mean more 


gray, I'm sorry, more gray. It has essentially 


the same-


I think if you use the binoculars on the landing 


site -


It has essentially the same -Ah, not yet. 


Yes, this is Gene. I've got it on and the streaked 
albedo changed differences very definitely. One 
is the dark mantle on the floor. One is the South 


and North Massifs and the other is the Sculptured 


Hills. And the Sculptured Hills are at a light 


gray albedo between the Massif and the dark mantle. 


This line is very evident and there's a definite 


break in slope that you can see between the South 


Massif the, I won't call it the slide, but the 


white mantle is out on the valley floor. And from 


here, Shorty stands out like a sore thumb. 


Okay, we're interested in all three of you on that 


color texture difference up at Shorty and then we'd 


like to have a comparison of Shorty to F-crater 


if it is possible. 


Okay, that crater is harder than a son of a buck 
to find. F-crater is right on Family Mountain, 
and there's one to the north of Family Mountain, a 


little ways there's a darker crater and then 
there's also one to the south of it. I can't find 


one on Family Mountain at all. I couldn't the 


other day so I'm going to see if I can find it 


today. 


Bob, to me the Sculptured Hills incorporate the 
albedo, both of the North Massif, or the massif 
and the mantle area and combine them to give you 
a generally in-between gray albedo, but the sculpturing 
is produced by the darker albedo that looks 


like the mantle, and the lighter albedo that looks 
like the massif. 


Roger. And for Ron, the F crater is just to the 


south of Family Mountain. It's the one that you 
mentioned south of Family Mountain.

Jack, Houston. We see no need for you to wear

Okay, Gordy. I've done that. Asd I'll wait

Okay. 


Gordy, how do you read IMP? 


You're loud 
and clear, Jack. 


While we're in a relatively quiet period, we're 
going to make a few comments about some of the 
things that cross the two big basins that we're 
getting very familiar with -or, actually, three: 
Smythii, Ori -Smythii, Crisium, and Serenitatis and 
the degradation of the balls of the major ring 
and the lack of any obvious blanket structures, 


I think, in contrast to Imbrium and Orientale, 
which we've also had a pretty good look at -


Orientale and Earthshine, on the earlier revs is 
quite striking -that contrast is quite striking 
-to me, at any rate. Also_ within Orientale s the 


-at least at the southeast -on the east-south


east portions of the mare floor, the wrinkle-
ridge system is not nearly as well developed; 
but there is a wrinkle-ridge system that roughly 


forms an inner floor ring, at any rate. 


Roger. 


The fronts of the major ring in Crisium are strikingly 
different than those of the Apennines just 
in their general slopes; sharpness of topographical 
features; and in any appearance of having even a 
hint of boulder fields on their slopes like we 


observed, say, on the South Massif, anything like 
that. At least Serenitatis massifs seem to locally 
show fairly major boulder fields on their flariks. 


And I haven't 
seen any around Crisium yet. Maybe

Ron's already talked to you about that, but i 
haven't seen any. 


Okay. 


Yes. The craters now. I'm speaking of the, Ron, 
of the front faces themselves, the rim -the face 
of the ring itself. 


Oh, I see. The face of the ring itself -okay; 
that's what you're talking about. 


Yes, yes. No it -a crater -a fresh crater in 


the mare or a fresh crater in the blanket area rim 
area -will have boulders, Gordy; don't misunderstand 
me. But the front faces -the ring 
front face does not have boulders -that I can 


see. And I think boulders are pretty obvious 
when they're there. We've seen them well defined 


on the central peaks of Tsiolkovsky, and I think 
any time you have a major boulder popu -field, 
you can see it with the monocular -with the 


10-power monocular. 


Roger. 


Getting into areas that resemble, in their surface 


texture, the Sculptured Hills of the Taurus-Littrow 


landing area, here we're just passing -Now where 


are we? -that would be (laughter) I got disorien


ted all of the sudden. Proclus is there, so it"s 


in the ray-excluded zone of Proclus where there is 


a mare surface projecting up into terrain that 


looks like Sculptured Hills. And that mare has 


a distinct bluish-gray color, in contrast to the 


regoiith associated with the Sculptured Hills 


between the Hills at least -which is a brown

hue contrast tomy eyes, at any rate.

structurally controlled distribution, the structurally 
-structural control being apparently related 
to the rims of -of old craters. For example, 
there are some Sculptured-Hills-appearing topographic 
materials that -again, in the ray-excluded 
zone, but out in Fecunditatis -we find the rim of 
a fairly large flooded crater -in Fecunditatis. 
And all of this may tie in with the possible 


possibility that we saw at the la_lding site, that 
Sculptured Hills are composed of _m igneous gab


broic rock. And these may represent local intrusions 
controlled by the structure of an old impact 
crater -extrusions controlled by the structure 


of the old impact crater. 


Roger. 


I've noticed -now I'm getting a good view of 
where in Fecunditatis there is a tannish -or 


let's call it more of a brownish-gray mare in 
contrast to bluish-gray mare in Fecunditatis itself. 


Roger. 


And in the walls of some -of a large crater I'll 
try to figure out which one it is in a minute. 
It's near the large crater that the Sculptured 
Hills define you can see in the east wall -or 
maybe northeast wall of that crater -an area of 
bluish-gray -material that is streaking the 
normal tan-gray of that crater wall. 


Roger. 


This is a kind of one-sided discussion. I wish 
i was there so I could take a more active part. 


That's all right. I just thought I'd fill in a 
few things. This isn't a good viewing attitude 
at all, and we get a few isolated views that may 
be worth commenting on. The contrast, in my eye 
anyway, between the three color units around the 
landing site is a -let's call it a medium bluish 
gray to gray for the dark mantle; a ligh_ blue-gray

for the annulus around Serenitatis; and, then, a 


tan-gray for the Serenitatis Mare proper. And, in 


Dawes, you cmn see -I think you can see that the 


overturned -or the -the rim materials are made 


up of the brownish-gray material, and the walls 


underneath those rims are the bluish-gray, which 


is the age relationship suggested by topography. 


That'd be the over -lower unit is forming the rim 


with inverted stratigraphy. 


Roger. 


The light blue-gray annulus is also the locus of 


most of the circumferential grabens, that Seren


itatis is noted for, is in that area. And that's 


nothing new. But, in one place, there's a very 


subdued, flooded crater which seems to control a 


a -arcuate projection -or, let's say, a circular 


projection -of the light blue-gray out over the 


tan-gray mare. Most of the major wrinkle-ridge 


system of Serenitatis, of course, is outside the 


annulus of blue-gray, except locally, and one of 


those places was in the -to the west of the Taurus-


Littrow site. Although that wrinkle-ridge system 


does -I can see now, as we look south of Seren 


in the southern portions of Serenitatis that 
wrinkle-ridge system does cross the contact between 


the blue-gray and the tan-gray. That's the light 
blue-gray and the tan-gray. 


Okay. 


The impression I've had in looking at all the mare 


where the wrinkle-ridge systems are developed is 
that they're a late feature. They -at leas_ at 
low Sun, and sometimes even at high Sun -they 


have a very -very sharply defined ridges with 
steep slopes on either side that seem -that, in 
general, give me the impression that they're constructional, 
possibly associated with some thrusting 
movement. 


In the vicinity of Sulpicius Galius, _here are

It's a light orange, obvi'ously, not a-that it 
but it's in contrast to the brown-gray of the dark 


mantle in the vicinity of Sulpicius Gallus. There's 


a good one right down there. Now, that one looks 
like a constructional cone that's orangish. And 
that's right out on a raised projection of the of 
the brown-gray dark mantle out onto the -out 


onto the light blue-gray annulus material. 


This southern and southwestern pol_ion of Seren


itatis has a general appearance of the Sculptured 
Hills, although the individual hills seem to be 
more widely spaced than around Taurus-Littrow. 


Once again, historically, we're passing over the 


landing site of Apollo , or near the landing site 


of Apollo 15. 


Tell Dave Scott that the north con,lex looks just 


as interesting as it ever did: It's going to remain 
with Emory crater as one of the unknowns of 
the space program for a while, I guess. 

Roger. 


Hey, Gordo, I've been looking at the landing site 
off and on the last few revs, and I'd like to get now 
that we've been there and back -your best 
guess of the exact position of what you think we 


landed_ because I think I've got it pinpointed 
pretty much so from here. 


Okay. Stand by 1. 


_,is is one of the first opportuni-_ies that Z've 
had to look closely at Archimedes, which is one of 
those craters that, in the early days of the lunar

CC 
08172301 LM_ 


Tape 140/9 


mapping program, helped establish some of the fundamental 
age relationships between the various units 
that were visible in the Earth-based photography. 
In this particular case, it related to the sequence 


of events that created Imbrium, cratered it, and 


then flooded it with mare. And Archimedes is a 


completely circular -closed circle as a crater, 


and it is filled with mare. And it, in itself, 
is superimposed on the -one of the main benches 


of the Imbrium crater. Now, to have mare filling 
that crater and actually filling all the depressions 
of approximately the same level in the vicinity of 


a mare -of a large mare region, it's one of the 
things that's suggested to many people that rather 
than single sources for mare lavas, you have a 
multitude of sources in a very fractured lunar 


crust. The ultimate source in depth, though, is 
still certainly a subject for controversy. 


Some of the ridge and valley structure of the 
Archimedes impact blanket is not covered by mare 


and extends to the southeast out onto the Imbrium 


bench. That was also one of the pieces of evidence 
used in those early days of photogeologic 
mapping of the Moon. You!ll have to excuse the 
reminiscing, Gordy. 


Roger. 


And, Houston; America. Frame 150 -151 and 152 


were taken of the Sulpicius Gallus region with a 


250 lens. 154 was taken at D-Caldera, and that's 
magazine Oscar Oscar. 


Okay, Ron. 


Gordy, I guess it was the crater Bessel in Seren


itatis that Ron and I were looking at last night. 
And I think he had commented on being layers in 
the ledges that were visible in the walls, and i 


certainly concur with that. Although we could not 


trace layers -individual layers from ledge to 


isdge, within a coherent ledge the layers were 


traceable; and, in one case, I'm sure i could

with Timocharis. It looks like it's -those 
ledges -any ledges that may have been present as 
a result of the Imbrium Mare have since disappeared 
by weathering. That's lunar weathering, of course. 
Of course, down here in the Imbri_ -southern 
Imbrium -is one of the better regions of the Moon 
to observe the wrinkle-ridge systems or mare ridges, 
sometimes they're called. And it's purely that. 
They're fairly sharply defined -quite sharply 
defined ridges that are wrinkled in their pattern -
sinuous would be another term. And with sharply 
defined slopes on either side of the ridge. Sometimes 
they are flat-top ridges; sometimes they are 
more like spines. And occasionally you see them 
that almost appear to have vertical slopes on one 
wall or the other. The whole impression that I 
have, anyway, is that they -there may be a 
combination of structure and folding of the surface 
of the mare -Construction on the surface

interesting that they tend to -wherever there

Okay. Roger that. 


So I guess what I'm saying is that essentially 
whatever molten material that's up around on the 
rim of the crater Tsiolkovsky has been -well, i 
want to say extruded -not extruded but pushed 


out, I guess, away from the crater sad has been in 
a semiliquid or semimolten state in its period of

flat-floored, flat-mare filled depressions that are 
around the crater until I get a chance to look at 
those the next time around. 


Okay. 


Say, Gordy, something that struck me, -something 


maybe everyone else has thought about, but I hadn't 
before. At the southeast corner of Smythii, there 
was a relatively large -several large somewhat 


subdued craters but with relatively steep sides 
to them. And next to this one was ELvery small, 
white, bright-haloed crater. And I watched the 
rays of this crater; and the southeastern rays 
draped over the slopes of this much larger subdued 
crater -draped over the walls, all the way 
down onto the floor. And as they draped over the 
walls, they obviously gave me a very good albedo 
change from the darker wall to the very much light


er colored. But as they hit the floor of the crater, 
they form patterns that are not only not 
unlike, but actually very, very similar, _o the 


light-mantled area that we have been referring to 
as a possible slide back at Taurus-littrow. _ne 
patterns as they drape down the inner slopes of 


the crater and onto the floor, I would be willing

the same type of things we found at Taurus-Li_row.

and the crater that's right above the rev 62 
there, you can see a bright spot on the northwest 
portion there. And that's the breach zone of that 
particular crater. The thing that's intriguing 
about that to me is that if you look at the inner 
ring, it's a gradual slope from the center -the 
center of the crater is lower than the secondary -
the secondary ring around the thing.

I'll be glad to read it to you. 


Right now, Gordo. We'd love to hear it. 


Okay. Let me start with the America's gear there. 
The -on the UV spectrometer, well, actually 
having to do with UV. During -back dur_Lng rev 38, 
they sent an Aerobee sounding rocket from White 
Sands, up, and it carried a UV spectrometer above 
the atmosphere and successfully acquired solar UV 


calibration data. Farside terminator shows there 


is a hydrogen atmosphere, but it is much less than 
had been predicted. The PI is very happy with 
the mode 4 maneuver. On the IR scanning radiometer, 
it's still performing beautifully, and the 
PI is getting lots of high-quality data, and I 
understand is ecstatic about it. On rev 33, the 
crater Kepler C showed up as a 132-degree Kelvin 
anomaly on a 94 degree Kelvin background after 


11.6 days of lunar night, the crater Reiner was 
a similar anomaly on that revolution, in iow 
orbit on rev 9, Kepler A showed a broad honspov 
corresponming to its ejecta blanket wi%h a sharp 
spike corresponaing to %he crater in nne cen_er. 
One coldspot anomaly seems to correspcnd to a

The data is consistent with distinct layering 


in the mare, as would be expected, where the mare 


flooded by successive layers of lava, although, 


they say other explanations are possible. They 


don't see that layering -indication in the 


highlands. Predicted topographic signatures over 


features such as craters and mare ridges have 


been confirmed in principal. Of course, as you 


know, until they get the film back they don't 


have -they can't really reach any definite con


clusions. On the cameras -the cameras, both 


cameras and the laser altimeter all appear to be 


performing very well. And everybody's especially 


happy with the solid laser altimeter performance. 


Okay, that kind of sums up SIM bay. Do you have 


any questions, that I could chase down, or should 


I go on with surface stuff? 


No, why don't you press on. 


That sounds good Gordo, press on. 


Okay. On the surface, the heat flow. These are 


these are little short Summaries, each written by 


the Pis or co-Is (sic) on each experiment. Mark 


reports that the entire heat flow system is work

2.3 meters, and are nearly at their final temperature. 
for comparison, at Hadley Rille, we found

a low noise figure. The LE_M will be off ur.viZ

ascent clearly recorded on all four geophones. 
And apparent seismic velocity measured across the 
geophone array was 100 meters-per-second. Regoiith 
velocity was very close to that measure at 
the Apollo 16 site. The LM impact was clearly 
recorded on the geophones, and the estimated distance 
was 10 kilometers away, in the South Missif, 
actually very close to the targeted point. Although, 
I guess you've discussed this, we didn't 


see it on the video. The first charge went off 
while you were on the backside, last re_, and it's 
very apparent on the tracers which I'm ]%onitoring 


right now. I think the next one's due sometime 
within the next 2 hours. Okay, the lunar mass 


spectrometer -the low voltage circuits of the 
LMS have been operated briefly. All monitors 


indicate the proper performance of the instuments, 
but application of high voltages will await lunar 


sunsets when both the analyzer and the site has 
had time to outgas. Temperature of the radiator 
plate is slightly above nominal, but not so high 


as to be even important. That was from Dick Hodges. 
Okay, here's a little sl:mmary from Dave Strangway 
on the SEP. He starts out by saying, "Water, water 
everywhere and plenty to be found," because you 
didn't get behind the time line. The SEP transmitter 
was confirmed to be working well at the 


correct power level, using the lunar sounder. The 
receiver heased well above predictions during the 
whole mission, as i'm sure you are aware, but the 

two prime data legs were operated within the temperature 
limits of the recorder, and we have no 
reason to doubt that we got good data. There is 
also a good chance that the legs on station 4 Lo

Gravity measurement made during the three EVAs 
showed a large negative anomaly of about 
minus 38 milligals at the base of the South Massif. 
A similar negative anomaly of about minus 30 at 


the base of the North Massif. Preliminary con


clusions of the traverse gravimeter meas -TGE 
measurements indicate that the material under the 


valley floor of Tarrus-Littrow is m_ch denser than 
that of the North and South Massif. The gravity 
values will support the hypothesis that the valley 
subfloor consist of dense basaltic rocks, perhaps 


as much as 3 or 4 kilometers in thinkness. The 


extra measurement between stations 2 and 3 will 


be of great help in determining the nature of the 


boundaries of this basaltic layer and the va_-ied 
extension of the massif. The cosmic ray detector 


actually, you know as much as we do about the data 


return from it, of course: but the -we did -re


cover it earlier in EVA 3, as you remember, and 
that was due to a minor increase in low-energy 
solar protons and heavier particles detected here. 
And a reduced exposure will not offset the scien


tific results. 


The neutron probe was exposed to the surface for 


49 hours. PI estimates that the distance from

briefing, I'd like to give it to you now, so you

CMP Okay; go ahead there, Gordo. 
CC Okay, what we want to do is see if -This was 
triggered off by your observation of orange material 
last rev, I guess, and possibly earlier. But 
the idea here is to look for some craters that 
we've identified on photographs that are in similar 
geologic setting to Shorty Crater and see if we can 
see orange material around them. We're trying to 
determine if the orange material at Shorty is a 
one-time special occasion or whether possibly it's 
common to the area and just never been noticed 
before. And we think you'll be able to determine 
this visually, better than any other way. So, if 
you can get out the orbit -the orbit charts; the 
orbit photographs; let's see, the Lunar Landmark 
Maps for the CSM, and turn to the landing site 
number 2 or 4 piczure. Let me know when you get 
that, and I'll show you where we think a likely 
point is to see craters that are similar in settin_ 
to Shorty, to look for orange material.

passes with the binoculars over the dark mantle

at least most 
of the crater is that way. We looked 


at Shorty today, and Ron said that even the little 
bit of orange that he saw the other day is not

amount of orange we saw on the surface certainly 
would not be comparable to what we're seeing around

mare, very smooth mare floor on the thing. With 


two, -two old craters. And, that is definitely 


a younger flow than whatever made the polygonal 


crateriike depression. Right above the rev 62 


number. The thing that bothers me about that is 


that they, they almost -oh, looks like if you 


threw a rock in the mud, you know -made a mud 


pie, and you get a wave or a ripple going out 


from there. In other words, you've got a high 


wavefront going out from a circular direction with 


a slightly siopil_ up to that wavefront. That's 


on the inner ring on the thing. The outer ring, 


of course, is a typical-type ring that you get 


from an impact type of an operation. It looked 


like the rough-looking floors of those rings, 


ring basins, essentially have the s_ae albedo, 


the s_me characteristic_ as the rougher looking 


floor in the Mare Smythii itself. 


Okay, Ron. 


We'll take HiGH GAIN to AUTO. 


Okay, you have it. 


And, I took a picture of that one in Smythii 


is frame 160 on mag November November, and the 


reason I took the picture is really because on the 


western edge of the big basin it looks like there's 


a small impact crater, but it's only been dished 


out in the more recent flat dark-gray mare material. 


(Music in background) And looks like when it comes 


to the edge of the original basin ring, _hat part 


is not ejected out at all. So, essentially, you 


have a cone-type depression with an i_act crater. 


The material's only been excavated in the -in _he 


newer mare material. 


Okay, understand that. Say again, where that one 


is?

You know, Houston, we're jus_ passing over a little 
polygonal crater that's maybe 15 kilometers in 
diameter -15, 20 kilometers in diameter. It may 
be 10 to 15 -and down in the basin of it is a kind 
of a polygonal fill. It, again, has that dark 
greenish-black rock that is collected down at the 
bottom of it, and you also see it streaking down 


the side of it. But, I think one of the most 
significant features about the crater itself is 
that it has a swir!_ and these are honest to goodness 
-they look like swirls rather than rays. It 
has a swirl pattern around there -it's radial, 
from that most recent impact.

the more red-looking unit, or talus, is coming 
from below the orangish-gray material. But it is 
not a continuous horizon_ at least not so far as 
the talus indicates. It's local spots that are 
giving the reddish color.

And, America, as you can tell from the Flight 


Plan, we aren't expecting too much from you guys 


this rev. And we aren't expecting to send up 


too much to you guys either. A reminder that 


we won't be asking Gene and Jack for their PRDs 


tonight, but we certainly would like them in the 


morning. So you might take that into considera


tion. And we'll be sending you a few up-links 


there for the Flight Plan at 220, both the state 


vector and the EMi° 523. We also have a clock 


update for you -that we'll send up, and it's a 


0.04 seconds; so it's another biggie. 
Okay, Bob. We'll make an effort to get those 


PRDs. We can get one of them, probably, without 


too much trouble. But it's a case of restowing 


both those suits to get the second one, we're not 


going to get it until EVA day. I'm sorry, but 


that's it. 


We copy that. I guess they're back stored in the 


L-bag, huh? 


Yes, sir. 


Okay. And we'll want the onboard read outs there 
at the bottom of the page, Just before you go LOS. 
And I might pass up one little piece of news -very 


local news here -concerning us members of the 


Orange Team. We're all extremely proud that you 


and Jack chose to call the soil you found the 


other night, while we were on shift, the Orange 


soil because we take it as an obvious honor for 


the Orange Team to have been on shift at that 


point.

there, you do have two -You've got some LM sur


face film left, as I'm sure you're aware. And 
two mags in particular, which look fine to us, are 


mag Barabara and mag Karen. Barabara has 500 frames 


of CF,X, and Karen, 100 frames of black and white. 


Excuse me, 50 frames, not 500, of CEX. And 1GO of 
black and white. These mags have never been fit 


checked -on the command module cameras; but we 
believe that they will, along with -as long as we

number 1. And number 2, the focus Won't be quite

it will be satisfactory. So there's 150 frames 


there you might want to take advantage of in 


those two mags. We think those are in Romeo 2

we've got our hands on them. However, we -Bravo

And just in case you got some left over, I want 


to shoot some of that black and white on the Moon. 


We got some instructions for you, which we can 


call up in real time, if you want to do it 


different exposures. The CEX will be the same, 


of course, as the CEX that's in the command 


module. 


Okay. Bob, what factor on the black and white 


would you use? 


Okay. Jack, if you use them, use them, use the 


same sort you have onboard for the CEX, but you 


cut the shutter speed by a factor of 2. So it's 


for instance, you'd use a 1/500 instead of 1/250 


and so forth. Over. 


Okay. 


Say, Bob, i don't think -At least i haven't 


heard anything concerning the home front for 


about 4 days. You haven't, by any chance, had 


any contact, have you?

been a continuing item here during the flight In 
Kansas City, former President Harry S. Truman's 


condition continues to deteriorate as doctors are 


unable to restore his vital kidney functions. 
On the Paris peace talks scene, there has been 
essentially no apparent further developments 
today. It continues about the same. And in New 
York, police are red-faced, it says, when it was 
learned that more than 50 pounds of heroin originally 
seized way back in 1962 -this is part of 


the French Connection business -has been stolen 


from the police building where it was being kept 


as evidence. And a last local news item. Three 


prominent Houston men are missing. They were last 
seen in person at Cape Kennedy in Florida on 
December 6 but were apparently lost among the 
500,000 people who watched the launch of Apollo 17. 
The following appeal, it says, is issued in case 
they are listening: "Gene, Jack, and Ron, -come 
home. And if you pass a fellow with a bushy white 
beard and crimson suit, advise him you'll be home 


before Christmas." That's the extent of the news. 


We saw him the other morning briefly, Bob. And 
all four of us will be around at the right time.

day from the Moon. 


Okay. Here is a summary of _he late news as compiled 
in the MSC Public Affairs Office. if you'd 
like it, we're ready to go with it. 


Okay, we'd love to have it. Go ahead. 


Okay, everyone -everybody is talking about the 
success of Vhe Apollo 17 mission here in Houston, 
and the weather. It was cold this morning. Some 
thermometers in the Houston metropolitan area were 
in the mid-20's. The lowest official temperature 
for the city of Houston was 31. I might add 
Ellington had a recorded 29. A huge high pressure 
system is dominating the midsection of the 
nation. Barometric pressure reached a high of 


30.7 in the Houston area this morning at about 
5:00 a.m. With strong gusty winds, the chill 
factor was a 5 above in Houston, and about a 
minus 10 degrees in Galveston. Man, that's cold. 
The national Christmas tree was lighted last night 
in Washington by Vice President Spiro Agnew. A 
small crowd, braving cold and rainy weather, 
watched as the Vice President threw the switch to 


light up the 70-foot spruce that came from Medicine 
Bow, Wyolming. During the ceremony, Mr. Agnew 
said we must remember the many servicemen who are 
missing in action or prisoners of war in indochina 
and pray for them this holiday season. North 
Vietnamese peace talk negotiator Le Duc Tho has 
told newsmen he is very optimistic about prospects 


for an early cease fire in Vietnam° Before leaving 
Paris, Le Duc Tho said he will remain in very 


close contact with Dr. Henry Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger 
is in Wasain_on_ A Paris radio svation 
has said a oeace paco signing is imminent, _uv the 


report has been denied in Washington. Former 
Treasury Seereta_ 7 John Connaily says ne expects 
to get a call from President Nixon shortly to carry

21 men in West Virginia. The blast occurred at a 


steel-m_<ing complex near Weirton, West Virgina, 
on the Ohio River. President Nixon has given the 
green light for a pay raise for all Federal em


ployees. The across-the-board increase of 5.14 percent 
}nil! benefit both civilian and armed forces 


personnel. A 747 jumbo jet_ while taking off our 
of Miami international yesterday, went through 
a flock of birds and reportealy lost -had an 
engine go out. The pilot turned the aircraft 


around and went out o_er the Atlantic and burned 


down some fuel and landed at Miami, but skidded 
off the r.unway_ hit a concrete culvert, and sheared 
the nose gear. A few passengers fainted, but only 


4 were injured when they went down the slide.

The samll community of West,_ood_ Kansas, a suburb 
of Kansas City_ will send back a check it has received 
from the Federal goverr__ent in the Federal-
revenue-sharing program. Major Joe Dennis said 
Westwood just didn't need the money. On the regional 
and local scene -I just might add -i see 


it's not here_ that President Truman's condition 


seemed to deteriorste some last night, but he is 
still not listed on the cri-_ical list, he is 
serious. Miss ima Hogg, the 90-year-old founder 
of the Houston Symphony, was honored at a gala 
birthday party last night and cake-cutting ceremony 
at vhe s_uphony. And lJtt!e Tomball, Texas,

Roger, Ron. We_ve been chasing a data dropout 


glitch and we just wonder -trying to cover all 
bets. When you were extending HF ANTENNA 1, could 
have you gone to operate on the immediate switch 


next to it, which is the LUNAR SOUNDER switch 
which was right next to 17 Could you have gone 
to OPERATE for a minute or 2 without realizing 


it while your hold -holding 1 to EXTEND? 


Stand by, Bob. Which extension anomaly are you 


talking about, the one prior to rendezvous? 


No, the one after rendezvous and docking when we 
were putting them -they're out now and when we 
put them out -when we were putting them out and 


were extending HF ANTENNA 1, the LUNAR SOUNDER 


OPERATE switch is immediately next to it, and I 


realize HF _NTENNA 1 is a momentary switch. When 


you were holding it there, could you have gone to 


OPERATE on that LUNAR SOUNDER switch? 


Bob, I don't think so. I -no. No, I don't 


_hink so. 


Okay, we'll keep track of that. 


I would have had to -I would have had to been 


gone -I would have had to been gone to the 


OFF position too, I guess, right after that, and 


I think I'd remember that. 


Yes, that's affirm. You would have had to go to 
OFF, there. And I didn't feel it, but Joe needs you 
know we got a data glitch -it's nothing 


serious -no problem -but shay're just back there 
trying to track down all li%tie glitches and tha_ that 
seemed to be the only thing that could add 
up right now.

LMP Okay. I'm looking right down the slope of the 
South Massif, above the slide right now -right 
down at the -just about the angle of the slope. 
Amd there's a very slight indentation in the slope, 
just opposite the maximum -the point of maximum 
extent of the dark -light mantle. Opposite other 
portions of it, though, it -there's no clear indication 
of any change in the direction of the 
Massif -front, it's very, very slight, and i'd 
say you'd have a hard time saying that it is a 
source area for the light mantle but it's -there's 
a slight indentation.

And that blue-gray is comparable to the blue-gray 
that's visible in the craters such as Sherlock in 


the landing area. And along the graben, in the 
vicinity of those five craters, there is a series 


of very black spots, I'm going to have to look at 


again on the next pass, if we can. I don't have 


any idea what those spots are, but I'm looking 
very obliquely now to that graben and it's 


extremely -black spots along that graben.

Looked like to me. But -they slope up. But 
the rims of those craters and even the interior 
rims on ones ghat are multi-ringed, they slope 
upward from the center of the crater toward _he 
rim, and a gradual slepe, and then they drop off 
on the outside of the crater rim, sloping down 
from the outside crater up to 45 degrees. And 
then at some points on there, it almost looks 
like it's a real classic delta-shaped rim on them, 
where you have the same slope on the inside as

that looks like it's got a reddish dike in it and 
it's on -in the -again in the Haemus Mountains 


to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. 


Houston, a little more on that. It's an impact 
crater with a line essentially across vhe dis_.eter 
in a east-west direction, maybe a little bit north 
of west direction and the ejecta to the north of 
that -just went under us -the ejecta to the north 
of the line is the orange -actually more red-brown 
than orange, although there are both hues in it -


Roger, Jack. Can you give us some scale on that 
crater? 


--looks similar to -Yes, it's about a 600-meter 
crater. And it looks very much like -in it's 
geologic pattern to the -that crater out in the 
Nevada test site on Buckboard Mesa that had an 
explosion along a contact between two very sharply 
contrasting rock types. In this case, however, the 


line does not go completely across the crater, and 
that's why we feel it may be a dike or a vein which 
fortuitously has been hit by that impact. 


Okay; can you give me a little relationship with 
respect to Sulpicius Gallus, the crater? 


Yes, I'll try to spot it in a minute.

mapped as da_'kmantling are distinctly brownish

that's actur_ly what we're seeing. And in -i'll 
mark the place on the map, but it looks like i_ 
extends goout a sixth to an eighth of the way up 


the highest peak. It's quite a striking and obvious 
mark. There's a major textural change below 
the mark of a little scarp that defines it, 


the texture is very smooth. Above that it has the 


lineated and typical mountain front texture for the 


Apennine -for the Imbrium range. 


Roger. 


Bob, I might summarize my impression of the rilles 
in the vicinity of Euler and their relationship to 
the mare ridges. I've been able to, over the last 
day -just generally searching it out, I've been 
able to find rilles that clearly cross and separate 
portions of ridges. And ridges that clearly cross 
and partially bury rilles. And in another third 
case, a rille that appears to be levied -that is, 
have banks of -flat banks on either side, but 
near the end of it, it transitions into a mare 
ridge, very clearly. It looks as if, to me, tha_ 
the rille and ridge problem in here is Just one 
of repetitive compression and extension within the 


surficial flows of the Imbrium Basin. And that 


possibly during the compressive stages, there were 
extrusions locally along the ridge system, but in 
the main part, the ridge systems represent, I 


think, a doming it looks like just a doming of the 
mare surface except for these local ridgelike 
extrusions. 

Roger. 


I might also add that the rilles, to me, seem to 
be made up of zigzag straight line seg_.ents ra_her 
than being truly sinuous. They appear sinuous 
because of the rounding of the corners_ but in my 
impression is that they're really made up of 
straight line segments.

attitude and then we'll jettison the antennas 
at 235:43, and, of course, we'll have to bring -ap

moat between the inner ring and the outer ring 
and then it slopes, again a gradual slope from 
the center of the crater up to the first basin 
ring and with a steeper slope on the outside of

a fairly striking graben on the very north edge 
of Fecunditatis, south of Crisi_n -just south of 
Crisium. And it starts in the west within the 
Fecunditatis Mare and then curves gradually up 
through the Sculptured Hills structure to the 
north. And, there's a crater, looks like a 
subdued impact crater, right on that structure, 
and you can see the trace of the graben down vhe 
walls -the west wall of the crater and ur the 
east wall. And it does -from directly overhead, 
it appears to taper downward. The walls of the 
graben, thav is, get closer together as it 
approaches the bottom of the crater. And on the 
south wall of the graben_ as exposed in the west 
wall of the crater, there's a fairly sharp -
sharply defined white area in the talus.

Speaking of grabens again, on the southeastern 
blanket of Tar_untius, about a crater radius 


outward, _here's a crater looks like an impact also 


on a trace of a graben, and in this case the ejecta 


blanket that extends out along the graben both to 
the west and to the east is noticeably blue gray 
against the tan gray of the Fecunditatis or at 
least the Taruntius eJecta blanket. Basically, 
it looks like blue-gray wings on the crater along 
the direction of the graben. 


Roger, Jack. 


Looking at the crater svratigraphy in the northeastern 
and northern portions of Tranquility, i_ 
looks as if you could say that there are blue-gray 
mare materials overlying very light gray material 
of some kind. And without any strong exceptions 


that I've seen and it resembles the same stratig


raphy that i thin_ i talked about yesverday on 
the annulus of Serenitavis and that goes along 
with what I think Ron told you, that the visual 


appearance of the annulus and the northern 


Tranquility Mare, on the surface is indistin


guishs_le. 


Yes, that's right. 


It also suggests that the mare in here's relatively 


thin if you're getting down to whatever the 


basement rock is and that's being represented by 


the light gray. The legends [?] of the blue-gray 


material are high up in the crater ana really 


appear to form only about -oh, a fifth to a sixth 


of the wall height. And I_ii give you a crater 


There's a crater right between the two Cauehy 


rilles that shows this fairly we_l. A_a Ross 


Crater also shows it a iitt±e farther along, i 


remember from last time. 


Cauchy Craver, isn't it? 


Yes, Cauchy Craver is the one Z was talking abo_t 


that's be%ween %he two rilles. Actually, iv's 


not as well defined in Cauchy as it is in scm_ 


of She other cravers.

the west of the crater Cauchy that locally changes 
to left lateral. 
CMP And, Houston, even at the high Sun angle here, the 
ejecta of the -oh, four or five recent craters 
around Maraldi, still kind of a bluish-gray, 
light-bluish-gray. The floor of the crater 
Maraldi is essentially a dark -more of a dark gray 
today, I guess, than anything. And the ejecta 
patterns on that are the same albedo and color 
distinctions as the ones in the landing site. 
And, the landing site itself, from this angle, 
I think is going to -No, once we get up at the

we cannot recognize very readily on Earth because 
of the dynamic processes of mountain buii_ing and

Back when you had the tube on it, I -I really 


think -I knew we were looking in the right spot, 


but you know it was just blurry enough that -you 


couldn't be sure of exactly what you were looking 


at. 


Gordy, let me -since I don't have anything else 
to do right now, apparently, I'll see -tell you 
a couple of things I see right here. The annulus the 
dark annulus around Serenitatis, does not look 
complete in -in the due-north area. Oh, there're 
little partial pieces of dark material up there, 
but the main part of the annulus seems to cross 
into the mare region that's north of Serenitatis, 
and I can't remember the name of that right now. 
But it very clearly crosses right over there as a 
band and then dies out in that north region. 


Roger. 


Okay, Houston. There's the torquing angle. 


Okay. We copy. 


Okay. And I'll torque at -it looks like 


at 238:10. I guess you really don't care, though, 


do you? 


And, once again, albedowise and hue -color-huewise, 
the -that annulus is the same as at Tranquility, 
and essentially the same as most of 
Feeunditatis. The areas -although Tranquility 
and Fecunditatis are mottled ... with tan colors, 
the -that mottling seems to be local and, probably 
in large part, related to rays that cross those 


those seas. 


Roger. 


At this viewing angle, the dark mantle around 
Taurus-Littrow area is just a darker shade of 
blue-gray to me of the annulus, it's a -more just 
a medium gray, i guess. Whereas the Sulpic_us 
Gallus dark mantle is a brown-gray, quite aistinct 
in its color hue -to me, at any rate.

short of being 100 percent full. We can still 
see from Tsiolkovsky all the way across the Moon 
and it's just absolutely magnificent and I'm afraid 
we're talking here -that the pictures just won't 
capture the real three-dimensional picture we're 
looking at. But, uniquely with the binocs I can 
still see the light mantle in the landing area. 


Roger, Gene. 


Hey, Gordy, I don't know whether your camera 
people have anything to do this evening, but I've 
got a little problem for them if they'd like to 


work on it. 


Okay, go ahead. 


Well, it seems to me we're not only moving away 


from the Moon, but we're moving across the face, 
and I took a picture about 5 minutes ago of the 


Moon, and it seems to me we could take another 
one at some X-number of minutes and have pretty 
good stereo if we matched the printing of the 
two pictures in terms of scale. And, I'm wondering 
what's a good time elapse here for a good 
stereo of the whole globe? 


Okay, we understand the problem, but I'm not Well, 
we'll try. 


Well, I guess, if you could figure out what it 
would -how far we have to move across the face 


of the Moon and how long that would take to get 
about a -oh, shoot, a 30 to 1 base-heighth 
ratio'd probably be enough -20 to 1 would probably 
be better, obviously, but 30 to t, you could 
still see the stereo. And you ought to be able 


to figure that problem out. How fast do -do the 
guys know how fast we're moving across the face 
of the Moon?

09 21 44 55 CC Jack, this is Houston 
to your question. 
with kind of a crude answer 
LMP Go ahead. 
CC Okay, it turns out right now that you're not 
moving across the lunar surface very fast, and 
you -it's getting less and less -right now, I 
guess it's about a mile per minute. It would 
take a lot of minutes to get much of a stereo base 
since you're 10,000 miles out. But, remembering 
back to Ron's final picture there before you went 
to the UV attitude, after he asked the question 
about how high he had to be to fill up the 
80-millimeter lens, I think he took one at that 
time. We're thinking of combining a picture now 
with that picture, and then enlarging the one to 
get it to the equivalent diameter. And, some 
rough calculations of your longitude at that time 
and then -now, show that you've changed about 
21 degrees across the surface of the Moon between 
that picture and the present time, which comes 
out, if you take the average altitude between 
that time and now to -to about a 25-to-1 stereo 
base, as best I can figure. 
LMP Sounds good enough, Gordy. We've got it -I got 
that one at 5 minutes. I mean at 240 on the hour, 
so those are probably pretty close. 
CC I would guess, you know, that the angle of looking 
at it -other factors have changed sc much vhat it 
would be pretty hard to pull them together once 
you -even though you get the images reduced to 
the same size, but it might be interesting _o try.

for you on today's plans. At the present time, 
midcourse 5 is looking like a quarter of a foot 


per second, which means at the present time, we're 


not planning on burning it. But we reserve the 
right to change our minds sometime in the next 
hour and a half, if necessary. But that'll give 


you some thought to what to do today. 


Very good, Bob. Outstanding. We'll go along with 
whatever you want. 


You guys are getting easy.

been a serious hitch in the peace talks between zhe

telemetry to still be OPEN. Could you cycle it 


and see if we can get it CLOSED, or just give us 


what your onboard talkback looks like. 


Okay, Bob. I got it -I only got it to the intermediate 
position. 


Roger; thank you. 


Okay. in a real hair raiser at Candlestick Park, 


San Francisco, John Brodie came off the bench late 


in the game, in fact, in the last 2 minuves of the 


third quarter, and led the 49ers _o a 20 to 17 win 


over the Minnesota Vikings. The win gives _he 
Western Division crown to the 49ers in the National 


Conference. His -the last touchdown thrown was 


with 5 seconds remaining in the game. That outs 
the Washington Redskins, Green Bay, S_n Francisco_ 


and Dallas Cowboys in the NFC piayoffs and closes 


out the NFC contest. In the American Conference, 


tbere's one key game today to decide _he winner of 


vhe Central Division. Pittsburgh plays San Diego 
ana Cleveiana plays the New York Jets. Bovh 



Tape 167/8 
Cleveland and Pittsburgh will get into the playoffs, 
but their position in the standings is not yet 
known. One will be the wild-card team, one will 
be the conference -division winner. Miami and 
Oakland are the other teams in _he American Conference 
playoffs. Cincinnati plays here at Houston. 
And we'll keep you posted on that one. In local 
high school football, Baytown Sterling scored a 
major upset by defeating San Antonio Lee in the 
4A semifinals. The score was 21 to 20 and the 
game in the Astrodome before 26,000 fans. The 
loss was the first in 28 games for the San Antonio 
school. In basketball, the Houston Cougars downed 
California last night, 79 to 75. Some other major 
college scores: Kansas, 60, over San Francisco, 58; 
Penn State, 65, over Boston, 63; New Mexico State, 
69, Texas E1 Paso, 49; Indiana, 89, Ohio_ 68; 
Minnesota, 87, Loyola, 81; Florida State, 85, 
Baylor, 67. And in pro basketball, Houston defeated 
the Detroit Pistons_ 123 to 112.

your consumables, and just a real quick update. 
You're above the line on all your oxygen tanks. 
You're above the Flight Plan line on all your 


hydrogen tanks or right on the line. And you're 
3 percent above the line on the RCS. That's 
Flight Plan usage at this time, so you're above 
the line on everything. 


Okay, Houston. Thanks much. 


America, Houston. The M C&W on the FUEL CELL an 


02 FLOW HIGH is normal. 


Yes. I guess I finally learned that, Bob, and it 


didn't bother me a bit. 


America, Houston. While you're working on the fuel

Go ahead. 


We haven't heard any report from you on -and 
we're Just kind of curious. Have you had a lot 


of condensation moisture around the cockpit? 


Negative. No, it's been very dry. 


Okay; real good. Well, just a reminder; may not 
be applicable if you've got a good dry cockpit 


there. On 16 we had some -rather strange read


ings on the EVAP OUT temperature and a few other 
ones. And the potential is there for you to get 
those same readings -especially if you had had 


moisture -the potential is to get those readings 


at -afl.er depress, and we'll be watching it 
closely. I guess -I don't want to say just 
ignore them, but we'll be watching them and take 
any readings for after depress there with a grain 
of salt. And while you're at it, you might go 
dowr_ and zero the optics if you've got somebody 
in the LEB. 


Okay, Bobs stand by. We'll get that. Listen, the 
tunnel is dry up to the hatch. However, when you 
put your hand up in the tunnel around the -the 
edge of the hatch and on the -on the outer periphery 
of the hatch itself, there is quite a bit of 
moisture up there. We looked up there yesterday 
and couldn't find any, but there is some up there 
today. And the face of the hatch is slightly 
moist, but it's not -nothing like bubbles. 


Okay. Well, we just want you to be aware that 
you may see some extraneous ECS readings. It's 
no problem at all, but, you know, just wanted you 
to be aware of it_

is not like a crescent Moon. It's got kind of like

it makes almost three-quarters of a circle. Hey,

Hello, Jan. Hi, Jon. How are you doing? Hi, 


Jaime. Let's see, I'm supposed to rest, though, 


aren't I? What would you like to know about the

was kind of surprised when I saw it on this mapping 


camera -There was -the two -well, one's just 


kind of a steel plate there, and right on top of 



Tape 171/7 
the door, there's something with a piece of tape 
on it. And I thought that piece of tape came off 
before launch. 
CC Ron, just a couple questions while you're standing 
there resting. Is there any damage to the cable 
that the mapping camera -the cable between the 
mapping camera and the shelf? 
10 15 25 26 CMP-EVA Let me check on that one. 
CC Roger. Don't move and look at it. It was not 
that important. If you can see it, fine; otherwise, 
forget it. 
CMP-EVA Yes. Okay. I want to kind of take a look at it 
when I go by. There's Jack (laughter) Hey, how 
are you doing? You're looking right into the Sun, 
though, and I'm looking right at you. I should 
have a camera, and I could take your picture. And 
there -see the Moon back over there? That's a -
Well, that's the way it goes. Hey, it's clearer 
down here when you take that visor up. I hope I 
took the outside one. I mean the gold one. No, 
that's both of them, I think. Better leave it 
down. There we go. Yes, you take the outside 
one up a little ways and then you can really see 
down in the SIM bay. You know, that tape down 
in here is not scorched one bit. The whole side 
of the spacecraft is scorched like a son of a gun -
but the -you know, the panels, and everything. 
Man, there's bubbles, you know, on all that silver 
paint that's on here -is, you know, it used to 
be kind of a bright-looking silver paint. It 
looks like -it's in a shadow right now -but it 
looks like it's just been heated up one way or 
another. Yes, that's it up here between the SIM 
bay and the top of the service module. It actually 
looks like it's been burned, you .know. Not 
_ just a little bit warm, it's just kind of burned 
because it's bubbled. Yes. That's what you were 
seeing from the LM, I'm sure. And -but -as far 
as I can -it's kind of dark down the other side 
of the spacecraft -the other side of the SIM bay -
but it looks like the thrusters don't make any -


Tape 171/8 


hardly any marks on there. Now, I look -I look 
at quad A -the side of quad A thruster, though, 
and it's all scorched. So I'm not sure but what 


that might have been -what in the world could do 


that? Tower jett, do you suppose? I don't know. 


Might have. Well, let's take one of these covers 


off. Oh, this is -like it did in practice.

take with no luck at leveling the beam, and so 
they've decided to fall back and the whole team

it's a problem just in the leveling commands, or is 
it -it is receiving other commands, is that correct?

Okay. Does that mean that you might -Maybe you 
could ask Bob when you see him or something -does 
that mean the beam is not free, or is it not level? 


As I understand it -Stand by 1. 


Jack, I got a quick agricultural explanation of 
the problem. (Laughter) Evidently, it's the two 
plates betweenwhich the beam itself is suspended 
are adjustable, so that -by ground command, so 
that by driving these plates back and forth, they 
try to center the beam between them. And then the 


the data is initiated. When the beam vibrates be


tween the plates, it changes capacitance, or at 
least that's the general principle. And the problem 
is that by drive, they can comae-nd the plates back 
and forth and stop the stop, but they cannot get 
the beam to leave -leave one of the plates. It 


Just is hung up agains$ one plate, and this would could 
be caused by one of the wires that's sus-
Pended -sort of hang the beam, pendulum-fashion, 
being broken so that it has cockeyed off to one

malfunction at the moment. It's presently in use

useless in its prim-wyintended data-taking mode. 
Over. 


Right. Did they see the beam leave the plates at 


all as I shook it there near the last of our third 


EVA? 


I guess the answer to that is "no." They saw you 


Jostling it around and could tell where you were 


from the data but have no evidence that the be_l_ 
ever moved from the one plate. 


Isn't there any possibility that the telemetry is 
giving them a f$1se indication of not leveling -or 
not centering, I guess, would be a better word? 


Standby. 


No, Jack. Evidently, they've eliminated that possibility.

thought he might have seen. And we mentioned, I 
think, in response to that, about a i or 2 amp Jump.

we think they're probably due to minimum-impulse

We were discussing whether or not you needed an 
EMP or not. 


Well, there must be one for the situation. 


Getting a little quiet up here anyway, Gordy. 
That one sure snapped us out, though. 


Us also. 


Hey, how far are we from home? 


Well, I can give it to you in hours from entry 
interface right away -38 hours _2 minutes and 
seconds. And in miles, you're 1_3 500. 


Okay, thank you. 


Picking up speed all the way. 


America, Houston. Over. 


Go ahead, Gordo. 


I've been talking to Don Beaty and Dick Kruse and 
looking over a transcript of -of a science press 
conference we edited up. It was kind of ragged 


but possibly interesting summary of the science 


as it stands now. In response to your question 


of -of items that might help you prepare for 
tomorrow's press conference, I can come with you 
with those words any time you wish. 


... you can come up with them now. 


Okay. Let's start with the -the LSPE. All 


eight charges have now been exploded, and they 
were all on schedule and produced excellent signals. 
These data were used in conjunction with 
the ascent stage lift-off and also its impact 
data, which should give us an excellent picture 


of the geologic structure of the outer 3 kilometers 
of the Moon. This little summary I'm 
reading right now is -was written by Joel Watkins. 
The geophone array is functioning beautifully and 



f 


Tape 176/3 


and we're already talking about its potential in a 
listening mode for study of meteorite impact frequency. 
We still don't have precise EP locations 
from Ray Batson, so the following interpretation 


will almost certainly be changed when we get better 


data and field tapes, which we will use to refine 


our arrival times. Bearing the above in mind, 


my preliminary interpretation is as follows. The 
low-velocity layer seems to be thicker and higher 
in velocity than at either Apollo 14 or 16 sites. 
I think this may mean that the low-velocity layer 


here includes dark mantle material as well as the 


regolith. Details of the higher velocity substrata 
are fuzzy, but velocities increase with depth in 
a way which would be consistent with a thick accumulation 
of lava flows. This probably represents 
the suhfloor material. And he concludes by 
saying, "You guys did a great job, see you after 
splash." On the same subject, Dr. Kovach went 
a little further, and he just recently admits to 
seeing evidence of two high-velocity layers, 
especially after the 6-pound charge was fired, 
that -that evidence showed up. He also mentions 
in -mentioned in his press conference yesterday 
that the -the data point allowed by the -the 
ascent-stage impact was -was very important the 
fact that they -they got it in about 9 kilometers 
away and the -that data is right in a 
critical range where -where they see a big change 
in the -the percentage of -velocity change. I'm 
getting kind of balled up here in the words, but 
that data is very important because it's in where 
the steep gradient of velocity change occurs. 
On looking through here, t guess, in -in summary, 
I'll read a couple of sentences again out of the 
press conference. We do find evidence of lunar 
crust as we did in the past, but we may have to 
thin it considerably. We may have, in fact, have 
to thin it as much as to 25 kilometers instead of 
60 -that they believed it was up until now. And 
they're thinking they may have to lower the velocity 
of seismic ways -waves in the mantle, which, 
I guess, at last guess was around 9 kilometers per 
second. Now it's looking more like 7.5, and the 
crustal velocity is probably as low as 6.3 kilometers 
per second. Okay, yes. That was -that 
last data was really from Dr. Latham, and he was 



Tape 176/4 


LMP 


CC 


LMP 


l0230609 CC 


interpreting that data mainly from the S-IVB 
impact and readings from some of the other seismic 
sites. Any questions on that? I realize that this 
is pretty ragged. Over. 


Oh, that's -that's great, Gordy. Did Kovach in


dicate his tentative depth for the second high-
velocity layer? 


No. As far as the information we have here, he's 
just -I -I don't see any -the only thing I can 
see is he mentions we're getting a depth sample 
down to 3 to 4 kilometers, but that was before all 
the charges had gone off. So I think, as I say, 
he just doesn't really state that yet. 


Yes, it's a little early. Okay, good. Sounds 
like what we saw in the field to a certain extent. 


Okay. On the heat flow, it's continuing to work 
perfectly. It's stabilizing out and, at the 
present time, they show about a degree centigrade 
per meter gradient. Apollo 15 is stabilized at 


about 1.8, and it looks like the 17 site's headed 


for about the same, which gives consistent data 


for the two sites. It looks like that's what is 


going to result when it reaches final equilibrium. 
And so that -if you call that -those two sites 
typical of the Moon, then that leads one to the 


following conclusions; that that data requires 
that there be a total greater abundance of radioactive 
isotopes on the Moon as compared to the 
Earth, so there would be an implication here for 
a fundamental difference in the composition between 
the two. And the higher number of isotopes 
would in turn require that they be located very 
near the surface, implying substantial differentiation 
of the material, at least compositionally or 
stratisfaetionally [sic]. It's not necessary that 
it had have to be stratified. It was only required 
that it be stratified in most of -in that 
most of the isotopes be concentrated in the upper 
layers of the Moon. I guess that's about what 
we've got on the heat flow at the present time. 
Over.

perature lay -zone is now at the site?

LMP I think you mentioned 
about -I thought you

something the other night -

CC Let me just read it straight off here. There is 
some words to that effect, but it doesn't sound 
like 2-1/2 meters. At a large scale -let's see, 
he's describing a viewgraph here -the surface 
temperature at the time of this sample was 360 degrees 
Kelvin. At a depth of about 15 centimeters, 
it had dropped to 280. At about 65 centimeters, 
the temperature drops to 254, and that's the lowest 
temperature we see. Below that depth, the temperature 
begins to increase again, and it's 257 at 
the bottom of the probes. Over. 
LMP Where was the 254 again? 
CC At 65 centimeters below the surface. 
LMP Okay. That's about the same, I think, as 15. 
Very good. Some of our double cores will get that 
deep.

amount 
Okay, the TGE has produced some -fair 
of excitement around here -and interest. 
The instrument really worked beautifully. It had 
some baro switches that turned it on for temperature 
control -right aft -during lift-off -and 
so it had 3 days to stabilize before you got to 
Taurus-Littrow. And on landing, the bias measurement 
showed that the bias shift was extremely small, 
so they feel that they had a very accurate reading 
on all the readings. And I mentioned the other 
night that the number they got for the gravity 
field at the landing site should allow them to 
actually revise the value for the radius of the 
Moon at the landing site. But then you asked me 
about some of the variations in reading around the 
valley there. Well, it turns out that -if you 
call the landing site zero on the scale of milligals 
and then take the differences from the landing 


Tape 176/6 


site, over to the South Massif, you have a 
minus 36; in other words, a lesser amount of 
gravity. And all these numbers, by the way, are 
corrected only for elevation, and there are some 
more sophisticated corrections to -to be put on 


them. But the -with -correcting for elevation, 


you have a 36-milligal negative anomaly at the 


South Massif. And the number at the North Massif 
was a minus 26. And there is very little difference, 
within a milligal or so, between the 


North Massif and the Sculptured Hills site. But 


you can see that there's a significant difference 
between the landing site and the foothills on 
both sides. The Shorty Crater showed a slight 
positive anomaly compared to the landing site, 


but it's less than a milligal, which is sort of 


you start to think "Well, that means a localized 
volcanic center," but it's -nobody's really 


going out that far on a limb. The -they were 


especially appreciative of the 2A stop, which 
was -let's see -well, it verified the extremely 


sharp gradient of the anomalous condition from 
the foothills as you go back into the valley. 
The 2A stop -I'm trying to find the number here Okay, 
one's a minus 36 at station 2 to a minus 29 
at 2A, so it's -it really changes quickly as you 
get away from the -the mountains. Okay, he 
summar -summarized his feelings by saying that the 
negative gravity anomalies which were measured 
right at the South Massif and the North Massif 


clearly indicate that the valley is filled with a 


higher density of material than the material which 


makes up the massif so that if the material under


lying the floor at Taurus-Littrow -say, is basaltic 


in composition and has a density of about 3, the 


material which makes up the massif has a substan


tially lower density. He goes on to say that 


we're not sure exactly what the density difference 


is, but if it's as large as 20 percent difference, 


then the material in the floor of the valley and 


the -well, the thickness of the high-density 


material in the valley has to be on the order of 


about l-l/2 kilometers thick. So that's a -I 


guess that's a minimum thickness, assuming the 


greatest difference in densities.

That's very interesting, Gordy. 


Yes. They're really -everything is really tied 
in the original theories on the structure and 
makeup of the valley. Everything seems to be falling 
right in there, and that's what has -has the 
whole crowd of scientists around here really 
smiling. Let's see -let me find out what's next 
here. Okay. It was Strangway's turn next, and 
he didn't have any results to present, of course, 
because he's got to get the tape back first, really. 
However, the orbital sounder -the command module 
sounder -when they made the pass across the site 
with the transmitter on -No, I got it backwards. 
When it was in a listening mode, listening to the 
ground transmitter's signals, they found that the 
signal was in exactly the frequency range that it 
was supposed to be, and they -they picked up the exactly 
the right sequence rate, once every 0.8 second. 
And when they calculated the power levels, 
that we were putting out just exactly the 1 watt 
that we were expected to put out. So that -that 
everything looks good as far as the operation of 
the transmitter, and without going into all the 
details which you know as well as I do about the 
thermal problems on the receiver, they're still well, 
he sums it up, we have no reason yet to be 
sweating it too badly. They're very hopeful that 
when the tape gets back, we'll have good data on 


at least some of the legs, and they're -they're 
waiting for you to bring it to them. Dick Kruse 


is here, and he mentioned that all your pains, 
Geno, in brushing dust off of it probably saved 
the day. If it's there, it was just due to that, 
that it did work, because it was really on the 


ragged edge here. 


About what's left, I think -is the field geology 


interpretation. And what I've got and can get 


tonight because there's no one really around here 


from the geology team at this time -it's about 


11 o'clock at night -is so rambling that I'm not 


going to bother to read it to you. But I will 


leave a request so that when Parker get you up in 


the morning, maybe he can summarize that or answer 


any questions in that area that you might have.

three things before you went to bed. For one 
thing, we don't see the cabin pumped up yet with 
the 0PS as per Plan and we don't have the onboard 
read-outs yet, and we'd like to find out who's 


going to be on the comm and talk to Ron about his 
headset. I guess the general concensus of opinion 


down here, unless we know more about the fix, is 
there are some possible serious consequences, like 


blowing up the audio panel, if those wires did 


get together and short out, depending on which 
wires they are. So there's some concern about that. 


Okay, let's get you the read-out first, and we're 
going to bounce up the cabin here very shortly 
with the OPS.

· On the comm carrier, there's a whole bunch of 
wires, about eight of them-looks like they're 
twisted pairs, you, know, twisted in fours really. 
They come up through the thing. And two of those 
· eight wires are cut -are broken in two. The hot 
end, or the end that comes up from the plug going 
toward the headset -those two wires both come out 
individually and individually taped, each one of 
them. And then the whole group -you know, I 
bent them out of the way so they wouldn't be touching 
anything. So they wouldn't touch insulation 
or tape. I bent them out of the way and taped 
the whole side of it just to keep the rest of them 
from breaking in two, and it looks like a pretty 
good fix on the thing, really. However, if you 
_ have any concern about blowing the audio panel -
I'll just go ahead and wear the lightweight headset. 
¥ 1i 01 25 22 CC Okay, Ron. Yes, the concern here is not only which 
wires they are -the potential does exist if one 
of those shorts to ground to blow the audio panel 
or at least a circuit breaker, depending upon 
which wire it is. I gather that what you've 
done -is that you haven't wired the broken wires 
back together, but it's just sort of covered the 
bare leads and wired them out of the way. Is 
that right?

60 degrees. 


Okay. 


Bob, EECOM's procedure's almost like having a fire 
in the fireplace. 


Roger. Glad you're comfortable. 


America, Houston. 


Go ahead, Bob. 


How would you like a quick look at sports here 
and then into the news summary while you're having 
your breakfast? 


We'd like the whole thing. 


Well, I guess that we all assume maybe you're like 
the rest of us and turn to your sport page first 
sometimes. So we thought we'd recap the pro football 
action yesterday, in a rather strange day, 
since there were only -only two games that really 
made any difference. And I think the scores kind 


of showed the day. In the American Conference 
playoff games coming up next weekend, Oakland will 
play at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh getting into the 
playoffs for the first time in 40 years. The 


Cleveland Browns will take on the undefeated Miam_ 


Dolphins, who have won 14 straight. In the National 
Conference, Dallas will be at San Francisco Saturday, 
and Green Bay plays at Washington on Sunday. 
Quickly recapping some of the scores from yesterday. 
On that sad, sad one here in Houston, Cincinnati 
rolled over the Oilers, 61 to 17. There were three 
touchdowns scored in the fourth quarter within less 
than 5 minutes of play, all on interceptions -on 
the part of Cincinnati. New York Giants, it says, 
upset Dallas 23 to 3. I question the upset since 
Dallas was already in the playoffs; and, in what 
I watched, it looked like they were aware that they 
were already in the playoffs. Buffalo upset Washington 
24 to I7. And again it's a questionable 
upset because O. J. Simpson had a great day, and 
Larry Brown from Washington was kept on the bench 



Tape 182/6 


for the whole game. Oakland, 28, over Chicago, 21; 
Detroit, 34, over Los Angeles, 17. Los Angeles' 


hopes for any playoff berth had been knocked out 
by San Francisco's win on Saturday, and it looked 
like they played that way on Sunday. Cleveland, 
in a real tough one up in New York with BO-knot 
winds and a -gale -gale-force winds and lots of 
snow and cold, defeated New York Jets, 26 to 10. 
Green Bay, 30, over New Orleans, 20, in a tough 
one, which saw two -two touchdowns being scored 
off of blocked punts. Kansas City, 17, over Atlanta, 


14. And, again, Atlanta's chances for a playoff 
berth had been wiped out on Saturday; and, apparently, 
they played that way on Sunday. Denver, 45, 
over New England, 21; St. Louis, 24, over Philadelphia, 
23.

11 09 20 31 CC Pittsburgh defeated San Diego, 24 to 2. On Saturday, 
Miami had taken Baltimore, 16 to 0, and, as I 
previously mentioned, San Francisco defeated Minnesota 
on Saturday, 20 to 17. Just one little 
note, Jack, you might be interested in this morning's 
paper, concerning the New Orleans Saints. 
Dave Parks from the New Orleans Saints has announced 
his retirement, and he kind of took a rap at the 
Saints in claiming that they were a team that did 
not want to win, and that he was retiring unless 
they would trade him to a winner. It sound like 
our friend over there might have some problems 
this winter come contract time. In pro basketball 
last night, the Houston Rockets beat the Cleveland 
Cavaliers, 110 to 109. Jack Marin had 35 points, 
Mike Newlin had 34. In college basketball, UCLA 
remains number 1 in the latest ratings. Second-
ranked Florida State was beaten this weekend by 
Princeton, 61 to 59. Third-ranked Maryland won, 
as did fourth-ranked Marquette, fifth-ranked Minnesota, 
and number 6, North Carolina State. Indiana 
is rated 15th, Houston is 16th. We can't find 
Purdue, Kansas, or Cal Tech in the ratings right 
now. There's one bowl game tonight. Iowa State, 
who has taken a five-game losing streak into the 
Liberty Bowl, will meet Georgia Tech at Memphis, 
Tennessee. In local hockey, the Aeros and the 
Los Angeles Sharks of the World Hockey Association 
battled to a 4 to 4 tie. 
11 09 21 59 CC Now, for page 1 news. The outlook for a quick 
peace settlement in Vietnam has taken an apparent 
turn for the worse. The Hanoi government radio 
announced last night that U.S. planes have dropped 
more mines in Haiphong harbor and has also carried 
out bombing and rocket attacks on the city of 
Haiphong. There was no immediate comment from 
Washington on the charges. The snag in the Paris 
peace talks apparently hinges on a few key points, 
according to press association reports. Among 
them, the North Vietnamese will not accept the idea 
of two separate Vietnamese states and the method 
of policing a truce, the two-Vietnam policy being 
the major stumbling block. The weather here is

Airport was a frigid 22 degrees. Downtown Houston 
was 32. The airport reading was the lowest since 
1932. Up north in the upper Midwest and northeast, 
it's going to be a white Christmas, and more snow 
is moving into the area. Chicago had a low of 
5 above Sunday; Kansas City, 19; and Albuquerque, 


18. Anne Armstrong, long a power in Texas Republican 
politics, is reportedly about to be named to a 
high post in the Nixon administration. Harry Truman 
still clings to life. The 88-year-old Presi 88-
year-old former President is holding his own, 
according to his doctors. Debris found floating 
in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida 
has been identified as that of a Coast Guard Helicopter 
that crashed. Earlier the chopper had rescued 
four fishermen from a sinking shrimp trawler. 
The helicopter was headed back to Saint -Saint 
Petersburg when it went down with the four fisher


men and the crew of four. It's a lot safer up 
there where you are than on the Texas highways. 
The State Highway Patrol reported a high number of 
serious accidents on Texas roads this weekend. A 

Houston newspaper reports that industrial demand 


for Trinity River system water will not produce 
enough money to finance the project and that the 


City of Houston's water and industrial district 


funds will have to make up the difference. Mean


while, the Clear Lake City Water Authority is 


tossing around a proposal that would require de


velopers to pay 50 percent of the cost of all lat


eral water and sewer lines. Up around Conroe, in 
Montgomery County, a transformer blew up Sunday 
morning and electrical power went out for several 


hours. Several thousand homes were affected. Bay-


town was the scene of four armed robberies Sunday. 


Four business establishments were hit in a 14-minute 
period. The masked gunmen got about $500 cash. 
No one was injured. And a final note, today in 
history, actress Betty Grable is 56 years old.

CC We've identified a humber of cracks and crevices 
up in the -in the area -any area above the couch 
plane along the X-axis or just above the couch 
plane that could possibly be places where the 
scissors disappeared to. And we would like those 
areas searched if they haven't been searched 
already. As an example, the crack between the top 
of the main display panel number 2 and the -the 
hatch opening area, that kind of crack and crevice 
area there. We would like that looked into. I 
kind of assume you've already done that. We don't 
want you to remove any panels or anything like that 
to look in. But have you looked in those areas, or 
do you plan to look in those areas here shortly? 
CMP Hey, Bob, I've looked in some of those things. 
But just to make sure I've covered everything and 
the fact that we checked it again, why don't we go 
over it again. 
CC Okay. 
CMP Wait a minute and I'll get my flashlight, and then 
we can start doing it again systematically. 
CC Okay. 
LMP It's scissors, my dear Watson, scissors. 
CC Seriously, it would have saved a lot of problem if 
you'd seen them floating out, Jack. We would have 
just not had to have done any of this. 
CDR Houston, America. 
CC Roger. Go ahead. 
CDR Bob, it looks like we're going to make it on this 
0PS depress. She's reading 0, and she's just 
barely bleeding out. We're somewhere around 5.5, 
so I'm just going to let it bleed out now. And 
then we'll stow it.

we checked that. And also checked it again 
CC Okay. From our pictures, and this may not really 
be the case, on the -above main display panel 3, 
where it says -where the handhold, the structure 
part of handhold, looks like there's some cracks 
and crevices right above -right around that hand-
hold area that could, between the handhold and 
panel 6, that a pair of scissors could slip up into. 
CMP Okay. We're looking around there, and it doesn't 
look like they could -Well, they could possibly 
fit in there maybe. But, anyhow, we checked it, 
and they're not there. 
CC Okay. And then on the other side of the cockpit 
in the same area around handhold, back behind the -
that crevice area back behind the COAS power panel, 
panel 15, and the handhold. And then also that 
little area in front of the handhold, where -the 
cutout for main display panel 2, you might look -
take your light and look in there. 
11 11 49 06 CMP Okay. I'm over there now. 
11 11 50 51 CMP Okay, Houston. No joy on that part either. 
CC Okay, Ron. The next couple are really down in the 
lower equipment hay area, and then I've got one 
area up in the tunnel -two areas up in the tunnel 
that are suspect areas, and then that does it. 
Which would you like first? 


Tape 184/4 
CMP I'm up in the tunnel, now. 
CC Okay; the tunnel area. The only thing we show up 
there is the -the lo,mrhandholds around the -
around the tunnel. I don't think scissors could 
get up there, but there -they -maybe they could 
slip in something like that. Anyway, those four 
handhold slots up there, you might check in those 
two areas. 
CMP Those scissors couldn't fit in those handholds, 
but it's good to check them. Something else might 
be in there. 
CC Okay. The -Oh, in the other one up in that area, 
Ron, and I assume you -you've put that outlet bag 
over the cabin fans -and we wouldn't want you to 
fool with that at all, because it's probably all 
full of dirt and everything -but if you didn't, 
then the outlet to the cabin fan area might be 
a potential place. 
CMP Let's see. We installed that the first day out, 
I think. And it's been on there ever since. 
CC Yes, we assumed you did. I just was trying to 
cover all bases here. Okay; the last three items -
I think you've actually called one of them -are 
down in the lower equipment bay. One of them is 
the -the crack just below panel 101, down in the 
lower equipment bay. I think, you called that one 
the first night, didn't you? 
CMP Not below 101; no. 
CC Okay. Our pictures show a crevice below 101, and 
also while you're right there, I -I don't think 
it's even -there's a crevice above the door for 
the optics stowage area that you might check up in 
there. It might have lodged. And, also, while 
you're right there, Ron, our picture, of course, 
shows your hoses stowed, and they kind of come out 
right there to the right of panel 120, the optics 
stowage area. And so you've got some area behind 
those panels -behind those hoses and that -where 
it might have lodged, but I believe you had to move 
those in order to do your EVA yesterday, anyway.

Yes, the hoses in the tunnel have all been moved 


around in here, as far as the hoses are concerned. 


I still think 
the biggest probability is -is right 


above the optics stowage, and that's what I was 


talking about 
before. Because it's about -oh, an 


inch. You know, the crack is at least an inch deep 


in there and 
as long as the optics stowage thing 


itself. 


Okay; and let me -We'll have one more recommen


dation for you. 


Okay. 


And then over panel 250 there's a little bitty 
opening -It shows in the pictures -over panel 250. 


Okay; we'll check that in a second here. 


Our only thoughts, non, on the -any other position 


that you might see -You know, if it's above the 


couch plane and you really think it might be a 


suspect area, you might consider taping the crack, 


if you desire. The tape probably isn't going to 


hold it in if it wants to come tumbling out, but 


it -it's something you could do if you wanted to. 


Okay. Yes, 
I understand that, Bob. That's a good 


point. 


And, non, while we're talking to you, we'd llke to 


tag up with you on one more item unrelated to the 
scissors search, and that is your headset situation. 
And we just want to leave the -make sure you're 
going to do as was said last night and will not 
plug that -the headset with the broken wire, you 
will not plug in again, and we'll arrange your 
entry configuration in some configuration that 
does not require that headset to be plugged in. 


Is that affirm? 


Yes, that's 
affirm, Bob. I think what I'll do, 


I'll wear it as a bump hat, you know, and then and 
then use the lightweight headset with the you 
know, with the earplugs underneath that. I'll 


put the lightweight headset around my neck, and

Okay, Bob. We got the major compartments inven


toried and stowed, frankly, with the exception of 
the things we need, of course, between now and 
then in the sleeping areas and what have you. 
We'll finish that off, of course, as we finish up 
with gear and as we get up in the morning. But 
there's very little left to do, and any contingency 
weight changes, which there may be just a couple 
at the most, we'll inventory those and give them

I got it. 


Okay. We're starting. 


Houston, this is Ron. While we're getting dark 


adapted here, probably won't see any for a while. 


Let me Just record on the tape my impression of 


these light flashes as they occurred around the 


Moon and at other times. In general, they've all 
been essentially -just a -as -as it says -a 
flash, with a -with a little bit of a glow, and 
usually in one eye or the other eye. And for 
some reason, most generally, they've been kind of if 
you -you don't want to say it's in -it's in 
the periphery of your vision, because you get 
the feeling that maybe there was a flash over to 
the left or down to the right or something like 
that. But you don't get a distinct impression as 
to where the flash came from. Well, you can you 
can see where it came from, but not -you 
can't see the flash itself. Like it was just 
beyond your vision. Most of them have been like 
that. At one time and one time only throughout 
the flight, I can remember kind of a triple flash, 
so to speak. And in that case, there was a bright 


flash in the left eye on -on -about l0 o'clock 
in the left eye. And then it repeated itself 
again about 2 o'clock in the left eye. And then 
about, oh, l0 o'clock, a quarter of the way out, 
in the right eye. I just got a bing, bing, bing, 
just like that. Three -three of them right in a 
row. And the rest of the time, though, they've 


all essentially been single flashes to me. 


This is Gene here. I'll just remark that both 


Jack and I did see them on the lunar surface. 
guess the best summation I can make of that is I 
think I saw both lines and -and the spots or the 
flashes a little bit more sharply, but that might 
be because of the adaptation -dark adaptation

Tape 188/2 
CC Roger, Apollo 17. If you're ready for the 
questioning, I'll begin. 
LMP Go ahead, Gordo. 
CC Okay. As usual in these inflight news 
conferences, the questions that will be asked 
of you were prepared by correspondents covering 
the Apollo 17 mission at the Manned Spacecraft 
Center in Houston. They will be read exactly as 
written and in the order determined by the 
newsmen. The first question is for Jack Schmitt. 
If you, as a geologist, were coming home from a 
field trip on Earth, you'd be drafting a 
preliminary report and discussing it with fellow 
geologists. In terms understandable to laymen, 
can you sm_mmarize what you would be saying in 
your preliminary report about your field trip 
to Taurus-Littrow? 
LMP Well, I'll -I'll give that a try, Gordy. I 
think the thing we had hoped to accomplish at 
Taurus-Littrow was to look at a -as broad a 
spectrum of the history of the Moon as possible 
in one small area, as the concluding flight to 
the Apollo Program. And I think we did that. I 
think we had look -did look at some of the 
oldest rocks that it is possible to see with our 
capability in the breccias of the South and North 
Massifs. I think we saw some intermediate-age 
rocks of fairly unexpected character, I believe, 
in the subfloor crystalline or igneous rocks, the 
gabbro, as we called them there. And we also 
understood, I think, that those rocks, in fact, 
had intruded into the breccias of the North 
Massif. We found, I believe, in the -at the 
Crater Van Serg, on the third EVA, that the 
regolith, or the garden zone, on the top of that 
subfloor gabbro, or the igneous rocks, was quite 
thick, or appears to be very thick, which is an 
expected result, and will -hopefully, those 
rocks will have much information about a fairly 
extended period of lunar erosion. And, we found 
that there was indeed a dark mantle over the area 


Tape 188/3 
of -variable thickness; but, apparently, of 
relatively recent age, and that in turn had a 
light mantle of material of which we do not yet 
understand, and I think that the samples are 
going to have to tell that story. It may well be 
a land slide that has come off the South Massif. 
And, then, possibly as important as any finding, 
we found that even later than that relatively 
young light mantle deposit are avalanche -possible 
avalanche -we have alteration reminiscent of the 
alteration by hot waters or hot gases on Earth, 
and that was the orange -appears to be the orange 
soil that we found around the Crater Shorty. And, 
subsequently, in orbit we started to pick up, and 
particularly through Ron Evans' efforts, pick up 
more of the apparent evidence of such alteration 
taking place in fairly recent time on the Moon. 
All of those items, I think, are extremely 
significant and go through the full range of our 
present knowledge of lunar history. And, a report 
I would write would initially summarize that 
particular sequence of events. 
CC Question number 2 is for Jack, again. What 
other probable explanations besides volcanic 
origin do you have for the orange rock and 
colored soil that you found at Shorty Crater? 
11 17 33 02 LMP Well, they don't necessarily have to be volcanic, 
Gordy. I refer to them as alteration, and much 
of the hydrothermal, or hot water, alteration we 
see on Earth is related to recent volcanism, or 
ancient volcanism; but, also, we know of that 
kind of alteration of preexisting materials to 
take place as a result of -of just fluids working 
their way up through the Earth's crust, and I 
presume that such a process is also possible on 
the Moon. The ones we saw seem to be associated 
with areas of dark mantle of various types, and 
t most of the photographic evidence we have is that 
those dark mantle deposits are associated with 
volcanism, but it is not necessarily proved yet, 
I believe, that the -the orange soils or the 
alterations we've seen are volcanic. However, the 


Tape188/4 


process would be a related 
of internal origin. 
process, that is, one 
CC The third question is for Cernan or Schmitt. 
Your voices are so much alike that it is unclear 
to some of us which one of you found the orange 
rock and who first spotted the layer of orange 
soil on the crater rim. 
ll 17 34 22 CDR Jack found it. He uncovered it as he was walking 
on the rim, and we worked with that, and then, as 
I went around the crater to take the stereo base 
pan from within the crater, I could see alterations 
radially down from the rim farther beyond where 
we were working down to the center. 
LMP I don't think that that question of who found it 
is as specifically as important as that that we 
were there with the equipment and the training 
jointly to not only recognize that but to take 
advantage of having recognized it, and I hope 
that we did. 
$ 
CC Okay. The next one's for Ron Evans. Why do you 
think you were able to see so much orange 
material from lunar orbit, after your partners 
had found some on the ground, where none of the 
previous Apollo crews reported seeing anything 
but grays, tans, and browns? 
ll 17 35 22 CMP Well, I think, for one thing, that we were in, 
essentially, a different orbit than some of the 
other crews that had been up there before. And 
even though each of us has a color tone in our 
own eyes, what we come up with, I think, is a 
function pretty much of what you'd like to 
believe and what you'd like to see out of things. 
If you feel it has a tint of orange with it, and 
this is in a new area that we really haven't 
flown over that much, and this is primarily -
where we were seeing this type of thing was on 
the western rim of Serenitatis, and some of the -
well, at least it looks like known volcanic 
deposits along the rim of Serenitatis.

Gordy, let me add quickly that there's no such 
thing as a truly objective observer; and, I be


lieve, that once you start looking for something, 
and when Ron heard about what we were doing, I'm 
sure he started looking, himself, to see what we 
had seen. That leads you to see things. Now that's 
not seeing things that are not there. It makes you 
look for things that are there, and that's extremely 
inportant; and that's where the kind of training all 
three of us have had and I think has made it possible 
for us to find a lot of things that might not 
otherwise have been found. 


Here's one addressed to all three crewmen. What 


will you remember most about this mission? 


Boy, that's a loaded question, Gordy. There's so 


many things, but I think probably the thing that when 
I think about it -that will stick with me 
most is the same thing that stuck with me -for 
my last two missions -not so much being there, 
but it's getting the chance to get home and share 
what you've seen and what you've done with other 
people. 


I think in my case, the lift-off itself was something 
brand new for me. It's something beyond The 
booster ride itself was something beyond what 
I could really comprehend. So, I think that's oh, 
it's a very important part of it. I will always 
remember that part of it. But I'm kind of like 
with Gene; I feel that even though the three of us 
have been up here and had the opportunity to observe 
the Moon, look at what we could find and that type 
of thing, I think that we have an obligation to 
share our experiences with the rest of the people. 


Well, Gordy, that is a difficult question. It has 
been a fascinating experience from so many detail 
aspects. I guess, generally speaking, the thing 
I carry back with me, I hope, is an increased perspective 
not only for the history of the solar 


system, but I hope for the future of mankind within 
that solar system. 



Tape 188/6 
CDR Gordy, this doesn't mean that that last 50,000 feet 
won't stick in my mind for a long time. 
CC Roger, Gene. Again for all three crewmen. Now 
that you are returning home from what may be the 
last lunar exploration of this century, what short-
range and long-range plans do each of you have for 
the future? 
CDR Well, my short-range plans are certainly to enjoy 
Christmas with my family, think about the flight, 
get its data down on paper. My long-range plans 
are to turn around and look at the next flight 
whenever that may be and put my efforts and experience 
toward that flight and get to work on it. 
CMP I think my short-range plans -of course, first of 
all tomorrow I want to make a real good reentry, 
and that's kind of the real short-range part of it. 
From that point on, as I mentioned before, I think 
we have a responsibility, at least, I feel we have 
responsibilities to share our experiences with the 
rest of the people not only in the United States, 
but with the people of the rest of the world. Beyond 
that, I also have a strong desire to continue 
participating in manned space flight in whatever 
capacity that I might be able to. 
LMP Well, I can do nothing but echo Gene and Ron's 
words and maybe add, Gordy, that I hope that through 
the next few years I'll be able to make some contributions 
that guarantee that this Apolly 17 flight 
is not the last exploration program in this century 
in space. 
CC Again, for all the crew. Throughout the mission 
there were periodic reports from each of you about 
gastric distress in one form or another. Does this 
trouble make you think that the three Skylab missions 
of 28, 56, and 56 days scheduled for next 
year are too ambitious? 
CDR No, not at all. I don't think they are too ambitious, 
Gordy. I think that's the reason we're flying each 
and every one of these flights one at a time. To 
find out if there really are potential problems in 


Tape 188/7 


diet or what have you, and I think we solved a lot 


of them from Apollo 15 and 16, and those few that 


we had I'm sure we can solve, accordingly, prior 
to Skylab flying. 


CMP 
I don't think I can add anything to that. 


LMP 
I think we've made a big improvement over the problems 
that occurred on Apollo 16, and I think as a 
result of our observations in conjunction with the 
medical people, primarily at NASA, that solution 


a very clear solution will be found for Skylab and 


any other mission we want to fly. 


CC 
Okay. For Ron Evans. You seemed almost euphoric 
during your space walk yesterday, and other space 
walkers before you seemed to have had this same 
reaction to the experience. Can you describe what 
it was like and how it made you feel? 


CMP 
Well, I think for those of you who had the opportunity 
to watch yesterday, it is pretty obvious how 
I felt out there. I'm not sure euphoric is the 
word. I -it's an opportunity -Well, to me I guess 
it was an opportumity to be what I call a "real 


space man." And -you're out there in the deepness 


of space, with nothing there but your spacesuit on, 


and you're doing the job that has to be done. And 


we're riding around in space out here, and this is 


in a capsule and we look out the window, you know, 


but it's nice firm feeling. It's a solidly built 


vehicle, 
and you get the zero g effect on the thing, 


but you don't get the feeling of -really getting 


out and walking in space. And once I became ac


customed 
to what it was like in the EVA environ


ment, then you relax and you take it easy, you try 
to accomplish what you can and observe what you 
can and really enjoy it. And I think I really 
enjoyed it. 


LMP 
I had a hold of his umbilical most of that time 


and I didn't notice that he was ready to jump out 
into space if that's the kind of euphoria you're 
talking about.

Okay. For Eugene Cernan and any other later comments. 
You talked a lot about this mission being 
the end of the beginning, but a lot of people don't 
agree. Recognizing the United States is stopping 
lunar exporation for the forseeable future, how 


do you feel? 


When we look back at the Apollo Program I don't 
think anyone can privately to themselves and publicly 
say that this isn't truly indeed really a 
beginning -a beginning of man's really first venture 
out into deep space. And once there's a be


ginning, there's a continuation. The probing into 


deep space by man, the next landing on the Moon, a 
trip to Mars may not be for 10 years, a decade; it 
may not be until the end of this century. But I 
personally have faith that it will happen. I think 


it's a restraint, an abnormal restraint of man's 
intellect at this point in time to restrict or tend 
to think that he will restrict his own feeling of 


exploration, his own quest for knowledge. He's had 
ailopportunity. He's proved that he could take 
advantage of this opportunity, and I think that the 

nature of mankind isgoing to just press on. That's 
why I believe not -we of Apollo 17 -yes, it's a 
beginning; but the whole Apollo Program is really 
the true beginning of what's to come in the future. 
And I firmly believe that. We can look back in a 
100 years or 200 years and the 5-year or 10-year 
period of time, we may be slowed down here. I 


think we'll be -we'll be lost in the merit of what 
is really accomplished during the next several 


decades. 


The next question is for all the crew. The American 
people seem to be getting fairly blase about space 
flight and television coverage of Apollo 17 has been 


at a minimum. But this is not the case abroad. For 
example, in the Republic of Zaire, the former 
Belgian Congo_ an estimated 20 million people are 
watching extensive coverage on TV sets set up in 
the villages. What do you have to say to the people 
of underdeveloped nations? 



Tape 188/9 
Well, Gordy, first of all, I'm not sure that the 
amount of television coverage is necessarily a 
measure of the interest of the American people. I 
don't have those figures at hand. I'm sorry to 
hear that the adventures we had and the insight 
that maybe we gained into not only ourselves, but 
to the history of the solar system was not shared 
extensively with the _erican people, if that's 
true. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, 
and also the people of the United States who may 
not participate as much in the affluence that we 
all would like to share, I think that's what space 
flight in general and the Apollo Program in particular 
has offered, is many new avenues from which we 
can provide for those people abroad and for our own 
people, the kind of Quality of life and the material 
-including the material quality of life that 
everybody aspires to. I think we've just begun the 
adventure of understanding how -what we've learned 
and how we've learned to do it in space can be applied 
to these particular kinds of problems. That 
is one of the great challenges that I think NASA 
and other agencies within the United States Government 
and other governments abroad have, is to use 
this base of technological information now for 
their own people. 
11 17 47 26 CDR I'd like to just add to that very briefly, Gordy, 
that America has led the way into space in the past. 
I believe we will in the future. But, a point I 
tried to get across several days earlier in this 
flight is that the real promise of the future for 
all the peoples of the Earth is to weld themselves 
into a coherent group of people who can live and 
work together and then enjoy all the benefits and 
all the knowledge that is to come from future space 
explorations. I think we are doing this not just 
as Americans but as human beings and everyone 
throughout these countries throughout the world 
f who are watching us right now are also human beings 
no different than we are. It's their accomplishment 
as well as it is ours. 
CC Question 11 is for Jack. Do you think the United 
States waited too long to send a geologist to the 
Moon?

We're grinning because I think we predicted that 
question. Gordy, I think the United States waited 
too long to go into space in the first place, and 
I think they're probably going to wait too long to 
go back. I will always feel that way no matter who 
goes or what qualifications he may have or may think 
he has. I think that the most important thing that 
maybe I have done is to -to be able to show that 
we can build a transportation system that allows 
you to fly people of a wide variety of disciplines. 
And I think that we have shown that, and I think 
that it's occurred at about as soon as possible 
within the Apollo Program. 


The last couple of questions are in a lighter vein 
for Ron Evans. There has been a lot of discussion 


about missing a pair of scissors in the command 
module. Who really lost the scissors? 


Well, I think it must have been one of those other 
guys because I was asleep and I got up the next 
morning and it was gone. 


Didn't happen on my watch. 


And also, Ron, did you squeaking of those mice on 
board keep you awake? 


No, the mice really didn't -there are plenty of 
other things going on inside the spacecraft here 
that we can hardly even hear the mice. As a matter 
of fact I really haven't heard them yet. 


Okay. This completes the list of questions submitted 
by the newsmen here in Houston. There are 
a little less than 7 minutes left on our scheduled 
time for any other further remarks you might like 
to make. 


Yes, Gordy, I think we'd like to take this opportunity 
to each say a word or two. 


Well, just briefly, Gordy, I feel that I have done 
something that's very significant here in my life. 
I hope that -and will do eyerything I can to see 
that it is not the most significant thing I ever 
do. But, I feel that the fact that I had the

opportunity to do in a large part to the tangible 
and intangible effects that my mother and father 
had on my life and to them I send my thanks and I 
hope that I continue to live up to their expectations. 


Youknow on Apollo 17, here, we've had two outstanding 
vehicles and that's the -don't let me get you 
wrong, I'm not discounting the booster either. But, 
I've watched a lot of people work on a lot of spacecraft, 
and I'm very proud to be able to say that 


all the vehicles that have been associated with 
Apollo 17 have been outstanding. And, the reason 
they are outstanding is because of the people that 

have been working on them. And, I'd like to give 
our thanks and the well-done to people who worked 
on our spacecraft. 


Gordy, prior to leaving and I guess I can certainly 
assume during the flight we've carried many, many 
well wishes and carried many prayers aboard from 
people throughout the world. I personally believe 


that those prayers played no small part in any success 
that we were able to achieve on this flight. 


I ask those people, however, to continue their 
prayers in particular for some of our friends and 
some of our comrades who are still in southeast 


Asia -POWs, MIAs who may not -although God willing 
I hope they will -but who may not have the opportunities 
to get home and enjoy the Christmas that 
we're looking forward to. And with that from 
Apollo 17 spacecraft America on December 18, 1972, 
we all wish you a very, very Merry Christmas and a 
happy holiday season. Godspeed and God bless you

wears his molded earpiece in, then rotate the 


lightweight headset mike boom 90 degrees. They 


found that was necessary to get it to face your 
mouth when -when you end up with this all taped 
on there. You have to sort of twist it, force it 


90 degrees. Then lay the lightweight headset boom 
along the comm carrier boom with the electronic 
part on the outside of your -your earpiece on the 
Snoopy hat. And the -the hose that goes to the 
molded earpiece facing downward coming out down and 
with the -the mike boom i inch beyond the comm 
carrier mike boom tip. And then tape the two booms 
together for the entire length of the co-w, carrier 


boom. And then rebend the whole works back so that 


the tip is back in front of your mouth. And then 


tape the electronics box onto the side of the ear


piece, and you can run tape all the way around the 


lower part of the earpiece, and you can lift up on 


the leather-covered doughnuts on the inside there, 


pull that loose and then run tape underneath. Just 


pull the lower part of it loose, run tape all the

you just route the -the electrical lead and the

put -put all the excess length of the connectors

they did try in this configuration is -was -was 


to see if you could get the helmet on over all that,

notice, and it does go on. Randy Hester tried it. 


And with just a little cocking of the head, you can 


get the helmet on over. How's that sound to you? 


Hey, Gordy. That sounds essentially what we were 
thinking about. We hadn't got to the extent of 
trying to hook them up yet, you know, put them 
together yet, but we're thinking along the same 
lines anyhow. And you brought up a couple of points 
that are good. 


Okay. If you got any questions or anything, I've 


got a demo model sitting right in front of me here, 


so that we can just discuss it real time as you get 


it set up. I assume you're going to try to work 


that up tonight. Is that right? 


Yes, we can, I guess. Okay, and the -the reason 


you'd rather have Jack do it than me is simply 


simply because of the redun -redund -I can't say 


the word. (Laughter) Redundancy. 


That's affirmative. It gives you and Gene the 


the prime -best equipment, and we see no -no 


reason why this won't work, but like you say, it's 


only one mike in place of two on the other ones. 


I'm surprised you didn't have us tape two headsets 


to the Snoopy helmet. 


Well, Jack_ we'll just take that chance. 


Well, it took 14 days, but I finally know where

Okay, Gordo. We're there now. 


Hey, Houston; America. We can take those words on 


the weather in the recovery area, if you like. 


Okay. It can be summed up by one word, "Excellent." 
2000, scattered, and high-scattered are forecast. 
I'm looking at a satellite picture -high-resolution 
satellite picture that shows you in the middle of a 
big high, and she's just -very faint hint of clouds 


in the area. And the trend of the weather movement 


is such that you're going into a -an even clearer 


area by tomorrow. The wind will be 090 at 10; 


visibility, 10; 2994 on the altimeter. It's of no 


consequence to the Navy guys, but the landlubber 


will be glad to learn that there is 3-foot wave 


heights, and the temperature is 77 degrees. Over.

And right now we haven't seen any specific spot 


to tie down the LEVAs. If you've got a recommendation, 
we'll take it. If not, we'll just pick a 
spot down in the LEB area to tie them down. 

Okay. I'll see if we have a plan for that. 


America, Houston. I've got an update to the news. 


Okay, Houston. America's listening. 


Okay. It's some more like human interest stuff 


rather than pure news. One thing the -in the 


Liberty Bowl football game Georgia Tech beat 


Iowa State. Well, I guess it's not quite over 
yet -this is a fourth quarter score, Georgia 
Teeh 31, Iowa State 24. And, there is a story 


about the Moonship that's streaking smoothly 
homeward. There's nothing in it that you don't 


know about, though, except maybe one little part 


of the article describing a quote from William E. 
Fastie of Johns Hopkins University, member of the 
Orbital Science Team3 who said that a rather 
startling discovery is the Moon is simply not 
degassing. It has nothing left in terms of anything 
that you think -that can create an atmosphere. 
Much to his surprise, even the amount of 
hydrogen, an element that should have been the 
most abundant outgassing candidate, turned out to 
be about i percent of its predicted value. He 
speculated that the absenco f a planetary magnetic 


field on the Moon works to the purge surface of 


any atmospheric accumulation. The atoms of gases 


that have vented to the surface, he theorized, 


pick up an electrical charge then -and are then 


swept away by the solar wind, which is a stream 
of electrified atoms pushing far out into the solar 


system of the Sun. Former President Truman is 


stabilized is the word they are using now. His 


heart condition is unchanged. His kidneys are 


failing him, and he's termed to be still in a very 
serious condition but resting comfortably. A 
declining birth rate and a desire for fewer children 
in the years ahead have caused the census bureau 


to reduce sharply its estimates of future popula


tion growth in the United States. By the year 


2000, for example, the estimate is now 20 million 


fewer people than had been forecast on the basis 



Tape 192/3 


of previous statistics. Reduction could have 
major implications for American society in many 
areas. And it reflects changes in birth and child 
planning, which now suggest that the U.S. may 
eventually reach zero population growth. The last 
one is pretty interesting, and more so if you can 
see the picture that goes with the story, about 
James L. G. Fitzpatrick who for 40 years has been 
interested in copying natural flight. And he has 
now designed a batlike flying machine that may be 
ready for a test run next summer. Fitzpatrick 
said that the first -that first, every small part 
of the ungainly structure must be tested carefully. 
Otherwise you end up either in a disaster or a 
grave, and we try to avoid that sort of thing. 
After three decades of trying, Fitzpatrick, who's 
66, believes his latest device comes closest to 


the real thing, although it still needs a small 
motor to flap the wings. Asked whether his device, 
as yet unnamed, works on the flight principle of 


a bird, he said, "I don't know anyone who knows 


f 
what principle a bird works on, but I guess this 
is more like a bat of a pterodactyl." Fitzpatrick's 
ornithopter or flapping wing airplane is equipped 
with cockpit controls that include a throttle that 
regulates the 1-horsepower engine and up-and-down 
flight. Other equipment includes rudder pedals 
to regulate a power steering system, a parking 
brake, a pseudopaddagieum, I don't know what that 


one -that word is, it's a new one on me, to transfer 
power from the engine to the wings, and a 
two-way radio. It has a maximum 40-foot wingspan 


and weighs 320 pounds. It is 6 feet long and it 
looks like a cage of scaffolding covered in parts 
by canvas. He said he's far enough along on build


ing his device that he will be able to test the 
way the wings move in the Staten Island Community 
College gym by the first of the year. However, 
there will be no free flying. The gymnasium test 
will involve tying weights to the wing tips and 
flapping the wings. He said that his bird is 


rather slow in maturing; and it's been a long 
gestation period which involved 9000 hours of 
experimentation, $40,000 in his money, and the 
dissection of 300 birds of various species. "I've 


been interested in flight since 1930," he said. 
"Basically, I was curious as to why various things 
flew, and I've been painfully finding out ever 



Tape 192/4 
since." And he winds up with a real quote here. 
He said, "Never has so much been done with so 
little success." That's the news. No, wait -
wait a minute. One final closing story. In 
Atlanta, Georgia, a 5-year-old boy crawled up on 
Santa's lap in a department store and asked him 
what Santa would need if he had two boots and 
one sock. Dick Wright, a Georgia State University 
graduate student in the off season, said he thought 
quickly and replied, "Another sock," and the child 
punched him in the stomach. 
LMP Huh! Merry Christmas.

CC Okay. The Surgeons are, first of all, request 
that Ron press on his sensors. They're looking

do with the LEVAs. I guess they were supposed to 
be on the helmets in the PGA bag. Is that going 
-to be a real pain to get at, and put them there? 
CDR No, it's not going to be a pain at all, Gordo; 
it's just impossible. 
CC Okay, well -
CDR There's just no room in there at all -not -none 
at all. 
CC Okay. I'll -probably not have an answer for you 
tonight, but first thing in the morning -someplace 
to put them. 
CDR Okay. It won't be any problem strapping them somewhere, 
but we thought maybe you had a better idea 
than we did; if not, when we get our reck bags 
tied down and all in place, we'll take a look at 
-a 
good spot for the LEVAs and let you know. 
CC Okay. G&C -I don't know where you are on the 
checklist -the -just a reminder to zero the 
optics before you turn in. And I'd like to -
say for the whole White Team, who are just -here 
in another hour, will finish up their -their work 
with the Apollo Program, and myself included, that 
this sure has been a pleasure working with not 
only the two best spacecraft the program has seen 
but we think the best and most cooperative and -
crew also. And it's been a privilege in my estimatio 
and a real pleasure, too, and looking 
forward to seeing you on Thursday. 
CDR Well, Gordo, those are awful kind words, and we 
do appreciate it very much, but I think you know 
how we feel about the help you guys give us down 
there. And -well, it really makes our job easy 
up here. From the Cape back to the Pacific is -
it's the guys from the trench all the way up to 
the top back there, and that's what it's really 
all about. We thank you, those are good words, 
but just consider them reciprocal also.

it's supposed to do. 


It's a -although there's not much of it to see, 


it's really sort of spectacular because the 


crescent is getting smaller and smaller although 
the Moon is getting -is getting larger, and of 
course the crescent we're looking at now is the 


Pacific. But even if there were landmasses in 


there, I don't think we could see much besides 


the reflection off the clouds -and a -well, in 
this case, the ocean. But -it's really a pretty 
spectacular sight because out the other window, 
now that we're on an intervertical [?] PTC, 
we've got a full Moon looking back at us. And 
it's sort of a poetic place to be the night before 


entry. 


Yes, I'll bet it is. 


Hang in there, babe, and we'll see you for sure 
Thursday.

candy. Meal Bravo, did not eat one-fourth of the 
fruitcake. Add on two tea, three-fourths jelly 


candy and graham cracker cubes. Meal Charlie, 
did not eat chicken stew. Add on one-fourth jelly 
candy. For breakfast, did not eat mixed fruit. 
Scratch the with K in the coffee. Drank the
