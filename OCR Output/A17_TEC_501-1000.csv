Do you want us to cycle cryo fans or just leave them alone now?||CC|We'd like them just left alone, left in you configuration you are now, Jack.||LMP|Okay, there will be no cycling then.||CC|Roger. We have one question. Who's got the duty tonight or will he be wearing a headset?||LMP|Yes, he - Ron has the duty. He will be wearing the headset, but I will be on the biomed underneath.||CC|Understand that. And one note for Gene. It's an addition to that Flight Surgeon's note. When you rehydrate your food, make sure that you go the -let it rehydrate for the maximum amount of time. I know you miss it on this one, but the next -like tomorrow morning, make sure it rehydrates the maximum amount of time.||LMP|Okay, I'll tell him.||CC|Roger.||LMP|And we got the star crater stereo trio.||CC|Roger.|03 22 45 09|LMP|And the - we're - mag - Oscar Oscar is on 93 now. The last three pictures were that trio.|03 22 48 25|LMP|Bob, we're ... complete on the presleep checklist. And except for computing communications configuration and Ron will take care of that.||||Tape 64/4||||CC|Roger.||LMP|And, Bob, while we're gradually getting in configuration here, let me reiterate something that I've been watching this rev as we did a lot of other things. And that was this relationship of the light-colored or light gray swirl patterns on the surface to patterns - associated pattern -parallel patterns that are darker than the average of the surrounding area. And this is true both in Mare Marginis and in most cases on the back side.||CC|Roger, Jack. We'll get that to the PI.||LMP|Roughly, although they're very irregular patterns -roughly it's concentric zoning of dark to light within a intermediate albedo surface. Now there are variations on that theme; sometimes you don't get the symmetry quite as good, but it's common enough that I think it's worth noting.||CC|Roger.||LMP|Also, there's a sequence of different kinds of crater filling on the far side, and I think that, as the orbital stay progresses, we may be able to pin down the relative age relationships and the characteristics of those crater fill - filling episodes. Whether they are single episodes that happen in a variety of crater or they're a function of the age and characteristics of the craters in which you find them is not clear right now, but the - they seem to form fairly distinct groupings of crater-fill material.||CC|Roger. Jack.|03 22 52 07|LMP|One of those crater-fill materials that you also see in other kinds of depressions other than craters is a very smooth, light, plains-forming material. And it is, although cratered, when you see it at the terminator, it is smoother than the mare; that is, it does not seem to have the swell, the sea swell characteristics or ridges or any other features other than the crater's superimposed on it.||||||Tape 64/5||CC|Roger. We copy.|03 22 55 19|CC|17s Houston. You can go ahead and close the UV cover. We'd like to hold off 1 minute before you turn the UV off. We want to look at 1 minute of data with the cover closed.||LMP|Oh, okay. Roger. A walkon. I see it now.|03 22 56 08|LMP|Okay, it's CLOSED.||CC|Okay s we'11 give you a cue when you go UV, OFF, and IKCO would like to know what you've got on your high gain pitch and yaw knobs. Not the dials but the knobs.||LMP|All right. The knobs are - let's see, about plus 20 and 185.||CC|Okay, PITCH of 20 and 185 on the YAW.||LMP|That's affirm.|03 22 58 22|CC|And, Jack, you can turn the UV off now.|03 22 58 38|LMP|Okay, it's OFF.|03 23 01 53|LMP|Okay, I got the landing site. We're right over the top of it, and the scarp is fantastically detailed at this - Can you see in there, Gene? Right down, right down, straight down there.||CDR|No, I can't.||LMP|Okay, well, the sli - the light mantle is ob -very obviously mantling the area. The scarp was very detailed, and, so far, could not see any structure in the massifs at all, but I haven't had any - didn't have much time to watch it on that pass.||LMP|The slide very definitely subdued the general detail in the plains area - or the light mantle, if you will, rather than slide. MOCR Crater was finally out of the dark.||||Tape 64/6||||CC|Roger.||CC|Jack, we'd like to know if you think you can adjust the high gain as close to plus 15 and YAW 190 as possible?|03 23 03 43|LMP|Okay, Bob, that's adjusted plus 15 and 190, and I suspect I was a little closer to 15 than 20 when I called you before.||CC|Roger.||LMP|I'll tell you, from this altitude and with that low Sun, there's no question of the sharpness of the topographic features in the landing area. The - The scarp, and - and even some of the apparent back - pardon - backflow features - and Parker will know what I'm talking about - that is apparent flows to the west in the light mantle area were extremely sharp, even those fronts going west were sharp. It looked even more like a mare ridge than it ever did before.||CC|Roger.|03 23 0.6 01|CDR|Okay, Bob, this is Gene. I had a - just a quick view of the site, and if we're anywhere near it, we'll recognize it, I think, without question. And, I think with that, we'll bid farewell and good night.||CC|Okay, gang. And looking for a busy day tomorrow - -||CMP|Never fear. Your old CM - -||CC|Go ahead; I cut you out.||CMP|"I said, ""Never fear, your CMP is watching."""||CC|Roger.

And as we're supposed to update your trajectory, which is looking good - predicted perilune at PDI without DOI-2 would be 11.9, a little lower.

Did you say 11.2 for perigee, now - without DOI-2?||CC|I might have said that. It's 11.9 predicted at PDI time withou DOI-2.||CMP|Okay. 11.9 predicted without - at PDI time without DOI-2.||CC|That's right.||CMP|Okay.

The other two are closed; mine is open, and I got the inner connect in between the other ones.||CC|Sounds good.||CMP|How's the old suit pressure? Okay. Looks like its pretty good. Okay. 02 flow is lower limit lot. Okay. Let's go up to PRESS. Here we go. That's going up to PRESS, and it feels like it's going up.|04 10 48 46|CMP|And terminal direct O2 on air to ...

Let's see, and there's a DELTA-P of about -6-1/2 - Now we're going to cycle suit circuit return air.||CMP|Okay. It's out; it's back in.||||||Tape 71B/9||CMP|Okay. Now we can squirt a little more O2 flow in.||CMP|Boom, boom - There we go. Man, oh man!||CMP|DIRECT 02 is off.||CMP|That's coming down. Shoot! I'm reading 4.5 in my suit. Is that right?||CMP|5?||CC|Looks like about 4 on our meter, Ron.||CMP|Well, I'll be durn. The old suit gage read 4.5*||CMP|... that close in there. Let's say at maybe nine or something like that. That's closer to four. Can't tell for sure what it feels like. Anyhow, the O2 flow is down. It's not leaking very much. I'm leaking about 0.3. Something like that.||CC|Okay. We're - we're showing 4.2 to 4.3 on our pressure spread, and you're cabin and suit pressure gages probably show something similar. And we show that the flow rate is down. -||CMP|Oh, okay. That's not too bad. That's pretty close.||CC|Yes. And the O2 flow is staying pretty good.||CMP|... let's go to DEPRESS on this thing, huh?||CC|Sounds good.||CMP|Okay; so it looks like it's sta - stable there, isn't it?||CC|Yes, sir.|04 10 52 l4|CMP|Okay. Let's go to DEPRESS.||CMP|... my ear are pretty good. I think I'm going to go to OFF. Save a little time here.||||Tape 71B/10||||CC|America, I don't know if I copied you correctly.

My ears are popping to beat the band - I changed my mind, I'll let it go down slowly.||CC|Okay.||CC|Okay. And we've got about 20 minutes before LOS, so there's no hurry on those pads. I've got them standing by when you're ready, and didn't know what you - what you had in mind about working on these things. We might get - you might get started on the hatch integrity check, if you get to that point, and I can give you the pads while you're waiting for it to bleed down or whatever it turns out to be convenient.||CMP|Okay. Let's see, I guess it's about time to -||CMP|Integrity check; okay.||CC|Okay. And I guess the LM is going to be asking you for a NOUN 20 pretty soon like, here.||CMP|Okay, Challenger; America here. I'll go back to CMC. Stand by. Okay.|04 10 54 58|CMP|GO. Okay; 002.15, 104.36, 359.69. And Houston, do we want to release those docking latches before they do their hot fire? I don't think so. Do we?||CC|I'll check. Stand by.||CMP|No.||||||Tape 71B/11||CC|You're right, Ron, we'll - we'll just hold up on that release on the latches until the hot fires are over.

Let's see - where are we going to start on the pads?||CC|Okay. And you might go to BLOCK on the computer, too.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay. The first thing I'll give you is the SEP pad.||CMP|Okay.

It is absolutely spectacular looking at that command module, America, down there coming across the surface. We're just tracking him at about a 30-degree dive angle.||CC|Sounds great.|04 12 18 30|CDR-LM|Okay, babe; have a good time, and go get that landmark. Don't forget - No TEIs. See you in about 3 days.||CC|Geno, Houston, with a couple of items.||LMP-IM|Go ahead, Gordo.||CC|Okay. Your perilune seems to be - -|04 12 19 39|CDR-LM|Hey, we got the landing site, Gordo.||CC|Okay. I'll hold - -||CDR-LM|Gordo, we got the landing site. We're coming right over the front of it. Stand by a minute. You can see the Slide. I think you can see the Great Cross.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|We'll get a picture of America coming right across it.||CC|All righty.||LMP-LM|Super targeting.||CDR-LM|Gosh, we've got Family Mountain; we've got - of course - the Massif; we can see the Scarp; we can see the light mantle; I've got the Great Cross, Camelot, Sherlock.||||||Tape 73A/5||LMP-lm|Believe it or not, Houston, they're all there.||CC|How about that.||LMP-IM|I see possible structure - possible structure in the upper part of the South Massif, little bit east of station 2. It's subhorizontal, dipping to the southeast.||CDR-LM|Houston, I can even see Poppy, right where we're going to set this baby down.||CC|Very good.||CDR-LM|As a matter of fact, I can see Rudolph. I can even see the triangle: Rudolph, Frosty, and Punk. Man, Gordo, this is absolutely spectacular.||CC|Sure sounds like it.|04 12 21 11|CDR-LM|We can watch Ron track - we can watch Ron track right on through the landmarks. I don't know what kind of results he got, but he sure had a nice smooth track from here.||CC|Roger.|04 12 21 38|LMP-IM|Gordo, you can go ahead and update us with those words.|04 12 21 4l|CC|"Okay. Your perilune is shifting west. PDI will be a little higher than nominal: 10.7 miles or 65,000 feet; should be no problem. And, from the time you first came around until we had a solid lockup on the steerable on this acquisition was about 3 minutes. We're going to try to speed that up some on the next time around. We'd like you to just keep trying the steerable until we come to you - and say, ""stop trying.""

(Laughter) Okay. 113:14:24.91. You happy with that?||LMP-LM|That looks good, sir.||CDR-LM|Okay.||LMP-LM|I got to change these numbers. You didn't get an update on NOUN 76, did you? I don't think so.||CDR-LM|No. No.||LMP-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|No. Okay; 5515* Hello, Gordy. How would you like me to handle R-3 of NOUN 76?|Ok 14 28 26|CC|Stand by. I'll come back to you.||CDR-LM|Okay. Oh, that radar performed super.||LMP-LM|How was the view on the way down, Gene? (Laughter)||CDR-LM|You know, after we pitched over, I was just looking for a place to land. I'm not sure, I just didn't want to hit one of those boulders out there which would have been as easy - and look at that. Look at right in front of us. I didn't want to land there either.||LMP-LM|I see that one right in front of us.||CDR-LM|You see that? ... a boulder, a hole.||LMP-LM|Where's the hole? I can't see the hole - -||||Tape 75A/6|||04 l4 28 58|CC|Challenger, Houston. R-3, cross range, is okay as is.||LMP-LM|Okay. Okay. We're coming up - -|04 14 29 11|CDR-LM|We're in posture for a T-2, Gordy.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|Okay. I can see the Scarp. I can see Hanover. Good thing we didn't plan to go to Hanover. (Laughter) It's steep.||LMP-LM|Look at the boulder - halfway up the hill.||CDR-LM|Yes,||LMP-LM|Not halfway, just enough - -||CDR-LM|Yes, the boulder tracks - they're beautiful.||LMP LM|It's sitting right there in the end of the tracks. There are tracks all over that hillside. There's a boulder came right down to the surface there. See it?||CDR-LM|Yes.||LMP-LM|That one right through that little crater -||CDR-LM|Yes.||LMP-LM|#NAME?||CDR-LM|Yes, sir. I'll bet Bare Mountain and the Sculptured Hills are the same.||LMP-LM|Yes. They - Well, the slope's different. We'll have to look at it from outside. You may be right. Now I see why they call them sculptured. Jfy gosh, they're so hummocky that there's shadow all over them.||CDR-LM|Yes.||||||Tape 75A/7||LMP-LM|Gosh, there are some holes and rocks around here. Who told me this was a flat landing site?||CDR-LM|It is flat. For crying out loud. What do you want, an airtight guarantee?|04 14 30 14|LMP-LM|Let's see, we got about 2 degrees left and about 5 degrees pitchup.||CDR-LM|We're about what - about 100 meters from Trident?||LMP-LM|Yes - yes, less than that, I think Trident's right here. Our shadow's about 100 feet, Geno, I think.||CDR-LM|Yes, we're only about - yes, less than 100 meters then. It doesn't look that long, but it ... - -||LMP-LM|Yes, there are some holes I'm glad I didn't land in around here, I'll tell you.||CDR-LM|Now, if you look at the massif, Jack. I don't know if you can see it over here. You see, they're almost like a series of linear boulder tracks, but they come crossways down the slope. So it looks like there may very definitely be some - some jointed - There's outcrop on top the massif, too.||LMP-LM|Oh, it sure looks like it, gray outcrop. And there's a bluish gray compared to the - the brown or tan gray of the massif side.||CDR-LM|And a lot of that boulder is - a lot of that outcrop down on the bottom is boulder.||LMP-LM|Yes. Do you know what that reminds me of, way up on top - that outcrop? It reminds me of sunset where you could just get a little piece of outcrop around the corner.||CDR-LM|That's right.|04 14 31 25|LMP-LM|Okay. Let's see what we're doing. We got 3 minutes for T-2. Let's take another check.||||Tape 75A/8||||CDR-LM|Okay. I just looked at them.||LMP-LM|Okay. Ascent looks good.|04 l4 31 36|CDR-LM|Gordy, I noticed something ever since we've landed. The oxidizer quantity went from - from 7 or 8, and now it's down to 2, and the fuel has stayed constant.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|And the QUANTITY light came on somewhere, I believe, after we landed.||LMP-LM|Yes, it did. I noticed the QUANTITY light also. I was thinking reg light, though, when I saw it. Oh, man.||CC|Challenger, we'll have a story on that for you later. We don't think we were really low level.||CDR-LM|Okay. It doesn't make any difference now, Gordy, expect to talk about when we get home.||CC|Roger.|04 14 32 27|CDR-LM|And we're 2 minutes and counting to T-2.||CC|Roger.||LMP-LM|We better hurry if - you're going to give - they're going to give us the GO.||LMP-LM|How about some water?||CDR-LM|Yes, you can zap me.||LMP-LM|Oh, I tell you. That's something everyone's got to do once in their life. I want to - We're not going to have much time for T-2 - -|04 14 33 18|CC|Challenger, Houston. You're STAY for T-2, and GO for the DPS vent.||LMP-LM|Okay.||||||Tape T5A/9||CDR-LM|Okay. Understand. STAY for T-2, and GO for the DPS vent. Let me get out of - Okay, we can't hack that. I'm going to get out at 12.||LMP-LM|Excuse me, Gene.|04 14 33 46|CDR-LM|Okay. You can unzap that water, if you'd like. And let's go off VOX. Let's go on PTT.|04 14 34 41|CDR-LM|Okay. REG 1 is CLOSED, Houston; OXIDIZER FUEL VENTS coming OPEN.||CC|Roger.|04 14 34 45|CDR-LM|MASTER ARM, ON. MASTER ARM's coming ON. Okay, Gordo. I got two good lights.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|DESCENT VENT, FIRE. Okay -|04 14 35 01|CDR-LM|MARK it. Now we did not hear anything on that one, Gordy.||CC|Roger.|04 14 35 11|CDR-LM|... pressure's coming down, though. Pressure's coming down.|04 14 35 IT|LMP-LM|Okay. MASTER ARM, OFF. Okay. We'll monitor oxidizer pressure until 20 to 40, and then OX VENT, CLOSED; fuel pressure to less than 8. FUEL VENT.|04 14 35 28|CDR-LM|DESCENT QUANTITY light - REG light. Excuse me.|04 14 35 36|CDR-LM|Okay. MODE CONTROL, two to ATT HOLD. Well, we just keep going, I guess.||LMP-LM|Yes. Hey, we can press on. Okay. Okay. Now wait a minute. Here we go. Let's get that. Go up here first, because I haven't selected it.|04 14 36 03|LMP-LM|Okay. ECA CONTROL is CLOSED.

(Laughter) Out, I guess.|04 i4 37 51|LMP-LM|INVERTER 2 is selected. Okay. And DECA POWER, OPEN. And guess what? Take your helmet and gloves off.|04 l4 38 59|LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. We're in 1-1. Helmets and gloves are off, DIVERTER VALVES are IV.||CC|Okay. We're right with you.|04 14 39 16|LMP-LM|And you're looking at NOUN 20.||LMP-LM|Window shades are going close. I just - I'm using it instead of a light switch because I've got it covered up.||CDR-LM|Gordy, you got NOUN 20?|04 l4 40 26|CC|That's affirmative. We copy NOUN 20.||CDR-LM|Okay. Jack's going to pick up the AGS - on the right side of that page, and I'll part the antenna||CC|Roger.|04 14 43 01|CDR-LM|P20's in work. Correction, P57's in work.||||||Tape 75A/11|04 14 43 13|CC|Challenger, Houston. Your DPS OXIDIZER PRESSURE||CDR-LM|is 40 or less. You can close it. Thank you, Gordy.||CDR-LM|Gordy, while the P57 is doing its gravity work,||CC|let me say that the LNA and the landing site, from a relief point of view, I - I think, are identical. I - I couldn't say enough for the LNA. I actually didn't look around nearly as much as I thought I would, or as I wanted to, because I had fixation on - on a reasonable spot to land. They're not all reasonable in that there's some very subtle hummocky-like craters right in and around where we are. And there's not a - a lot of boulders laying on the surface, but there's a lot of what appear to be boulders that are covered up by some of the dark mantle. Numerous enough that you would not like to take a chance at putting a - a pad down on one of them or in one of those hummocky subtle craters. As a result, I really didn't have a chance to look all around at where I wanted to except to put the bird down where I wanted it. Okay. We've got no complaint with that.||CDR-LM|I guess the thing that probably - probably sur-||CC|prised me most about the site, as far as landing is concerned, is the fact that there were these -these - I hesitate to say they're outcrops but certainly they're buried massive pieces of rock -whether they're boulders or not, we'll have to find out - out here in the plains area, partially covered and filleted by the dark mantle. And I expected to find a number of craters, but I guess I really didn't expect to find - to find the -the rock types around. And we're talking about anywhere from 1 to 2 meters down to - oh, 2 or 3 feet, which when they're sticking out and on the sides of some of these subtle craters look pretty menacingly. But that probably is the one thing that surprised me most. Roger, Gene.||||Tape 75A/12|||04 14 45 49|CDR-LM|The visibility prior to pitchover was such that I could see Nansen. I could see the Scarp. I could see Lara. I could not see Camelot until after pitchover. However, once I had pitchover, if I could have froze it right there like we do in the simulator occasionally, I could have picked out everything there was to see. Even at 6000 feet, the small triangle with Frosty and Rudolph and Punk were visible to me. I had - I had Poppy from orbit, as a matter of fact, so it was -easily - easy to see. Barjea was a very sharp round crater just as depicted on the LNA. The thing I really didn't get a good look at, because I didn't pay too much attention to it, was from Trident on to the south.||CC|Roger.||LMP-LM|Gordy, this is the LMP. Let me say - Gordy, this is the LMP. Let me say that the inside of the spacecraft looked just like the simulators.||CC|Very good, Jack.||CDR-LM|Another interesting thing, Gordy. All the way through PDI prior to pitchover, Jack and I had -had the real America - or the other America -right out - smack out the front window all the way down, which was pretty spectacular.|04 14 47 21|CC|I bet it was. And you can consider yourself STAY for T-3.||CDR-LM|Thank you, sir. You're getting smoother all the time. If you're happy with NOUN 22, I'll PRO.||CC|Stand by 1.|04 14 4? 46|CC|You're clear to PRO.|04 14 48 4l|LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. I had the angles matched on the steerable and went to SLEW, and they - it held for a few seconds and then dropped off.||||||Tape 75A/13||CC|Okay. It looks pretty good. You might try to peak it up just a little more.|04 14 49 01|LMP-LM|No, we're on an omni now.||CC|Roger.|04 ik 49 12|LMP-IM|I'll try the steerable one more time here.||CC|Okay, you should be - -|04 14 49 22|LMP-LM|Okay. We're on the steerable, and I'm not going to touch it.|04 14 49 35|LMP-LM|It's steerable and SLEW, and I got 3.8.||CC|Okay. That looks good to us, Jack.||CC|Jack, we'd like you to verify the TAPE RECORDER, OFF.|04 14 50 12|LMP-LM|Yes, that's verified, Gordy.||LMP-LM|Gordy, how does the fuel vent look to you?|04 14 51 04|CC|Okay. Looks like 8 to us. You can go ahead and close it.||LMP-LM|Anyway, it - Okay. I already did.|04 14 58 28|CDR-LM|Gordy, I - I guess I'm puzzled on that one. I had the right star. You see anything we did wrong?||CC|Stand by. We're checking.|04 14 59 52|CC|Gene, our only guess is that you might have loaded NOUN 88 wrong. We'd like you to start over, and we'll watch you real close again.|04 15 00 05|LMP-LM|Gordy. Listen, I think we know what we did. We loaded SPRL for CRSR, and CRSR for SPRL. How would it be if we went through the P57 again and -Yes - we'll - I guess we got to do it all over. Those old numbers are no good anymore.||CC|Okay.||||Tape 75A/14||||LMP-LM|I - you can - I'm sure that's what we did. We loaded CRSR for SPRL, and SPRL for CRSR.||CC|Okay. And it's our fault, too. We should have watched that.|04 15 01 51|CC|Jack, this is Houston. We do have the pre-PDI AGS cal numbers. You won't need to read them to us.||LMP-LM|Okay.||´CDR-LM|Gordy, you going to want a recycle on this gravity measurement? I doubt if it'll need it.||CC|Stand by. No, no recycle necessary this time through.||CDR-LM|Okay.|04 15 02 32|I24P-LM|Gordy, ED BATs are 37-2.||CDR-LM|Gordy, let me comment about the handling of the bird. After you once fly it around in orbit a little bit, you get accustomed to the thrusters, and it - it came back to me quite a bit from 10, anyway. And you get a feel for acceleration and deceleration as well as the attitude hold capability. And it really - the response, even with a heavy descent - descent stage near the surface -is phenomenal. Responded exactly in the direction I wanted, held attitude very good. And, let me tell you, the LLTV plays no small part in this landing as far as I'm concerned.||CC|Roger, Gene.|04 15 03 45|LMP-LM|Okay. NOUN 22 again. I'll go ahead and torque them.||CC|Okay. Go ahead.|04 15 10 18|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. It's a little better.||CC|Roger. Looks good.||||||Tape 75A/15|04 15 10 28|LMP-LM|Computer is NOUN 93.|04 15 10 48|CC|Okay. Torque it.||CC|Challenger, Houston. We're standing by for the dumps.|04 15 11 38|LMP-LM|Okay, Gordo. I'm ready to give the E-mem -Coming at you -|04 15 11 46|LMP-LM|MARK it. It's on the way.|04 15 12 58|CDR-LM|Gordy, one other thing about the landing. I saw the light, I think. And I heard Jack call it -the CONTACT light. I think I waited about a second and - and hit the stop button. She shut down immediately. And, of course, you could feel the fall. I don't really feel we fell that much, but it was quite a change In acceleration at that point.||CC|Roger, Gene.||CDR-LM|And I guess I had, from what I would guess, a foot or 2 for - per second forward on that one.||CC|Okay. Sounds good.||CDR-LM|And let me know when I can have the computer, please|04 15 14 13|CC|Okay. It's your computer. And I'm standing by with parking angles when you're ready to load them.||CDR-LM|Okay. We'll be ready in a second.||LMP-LM|Go ahead with the angles.|04 15 15 02|CC|Okay. These are the IMU parking angles. Plus 295.86. I see you're loading the radar. Do you just want to load these or write them down?||LMP-LM|Go ahead. I'm writing.|04 15 15 29|CC|Okay. Y will be plus all zeros. And plus 084,l4, Over.||||Tape 75A/16||||LMP-LM|Okay. NOUN 20 will be plus 295.86, plus all zeros, plus 084.14.||CC|That's correct.|OU 15 16 16|LMP-M|Okay, Houston. I'm going to power down the AGS, if you're willing.||CC|Not yet, Jack. We'd like you to read out 047 and 053 to us.||LMP-LM|Okay. You want the new ones.|04 15 16 46|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. If you're happy with NOUN 22, I'll ENTER them.||CC|We're happy.||CDR-LM|Okay. And it just dawned on me. I'm sorry about the zero on the NOUN 69. (Laughter)||CC|That's okay. You're forgiven.||CDR-LM|I appreciate that.|01+ 15 17 24|CC|Okay, Jack. We got 047 and 053.||LMP-LM|Okay. Am I GO to PULL the breakers?|04 15 18 01|CDR-LM|Okay. Are you happy with NOUN 20?|04 15 18 14|CC|Okay. We're happy with NOUN 20, and you're clear to power down the AGS.||LMP-LM|Okay,|04 15 19 37|LMP-LM|Gordy, the breakers are coming OPEN on 1-4 and 1-5||CC|Roger.|04 15 22 11|CDR-LM|Gordo, we're on 1-6.||CC|Okay, Thank you.||||||Tape 75A/17|04 15 31 31|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston. We're at the bottom of 1-8, and I'm standing by for your lift-off times.|04 15 31 38|CC|Okay, Jack. Lift-off time for rev 15 is 116:55:51', 16 is 118:54:28; 120:53:04; 122:51:40; 124:50:17; 126:48:53. Over.|04 15 32 27|LMP-LM|Okay. Starting with rev 15, 116:55:51; 118:54:28; 120:53:04; 122:51:40; 124:50:17; 126:48:53.||CC|That's a good readback.|04 15 35 11|CDR-LM|Gordo, the PLSS is against the hatch, and we're installing the BRA.||CC|Roger on that.|04 15 48 22|CC|Challenger, Houston. We've got three questions for you to help pin down your exact position, any time it's convenient. Maybe when you're taking the out-the-window pictures. Over.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordo. I think we can give it to you. Why don't you wait? We're just getting the - the mag bag out and jett bags out from behind the engine cover here, to give you an idea where we are.||CC|Okay. No hurry at all.||CDR-LM|I had it pinned down for you, until I got to about 500 feet, when I changed my mind.||CC|Roger.|04 15 50 17|CDR-LM|Gordy, we're not going any further, and we'll answer your questions here when we get some time, tfcr best guess is 150 meters from Poppy at 1 to 2 o'clock.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||CDR-LM|And I'll bet on that one. But we'll get with you in a minute.||CC|Okay. 150 north-northwest of Poppy.||||Tape 75A/18||||CDR-LM|Yes. Mostly west, but slightly north.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|I'll tell you the - we're abeam, I think, just about abeam of Trident 1. I can see it out there, but I can't really define Trident 1 from Trident 2. And the thing that is a little different is that I appear to be closer to it than I normally would have expected to be.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|That's probably as close as the Navy Captain could ever guess where he is anyway.|04 15 51 56|CC|Roger.

And, of course, I got a barber pole as it was going up. Okay; you want to try RETRACT again?||CC|That's affirmative.|04 16 10 32|CMP|Okay. HF for number 1 to RETRACT, now. And a barber pole.||CC|Ron, we'd like you to turn it OFF now.|04 16 li i4|CMP|Okay; it's OFF, and the talkback is gray.|04 16 13 56|CC|Ron, Houston here. On that one, we followed your RETRACT current in for 7 seconds, and then it went into stall; so it apparently is the track -it's retracting normally up to a point, and then goes into stall. We'd like you to press on and do EXTEND on HF ANTENNA 2. And we're going to press on here, probably thinking like maybe we won't get the antennas in. And on ANTENNA 2 - -||CMP|Okay.||CC|- - it's - it's according to the Flight Plan, barber pole plus 2 seconds.||CMP|Okay; we'll go barber pole plus 2.|04 16 14 31|CMP|Okay. Number 2, EXTEND. Barber pole 1001, 1002, Off. Okay; number 2 going to RETRACT, now. Barber pole 1001, 1002. Hey! Okay; it went gray - and back to OFF.||CC|Roger. We copy that.||CC|Okay, Ron. You're GO for the extending, and just a reminder on the Flight Plan, there's a RECORDER, ON, prior to the EXTEND there.||||||Tape 75B/5||CMP|Oh, okay; that's good.|04 16 15 28|CMP|Okay. RECORDER'S going ON. And we'll extend number 1. Let me get the clock going here. Okay; 3, 2, 1 -|04 16 15 44|CMP|MARK it.||CC|Currents are looking good. The extension is looking normal, so far. And the Aerobee rocket had some problem - -||CMP|Okay; great.||CC|- - and didn't get a chance to look at the Sun.||CMP|Uh-oh.||CC|And they're going to try and launch a couple more the day after tomorrow.||CMP|Very good.|04 16 16 45|CMP|Hey, I think I can see a light spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff.||CC|Roger. Interesting, interesting comment.||CMP|It's between Sherlock and Camelot - between -|04 16 17 00|CMP|Hey, it's gray now on the number 1 EXTEND.||CC|Roger. We got it.

The currents look normal on number 2 while it extends.||CMP|Okay.|04 16 18 17|CMP|Hey, I can see number 2.||||Tape 75B/6||||CC|Roger. That's good show. It's going to be moving, Ron.||CMP|All the way out there. It is?||CMP|My window's all fogged up here, and can't see a thing.||CC|Roger.||CC|Okay, Ron. We show it all the way out - -||CMP|Fogged up on the ... side ...||CC|#NAME?|04 16 19 09|CMP|Okay; we'll turn it off.||CMP|Houston, this is America.||CC|Go ahead, Ron.||CMP|I didn't have my map there, but I was looking at the landing site, and as close as I can remember, it had to be somewhere around about DN 83.3 on the 200-meter scale, the TL25-8.||CC|Okay, Ron. I'm coming up on some Flight Plan operations on the mapping camera that you might want to check.||CMP|Thank you.||CMP|Okay.|04 16 23 58|CMP|Probably dark down there.

I dug out the map TL 25-8, and I got the 83-3, but what was the azimuth coordinate on that, Ron?||CMP|It was Dog November, and maybe just a little bit to the right of Dog November.||CC|Okay; Dog November. Thank you. And you think that's where they are, huh?||CMP|Yes.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Well, there's the - there's a real white spot down there, you know. And I didn't have - I only got a short - I only got a look at that thing for about 30 seconds before I had to so something else. But I'm just re - re - recalling in my mind where the - where the white spot is with respect to those - there's Camelot and there's Sherlock, and them from Camelot to Sherlock, there were two other craters, and they were just a little bit closer to Camelot, but between those two other craters there.||CC|Good show. Roger.||CMP|There's a white spot - yes, there's a white spot on the - like it might have been dust blowing or something, you know.||CC|Roger. That may be the - the rocket exhaust. It might be just a little off that light spot.||CMP|Yes.||CC|Okay, Ron. We're ready for LUNAR SOUNDER, OPERATE to OPERATE. And if you'll give me a mark, I'll time it out for you.||CMP|Okay.

LUNAR SOUNDER, STANDBY.||CC|Roger, Ron. Just for your information, whatever we could read down here was looking great.||CMP|Hey, great!||CC|Both HF and VHF look good, and we saw no visible interference on the CSM telemetry.||||||Tape 75B/9||CMP|Hey, outstanding! That's great.||CMP|Now, if the old antenna would come back in, we'd be in good shape, huh?||CC|Yes, sir.|04 16 39 56|CMP|Okay; we're maneuvering to VHF test attitude.|04 16 46 26|CMP|Okay, Houston. I'm about ready to press ahead, if you all are?||CC|Stand by on that, Ron. Okay, Ron. We are all ready to press on.|04 16 46 53|CMP|Okay. HIGH GAIN ANTENNA POWER is ON. We go to MANUAL and WIDE.

And HIGH GAIN ANTENNA POWER is going OFF.||CC|Roger.||CC|We just want to give you some fair warning, Ron. When you come around AOS next time at 116:30, it's a - Flight Plan update. We got quite a lengthy update on the Flight Plan - all orbital picture work, but quite lengthy.||CMP|Okay. Are you going to try to pull that antenna back in first before we completely change the Flight Plan?||CC|Ron, we're going to take a good hard look at that, and see if we can generate up either a test on that or what. That's kind of in limbo right now, Ron. These Flight Plan changes - -||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|- - these Flight Plan changes I've got for you coming up later will be all some items Farouk has on camera pictures on the - that spot Jack thought he saw the light spot and a few other changes.||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|And, Ron, just for your information, regardless of what we do on that antenna, we won't have any Flight Plan changes until after 144 hours due to that antenna.||CMP|Oh! Okay,||CC|Ron, we would like Hg tank 2 FANS to ON.|04 16 54 00|CMP|tank 2 FANS are ON, now.||CC|Okay, Ron. You're lucky you're up there tonight,, Ron. We're having really ratty weather down here.

Voices will be pretty marginal the rest of the way out.|04 17 00 27|CMP|Just about to lose you.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 76A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|04 15 58 37|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston, we're just starting our eat period. Sorry to be a little behind. PRD readings are 17037 and LMP is 24117-||CC|Okay, Jack. We got that.||CC|Would you verify your BIOMED, RIGHT?||LMP-LM|Yes, that's verified. How does it look?||CC|Looks good.|04 16 01 11|CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. We're starting to cut into a little lunch here and, if you've got any questions, why don't you come up with them now?||CC|Okay. We're wondering if you can give us estimate of the angular position, clock position of Rudolph. And can you line up Rudolph with a horizontal feature out beyond it?||CC|I - I should say horizon feature - out in the distance, not horizontal.||CDR-LM|Okay. I thought Rudolph was right out there at 3 o'clock. Jack's looking at it and he said, yes, that is Rudolph right at 3 o'clock out his right-hand window.||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|I don't know if it'll mean anything to you, but the shadow of the LM, the rendezvous radar antenna is pointing about one-third of the way down from the peak of Family. And that, I know, is pretty gross. And, Gordo, I - I must be right here abeam of Trident 1. The only reason I hesitate is that I'm so close - but it's probably, well I guess it's close to 100 meters - 80 meters anyway -to where the - where the rim of Trident 1 falls off. And I am abeam of the center of Trident 1, and that's the only possible thing it could be. And that would put Poppy just about where I expected it to be.||||Tape T6A/2||||CC|Okay.||CC|We just want to confirm. You're referring to Trident 1 as the easternmost part of Trident, is that right?||CDR-LM|No, sir, Gordo. It's always been the westernmost part of Trident. The - the landing site was on a line between Trident 1 and Rudolph and judging from what Jack's got on his right-hand window and what I got on my left-hand window we're right there, except possibly a skosh further south on that line.||CC|Okay, understand.||LMP-LM|And the target point that was in the PGNS was right up where we all had expected it to be about halfway between here and what we're calling the rim of Camelot. We can't see into Camelot; we can just see the rim of it. It's several - oh, at least 200 meters - 2 to 300 meters up there, I expect.||CC|Okay, what o'clock position is the west - the nearest part of the rim of Camelot? Or maybe if it's better defined - -||LMP-LM|12 o' clock.||CC|#NAME?||CDR-LM|Yes, Gordy, but it - it blends in so well; all we're seeing is a - an undulating high as the rim. And to the best of my knowledge, we've got the south rim at - or correction, the east rim right at 12 o'clock. Hey, Gordy, right at 12 o'clock also is a boulder that's at least 3 meters and maybe 5, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you can find it. It's on a line between us and the intersection of the South Massif and the Family Moun - Mountain horizon. Just slightly left of that line or south of that line. And that boulder ought to show up on your best photography.||||||Tape 76A/3||CC|Okay, Jack. We'll take a look. One other question - -||LMP-IM|And it's at - it's at least - that boulder's at least 200 meters away.||CC|Okay* Can you see the west rim of Trident, and can you give us a clock position on the west rim of West Trident?||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. The west rim of Trident, which, by the way, is full of outcropping-looking boulders, is at 10 o'clock.||CC|Okay, Gene - -||CDR-LM|Okay, I can look back around the corner now and I can - I can see where the east - where Trident 1 rose up to its rim on the east side, and I would say we're abeam of a point - abeam of a.point one-third the way from east to west up the center of Trident; that is, we're - we've covered one-third of Trident 1 and we're abeam of a point of a line that goes through the one-third point from east to west of Trident 1.||CC|Okay, Gene; that's very clear. I think we've got you pretty well nailed down. And you're pretty close to the - the planned landing site.||CDR-LM|Yes, I think it's very close to our planned landing site and I - I'm (chuckle) - I'm anxious to see where Poppy is, because I think what I said earlier is true.||CC|Okay. That's all the questions now. Enjoy your dinner.|04 16 10 24|LMP-LM|Houston, I have calmed down, but be advised that our dinner is corn chowder.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|He went to captain's mast for eating that the other day.||||Tape 76A/4|||04 16 16 09|LMP-LM|Gordy, Houston; 17. How do you read - or Challenger or whoever we are?||CC|Whoever you are; you're loud and clear.||LMP-LM|I took the binocs and looked at some large boulders at our 12 o'clock position. They're probably on the order of a half meter to 2 meters, buried but without strong filleting. And most of them that I could see had the same mottled light-gray and medium-gray texture, and it looked like there's a lineation in it. And whatever the mottling is, it's on a frame size or fragment size of a - or a few centimeters, and it looks as if it's very uniform in that mottling; that is, there's one -one fragment size.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|There are a few near one crater out at 12 o'clock -dark-gray rock that may be glass coated. Matter of fact, one of them looks like it's right at the rim and might have been part of a projectile that made the crater.||CC|Roger.|04 16 17 47|LMP-LM|The large boulder that I mentioned that's several meters in diameter - I'm not even sure it's a boulder - It does have a well-developed fillet. It's highly fractured. It looks like the fractures generally are north-south. At least you can't -we can't see end on into the fractures. And it's too far away to be sure, but it looks like it's mottled also, although there did appear in the bin - in the monocular to be a more heterogeneous mottling. It might be a breccia.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|That boulder ought to be very close to the ALSEP site.||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 76A/5||CDR-LM|Gordo, in reference to these boulders, everywhere I can see out of my left window and out ahead of me in referring to that boulder Jack's talking about which is just a little bit on my side at 12 o'clock, it appears that the dark mantle has filleted and, for the most part, covered - or it has covered part of or is up on top of some of the crevices and the crannies in the boulders themselves, with the exception of - Well, I'll take that back - even the very small ones. I'd say from a population point of view, boulders of the size Jack's talking about that are visible through the surface anywhere from 1 to 2 to 3 meters - a very small percentage, but when you look at them at our level, it looks like they are quite populous. I'd say there are maybe about 25 of them in view between myself and the - where the horizon falls off down away from us towards the South Massif. The area back towards Station 1, at least the other side of Trident, looks like it's more heavily strewn with some of these filleted and partially mantled large fragments.||CC|Roger, Gene.||LMP-LM|To say that there is a boulder, as such, actually sitting on the surface, I can't - I really can't find one, unless they're along - around something very small and possibly younger craters. But I think for the most part everything is somewhat mantled.||CC|Okay.|04 16 20 48|LMP-LM|Gordy, I think maybe the predictions of a fairly thin regolith were good. I have a crater at about - oh, 130 feet. It looks like it's not more than a meter deep. It's very fresh, has a bright halo around it, and it's very rocky in its Interior and has some rocks that are at least 10 or 20 centimeters in diameter on the rim. It looks like it's penetrated into some rockier - much rockier substrate than what we're seeing on the surface. The surface itself looks like a - oh, probably 15 percent fragments greater than half a centimeter.||||Tape J6A/6||||CC|Okay, Jack.||LMP-IM|I don't see any general si - I don't see any general size, Gordy. I do have a crater out here that's - maybe a meter in diameter that - fairly fresh, although not bright halo - that has not penetrated to blocky material. And it looks like that the saturation crater size is very small in the area we can see; that is, there don't seem to be any old or very subdued craters - Well, let me -let me think about how to put that again. They're -It's obviously saturated with craters a few centimeters in diameter, but when you get bigger than that, there seems to be more of a - a clear distribution rather than a saturation.||CC|Okay.|04 16 23 02|LMP-LM|Gordy, let me give you a quick far horizon. At 12 o'clock, I've got Family Mountain. It's a -it and South Massif are a replica from their plane form where I - up from where I am, except that Family Mountain is much more symmetrical and rounds off to a very more definite peak. The South Massif, in turn, has got a high plateau, a high flat peak on top. My far horizon then, at 12 o'clock, from about - to 11:30 is dominated by Family Mountain. It's - Well, I hate to use the word anorthosite without getting out of the spacecraft, but it sure is white. It sure is white, but its varied shades of white - with - sort of a -a tendency on its southern or southeastern slope to sort of be marble caked with a darker material much the same color as the mantle that we're - we've landed on. The Family Mountain disappears just about at the level of the rim of Camelot on my far horizon and just in front of it - It starts out - that's at about 11 o'clock - it just - just there is where the South Massif starts up very abruptly - I'd say - well, I'll try not to overestimate, but certainly 30 degrees, I'd say - very abruptly to a very impressive altitude. I know I was at 13,000 when I said I was at their level, but - it sure looked it from there. It - it plateaus off from about 10:30 to about 9;30, and then||||||Tape ?6A/7|||it starts sloping back down towards the east at about the same angle. Very symmetrical. There are several places where you can see what appear to be outcrops. I say several - about a dozen anyway, where you can see relatively large areas of outcrop on the South Massif. That outcrop is a - of a darker gray color than the white-gray of the Massif itself. The one most domineering -dominant outcrop is right at the change in slope to the west, where it goes upslope and then plateaus off, and there is a definite outcrop. And you can see several boulders on all levels of the Massif that have come apparently from outcrops and I feel certain we will be able to get to some of those - that have come all the way down. South Massif, too, is a - appears to be in areas marbly caked dirty, such as if it was sprinkled with a dirty or a darker covering, and that covering is more evident as - as it slopes back here towards the - towards the east. As the far horizon now, I can see - I can see - South Massif all the way to 9 o'clock, but then behind it, there's just a little breadloaf-type dome of a much darker, much more hummocky mound back there, relatively big. It's probably, from where I stand, at least 10 percent the - the size of the Massif, the South Massif. Gray in texture. There appear to be some lineations running - well, as I'm looking at them, they're dipping down into the west at about 20 degrees, but that may be a Sun-angle problem. But they're definitely there. And then, contrasting that is - is Bare Mountain which is also much darker gray, much different than the Massif from where I stand, much more hummocky surface. It appears to be to me what I would expect Sculptured Hills to be like. One other thing about the South Massif is that - as I look at - as I look at it -at about 9:30 to 10:30, there is a little knob of the South Massif that sort of flows toward -towards the east or slightly towards the northeast. That's the one that tends to be a little bit more heavily covered with the - darker dusty material - -|04 16 28 06|CC|Challenger, Houston, over.||||Tape 76A/8||||LMP-LM|There are. Go ahead.||CC|Okay. We're about 12 - 13 minutes behind the time line for starting cabin preps. And backroom is enjoying your descriptions, but we think we'd rather you press on with the preps and get ready to get out for a really good view. Over.||LMP-LM|Okay* Gordy. We're - we're doing this and eating too - We're trying to do them both at the same time, and we are pressing. Just want to say one other thing about the Massif. I can see a couple of places where craters have - have penetrated very small craters and penetrated the Massif -craters maybe a meter or 2 in size, some 5 meters, and there's a lot of rock debris around them, which tends to believe that there is very little, if any, soft covering on that Massif.||CC|Roger.||LMP-LM|Gordy, just a couple more words about the North Massif. It looks like a good distribution of boulder tracks. Many of the boulders are accessible. They are - the tracks can be traced up, at least to midslope. That's at my 3 o'clock position And occasionally, at that midslope position, particularly northwest of Henson, you can see abun-dent boulders suggestive of outcrop. That's something that we had missed seeing on the pre-mission photos. But - And it isn't as abundant as on the South Massif, but there are apparent ledge formers about midslope.|04 16 30 08|CDR-LM|Yes, let's make ... I don't know ... a lot of ... No way it could be 1.||CDR-LM|Give me that ... throw away.|04 16 31 03|LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. There's also a few very bright sparks - sparkles from the surface - not abundant, but a few.||CDR-LM|Well, let me - I - I need these.||||||Tape 76A/9|04 16 33 52|CC|Challenger, Houston. I'm going to hand you over to the good Dr. Parker here. Have a good trip outside there.||CDR-LM|Gordy, thank you. You do outstanding work and we sure do appreciate it, babe.||CC|My pleasure.|04 16 37 12|CDR-LM|Bob, we'll give you a call in a minute. We just made a couple of suit adjustments.||CC|Okay. Copy that.|04 16 40 38|CC|Apollo 17, Houston.||CDR-LM|Go ahead, Bob.||CC|Okay, Challenger; we've just lost about 16 dB on your high gain signal strength there. We're wondering if you happened to hit the switch there, has it moved, or could you give us a check on it?||CDR-LM|We're nowhere near it. Stand by 1.||CC|Okay. And, Challenger, that should be a PITCH of 21 and a YAW of minus 45*||CDR-LM|Plus 21 and minus 45; Roger. Bob, about 2 minutes here.|04 16 46 30|LMP-LM|Bob, this is Jack. On that high gain, I'm up close to 39 now,, which is better than when we landed. Do you want me to do anything to it?||CC|Stand by on that.||CC|Leave it alone. It seems to have gone away, Jack. It may have been a ground problem.||CC|Did you guys adjust it, Jack?||LMP-IM|Yes, Bob. We had to fix the drink bags and a couple other things.||||Tape 76A/10||||CC|No. Did you guys adjust the high gain antenna?||LMP-LM|No. I didn't touch it.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-LM|Buddy SLSS's in there?||LMP-LM|No. That's over there. Oh, did they? *** in there? I don't - I thought it was over on your side. Okay? Okay, that's over there.

You might make a point of reminding us to bring them back.||CC|Okay. I copy that. Never did find Ron's, huh?||CDR-LM|No, sir, and I couldn't just leave him up there starving to death.||CC|Roger on that.||CDR-LM|By the way, how's he doing?||||||Tape 76A/11||CC|Stand by.||CC|Challenger, Houston.

Looks like you're with me now.||CC|That's affirmative, America. We read you loud and clear.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Did you get the pan camera start time there, Ron?||CMP|That's affirm. But, I got a 31:11 instead of 31:10.||CC|Oh, Roger. No problem.||CMP|Okay. (Laughter) I'll try to do better next time.||CC|America, is the bird in good shape?||CMP|So far as I know.||CC|Okay, great. Anytime you want to start taking a Flight Plan update, just let me know.||CMP|Okay. (Cough) Give me a little bit of time to lead into the landing site there, and we can go ahead and do it now.||CC|Okay.||CC|"The first thing is at 119:00, 119:00. Add the following words, Ron: ""Configure camera."" In parenthesis, ""Earthshine photos. CM5, command module 5 window/November Kilo. Nikon/55/VHBW."" That's Victor Hotel Bravo Whiskey."||CMP|Okay.||CC|In parenthesis; f/1.2, 1, infinity, end of parenthesis. Eighteen frames FR - 18 FR.||||Tape 76B/2||||CMP|Good.||CC|Magazine Zulu Zulu.||CMP|Okay, got it.||CC|"Okay. Go down to 119:24 and add the following. Let me just read it to you in - quickly here, so you can put in the words you want to. The words are ""Point at target marked by LMP. Use same technique as for Copernicus central peak."""||CMP|Okay. We'll point at the target by the LMP. Use the same technique, which is starting out at 1 second - -||CC|Roger, Let me read it to you.||CMP|- - was it 30 seconds?||CC|Roger, 1 second, two frames; 1/2 second, two frames; 1/4 second, two frames; 1/8 second, two frames; l/l6 second, two frames. On Copernicus, we're using a 30-second interval. It's not important, - the interval. It's mainly just the stop settings on that. You're going to use a total of 10 frames.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay, then add the following after that: After completion of above, switch to window CB3. For 8 frame of end of target, Papa 17 Delta. At 30-second intervals. Record frame number.|04 17 59 52|CMP|Okay, I've got to switch to window number 3 for end of target. Say again, the target number.||CC|P, as in Papa; 17 Delta, D as in Delta. 17 Delta.||CMP|Okay, Papa 17 Delta.||CC|As 30-second intervals.||CC|Okay, Ron. There is a caution note on this. It's a note concerning the frame usage.||||||Tape 76B/3||CMP|Seems to me like Zebra Zebra only has 18 frames, doesn't it?||CC|That's affirm. Do not exceed 18 frames. The balance of mag Zebra Zebra was used for preflight calibration. Do not exceed 18 frames. You can put that down any way you want it.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay. Under rev 17, I've got a note - a similar note, Ron, for rev 17.||CMP|Okay.||CC|The note is, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey. Balance of magazine was used for preflight cal. I'll say again, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey.||CMP|Okay, on mag Whiskey Whiskey don't exceed 40 frames. The balance is already on calibration.||CC|That's affirmative. And I've got three notes then, Ron, just general notes - may come up in the crew film area. Mag Papa Papa for crew option. Just use mag Papa Papa for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. The last one is save all the remaining VHBW on Quebec Quebec and Romeo Romeo for scheduled photos. We have a very small margin on each.||CC|... end of update.||CMP|That was - Okay, save all remaining on Quebec Quebec. And what was the other one, Jack?||CC|Romeo Romeo.||CMP|Okay, no extras on those two, then - on the VHBW, huh?||CC|Yes, we got a very small margin on those now. And, you're about 10 minutes prior to landing site orbital. Why don't you go over and start studying that, if you want?||||Tape 76B/4|||04 18 03 20|CMP|Okay.|04 18 11 52|CMP|You know you look at - next to Macrobius A, there is a lind of a dark halo-type crater there. Very small one. And it doesn't have the appearance of a hummocky crater rim to it, at all. It looks like the material just kind of spreads out all over the area, but it doesn't have a hummocky appearance to it. I'm going to take a look at that again when I come back - on back around on the other side. There's a small mound down in the bottom of the crater, also. It's a domicalshaped structure in the bottom of that small crater. It's right next to J3. North of J3.||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|Coming in, I can see the landing site, now -quite well. The appearance of the slide area definitely shows up. The South Massif seems to have the Sun shining right on the walls. I'm looking for any type of layering, or anything like that. And can't see anything that - that would show that up. The big difference between the massif structures and the Sculptured Hills is that the massifs look like they are a steeper slope. And they - they don't seem to have that type of covering over them, like the Sculptured Hills do.||CMP|I'm right over now. The scarp definitely cuts up through the North Massif. I can't see continuation on into the South Massif at all. But, you can definitely see a vertical exaggeration as it cuts on around up over the North Massif. And it's almost - I'd have to take another look at it for sure, but it almost looks like a flow coming from Family or in the vicinity - in the direction of Family Mountain - but from the direction of Family Mountain - lapping up on the side of the North Massif. That's the way it looks as you go on by it. I couldn't see anything that would lead you to believe that the slide area, so to speak, would come on across anything that would be the source||||||Tape T6B/5|||of that slide area. I still think I can see the -one spot that has a lighter albedo than the surrounding area there in the Pentagon complex. And it's pretty close to the - Let me get my chart out here and take a look at it again.|04 18 16 50|CMP|No, it still looks like that area that's blown away there is Dog November - between Dog November and Dog Papa. And about 83.4 or something like that.|04 18 IT OT|CC|Copy.||CMP|Yes, just like the map shows, and all the pictures, you've got a definite demarcation in the annulus around Serenitatis here, as you look by Sulpicius Gallus area. As you look at it - I'm going to have to take another check on it - but the dark annulus looks to me like it's raised above the mare, proper, itself. I'll check that a little more as we come on across.||CMP|You know all those rilles to the north of - I mean to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. There is a bunch of crisscrossing. One is right on the edge of the Serenitatis basin - and I don't remember the name of that crater, I'11 have to look it up later - but they've got slightly raised rims around the rilles. You can see some layering down inside the rille itself, in the east-west and the one that runs in the east-west direction.||CC|Roger. You're talking about near Menelaus?||CMP|Yes, I'll have to look on the map and see for sure what the crater is, but there's an impact crater right on the edge of Serenitatis basin -right on the terminator. Right now.||CC|P.oger.||CMP|And then those rilles are just to the north of that crater.||CC|Roger. That's probably Menelaus - M-e-n-e-l-a-u-s -Menelaus.||||Tape 76B/6||||CMP|I think it is.||CC|Okay, Ron. Is The PAN CAMERA, OFF? T-stop time. PAN CAMERA to STANDBY. T-stop time.||CMP|Okay. Is it now?||CC|Roger. You're just a little bit past it.||CMP|Oh, okay, thank you. (Chuckle) Okay, PAN CAMERA -STANDBY. Thank you. That's the first chance I had to look at the Moon, you know. These guys - -||CC|Roger.||CMP|#NAME?||CC|That's all right. We don't mind calling you, if you don't mind getting the call.||CMP|(Chuckle) No, not in the least.||CC|Ron, I'll give you a cue here shortly for PAN CAMERA - OFF. I just want you to know, we will not be retracting the mapping camera; and, therefore, we will not be closing the mapping camera, laser altimeter cover. But we will be dumping normally. Over.||CMP|Okay. We're going to dump with the mapper open, is what you're saying, huh?||CC|That * s aff innative.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|You know it looks to me like it all disappears anyhow. It just kind of leaves the spacecraft. I don't think anything comes around or even sticks around.||CC|Roger, Ron.|04 18 22 03|CC|At your convenience, HIGH GAIN to AUTO.||CMP|You have HIGH GAIN to AUTO.||||||Tape 76B/7||CC|Thank you, sir.||CMP|Okay, it's orbital science photos coming up here. Do you want to use magazine KK still? Or should we finish up Oscar Oscar?||CC|Stand by, Ron. Checking with Tommy on that one.||CC|Ron, they'd like you to use mag KK on that.||CMP|Okay.||CC|While you're looking at the Flight Plan there, at 117'-20 where that mapping camera stuff - just delete mapping camera, retract; and mapping camera, laser altimeter cover, closed at 117:15-||CMP|Okay. Delete mapping camera, retract; arid mapping camera, laser altimeter, closed. Okay.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Okay, magazine KK is starting with 21 pictures.||CC|Roger. We copy.||CMP|Okay. Bob, if - would you give me a call when you get ready for that mapping camera stuff? I was kind of shoved off this morning, and I got to sample their buses.||CC|Yes. Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call - first one will probably be a pan camera call here shortly, and then I'll call you when it's time for those purge line heaters - things like that.|04 18 26 20|CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay, Ron, PAN CAMERA POWER to OFF.|04 18 28 22|CMP|Okay, PAR CAMERA POWER - Let's see. PAN CAMERA POWER is OFF.||CC|Thank you, sir.||CMP|Good.||||Tape 76B/8||||CMP|Hey, this is not so bad, if you think of iced tea, I guess.||CC|Roger.||CC|Just for your information, Ron. Gene's out on the surface right now.||CMP|Oh, they are? Hey, great I||CMP|Did they confirm my position yet?||CC|I don't - Let me check here - I don't think we have it pinned down exactly. You're pretty darn close to it. That's for sure.|04 18 32 25|CMP|You know, it's funny. It wasn't as bright - That pass over - This last pass - as it was the time before.|04 18 4l 05|CC|I hope you haven't - I hope you haven't spilled any; and, by the way, LMP is on the surface now, too.||CC|America, Houston. You can go with the HO PURGE HEATERS now.||CC|America, Houston.||CMP|Houston, America. Go ahead.||CC|Roger. You can go with the H2 PURGE LINE HEATERS and the rest of that Flight Plan.||CMP|Okay. What do you know? The PURGE LINE HEATERS have been ON.||CC|Roger. We kind of suspected that.||CMP|Okay. (Laughter) Okay. Let's see. MAPPING CAMERA can come OFF. Thirty seconds.|04 18 45 31|CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA is going to STANDBY. IM PITCH MOTION is OFF. Altimeter - LASER ALTIMETER -is OFF. UV is OFF. IR is OFF. Okay, UV cover -box. UV COVER is CLOSED; barber pole, gray. IR COVER is CLOSED; barber pole, gray. Okay, MAP CAMERA LASER ALTIMETER - we'll leave that one OPEN.||||||Tape T6B/9||CC|Good show, Ron.||CMP|Okay. Then it's my understanding you don't want to do any dumping until I go on the back side of the Moon. Is that correct?||CC|That's affirm, Ron.||CMP|Okay.||CC|According to the Flight Plan, you do it at 117:50. Right about that time.||CMP|Okay. Will do.|04 18 48 23|CMP|Bob, one little notice. Supplies I had this morning. Might made notes, so I wouldn't forget about it. It was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes a heck of a long time to vent that tunnel. In the simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and it flips right down and vents. And I was beginning to wonder if it - if it was leaking or something.||CC|Roger.||CMP|As it turned out, as it turns out, it worked out all right. But I bet it took a good 10 minutes, -to get up to 3.5. Before I could turn the jets back on, you know.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Go, that's ready to go.||CC|Ron, just one reminder as we go around the horn here. The waste water - the way - the position it is in will probably take between 10 and 12 minutes to dump it completely. Or dump it to your .10 percent number.||CMP|Okay, that's good. Oh, glad I don't have anybody watching for me this time. Do I?||CC|Yes, that's right. We won't be able to call you on that. When it's down to 8 percent.||||Tape 76B/10||||CMP|(Laughter) Okay, I'll put my old timer on.||CC|Hey, Ron, one other reminder. We know it's in the Flight Plan, but you may get real busy just prior to that orbital science photos. And EECOM would like to make sure you get the H purge line heaters off, as scheduled, at 118:02.||CMP|Okay. Okay, is she in there? Yes - it's in the Flight Plan. Okay.|04 18 53 21|CC|Roger; it's in the Flight Plan. But it's just before you're going to get busy on that orbital science photo. You might of - you might go to the window earlier or something.||CMP|Okay. It's a good point.||CC|And your friends out on the surface have the Rover out now and - starting to load it up and getting ready to check it out.||CMP|Hey, great 1||CC|The surface work is going really good. They're just a little bit behind the time line from their suiting-up exercise. But it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.||CMP|Uhuh. Uhuh. 250 lens on that thing.|04 18 58 19|CC|Ron, you're 5 minutes to LOS here. And you're looking real good all around the room. No problems with any of the systems that we can see. We'll see it at 118:29. And we'll be with you for another 5 minutes here.||CMP|118:29, okay. Okay, we're going to have a little grape drink.||CC|Just remember what Jan says. Don't spill it on your flight suit.||CMP|(Laughter) Right.||||||Tape 76B/11||CMP|Did I miss lunch? Or wasn't I supposed to get any lunch today?||CC|I don't know, that wasn't on my shift. But if you're hungry, why don't you eat something?||CMP|(Laughter) That's what I'm doing.||CC|It's been a long time since lunch - -||CMP|I'm nibbling.||CMP|Yes. Long time since breakfast, I think, wasn't it?||CC|Yes, I think it was. And you got about 4 more hours until scheduled eat time. So - you got some lunar sounder work there - and about 119 or so, so you might as well consider eating a lot.||CMP|Yes, I could eat dinner. I'm kind of nibbling a little bit.||CC|Just want to make sure you don't lose your scissors, too.||CMP|Yes. This time I got them snapped to the hand controller and stuck in the little thing around it. I don't know how I've lost those things.||CC|Roger.||CMP|I didn't like that big string on there all the time. I didn't like that big string getting all over the place. So I rolled the string on the strap, and stuck the scissors in that little bungee that's on the hand controller. I woke up the next morning and they're gone. I still think it's behind the optics.||CC|Just don't go look at them; okay? We'll find them pre - postflight. Okay?||CMP|Okay.||||Tape 76B/12||||CC|Hey, Ron. I don't know what Tommy has against you, but they just never scheduled an eat period in here. We checked this out so thoroughly that, we forgot to check it to see if there was an eat period in there.||CMP|We probably weren't hungry when we checked it out.|04 19 00 5^|CC|Roger.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 77A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|04 17 30 17|LMP-LM|Okay.

I've got to figure out how to open that now.||||||Tape 77A/25||CDR-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|When you're at 5 psi, it's - We never did really train for this in the right way.|04 18 24 39|LMP-LM|Yes, we did. Okay. My water is OPEN.|04 18 24 47|CDR-LM|And my water is OPEN.||CDR-LM|Okay. Well, let's see, rest until cooling sufficient; 3*7 to 4.6. I'm to 4.9; coming down.||LMP-LM|Yes, I am, too. Coming down.||CDR-LM|CWEA status.|04 18 25 13|CDR-LM|PREAMPs and ECS. Can you see that?|04 18 25 16|LMP-LM|See a PREAMPs, and I see ECS.|04 18 25 18|CDR-LM|Okay. Water SEP component light, on.|04 18 25 22|LMP-LM|Water, excuse me, water SEP. Well, the next thing it says that Gene gets out.||CDR-LM|I don't see that.||LMP-LM|That's what it says on my checklist.||CDR-LM|Okay. Good heavens! That means you got to get out of the way so I can open the hatch.||LMP-LM|Well, I'm going to have to turn around a little, I think, so I can help you.||CDR-LM|Okay. Boy, beware of that corner.||LMP-LM|It's high pressure (laughter).||CDR-LM|Yes. I tell you at 4-1/2, you're really pretty heavy.||LMP-LM|What was that that came shooting up here? A piece of bread? (Laughter) Would you believe that?||||Tape 77A/26||||CDR-LM|Yes, I'd believe it.||LMP-LM|Why is our hatch open? Somebody opened our hatch. Are you getting cooling?||CDR-LM|I'm beginning to, I think.||LMP-LM|I still got a water flag. Not hot. Stand by. Okay. Well.|04 18 26 39|LMP-LM|How does the water pressures look, Houston?|04 18 26 46|CC|Challenger, they're looking just a little bit low. We're still expecting it to build up. It's going to take a little while.|04 18 26 54|CDR-LM|Okay. I'm getting down on my knees out here. How am I looking, Jack?||LMP-LM|You're just fine. I'm holding you away from the DEDA, the ... DSKY.||CDR-LM|Okay. I'm going to put this visor down now, I think. How does that look to you?||LMP-LM|What?||CDR-LM|How are my legs? Am I getting out?||LMP-LM|Well, I don't know. I can't see your legs.||CDR-LM|Oh, okay (laught er).||LMP-LM|I think you're getting out though, because there's not as much of you in here as there used to be. Oh, hey; Gene, when I get down there, I got to fix your tool harness. Hold it.||CDR-LM|Okay. Can you reach it?||LMP-LM|It's come off the bottom again.||CDR-LM|Can you reach it?||LMP-LM|Well, I can't do it now, because it's come off from the bottom. I'll have to - -||||||Tape 77A/27||CDR-LM|Oh, the bottom of the PLSS, huh?||LMP-LM|Yes.|04 18 07 46|CDR-LM|Okay. Well, my legs are out. Keep that hatch open.||LMP-LM|Can you squat down any further, because you're hooked on - you're making it worse. Okay,||CDR-LM|How's that?||LMP-LM|Okay. Now, I think I - Be careful because you might hook it on something down there.||CDR-LM|Oh, the tool harness?||LMP-LM|Yes. The back. It's loose on your back; on the back of the PLSS.||CDR-LM|Oh, man, I don't like that. Okay. I'll watch it||LMP-LM|Well, I'11 fix it when I get out there.|04 18 28 21|CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm still reading 4.0. Houston, Commander is on the porch of Challenger.|04 18 28 30|CC|Roger. We copy you, Commander, and your feed water pressure is looking much better - -||CDR-EVA|||CC|- - now, and you're probably getting cooling.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Everything else look good to you?||CC|That's affirmative.|04 18 28 46|CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack. I'm going to get the MESA.||LMP-LM|Okay. And I'll have an ETB ready for you.||CDR-EVA|Oh, man; oh, man; oh, man.||LMP-LM|Deploy MESA.|04 18 29 00|CDR-EVA|Okay. Here it comes.||||Tape 77A/28|||04 18 29 08|CDR-EVA|There she goes, Babe.||LMP-LM|Yea, hey!||CDR-EVA|There she is. All the way down; it looks like. Okay. I jettisoned - Oh, you want an ETB?||LMP-LM|That's up to you.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-LM|You're the commander.||CDR-EVA|I got it. I got it. And, the pressure looks like it's started to stabilize at 3.8. I don't know whether I'm getting cooler or not, but I feel pretty good.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP-LM|How about a jett bag, too?||CDR-EVA|Okay. Oh, Jack, I could swing it over the - Won't be any problem. Over the strut. Okay; and the jet bag is springing free - swinging free.||LMP-LM|You mean the ETB.||CDR-EVA|ETB. Oh, man. This looks like a Santa Claus bag.||LMP-LM|It is.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy. There it goes. The Rover looks in good shape. ETB is down there. Okay. I've got all my visors down. Jack, I wouldn't lower your gold visor until after you get on the porch, because it's plenty dark out here.||LMP-LM|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-LM|Tape recorder - -|04 18 30 43|CDR-EVA|I'm on my way.||||||Tape 77A/29||LMP-LM|#NAME?||CDR-EVA|Sensitivity, max and max.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Houston, The Commander Is about three-quarters of the way down.|04 18 31 09|CDR-EVA|I'm on the footpad. And, Houston, as I step off at the surface at Taurus-Littrow, I'd like to dedicate the first step of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible. Jack, I'm out here. Oh, my golly. Unbelievable. Unbelievable, but is it bright in the Sun. Okay. We landed in a very shallow depression. That's why we've got a slight pitch-up angle. Very shallow, dinner-plate-like dish crater just about the width of the struts. How you doing, Jack?|04 18 32 12|LMP-LM|Fine. Getting the circuit breakers verified.||CDR-EVA|The LM looks beautiful. Oh, do we have boulder tracks coining down. Let me see exactly where we are. I think I may be just in front of Punk.|04 18 32 45|CC|Okay. We copy that, Gene, and are the boulder tracks - -||CDR-EVA|I'm beginning to - -||CC|#NAME?|04 18 32 53|CDR-EVA|Okay. On the North Massif, we've got very obvious boulder tracks. A couple of large boulders come within 20 or 30 feet of the - Looks like where we can get to them, but there's a couple -there's a couple I know we can get to. Well, the Sun angle is such that, what I saw on the South Massif earlier I can't see very well. But, I know there were boulder tracks over there. The -Bare Mountain - Boy, it's hard to look to the east - Bare Mountain and the Sculptured Hills have a very, very similar texture on the surface. The Sculptured Hills is like the wrinkled skin of an old,sold, 100-year-old man - is probably the best way I could put it. Very, very hummocky, and -but smoothly pockmarked. I do not see any boulders up by the Sculptured Hills from here. But it's awful hard to look to the east and to the southeast||||Tape 77A/30||||CC|Okay. We copy that, Gene. Have you got an LMP with you yet?|04 18 34 09|CDR-EVA|Well, here come his feet. Jack, let me make sure. We didn't have an awful lot of dust on landing; but I can dig my foot in 8 or 10 inches, and I know we're at least that thick. There's a small little 1-meter crater right in front of us with a whole mess of glass right in the middle. That's right in front of the MESA, as a matter of fact. Right where I want to park the Rover. Jack, you're looking good.||CC|Beautiful, guys; beautiful.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to take a quick look back. I think this is Poppy, and I can give you a real better idea where we are.||LMP-LM|Hatch is closed, barely.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack, don't lock it.||LMP-LM|I'm not going to lock it.||CDR-EVA|We've got to go back there. You lose the key, and we're in trouble.|04 18 35 01|LMP-EVA|Oh, I'm on the porch. Who said this place was smooth?||CDR-EVA|Boy, there's a lot of local depressions here I didn't figure existed.|04 18 35 IT|LMP-EVA|Hey, who's been tracking up my lunar surface?||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, I'm east of the LM now. I'm east of the LM, and the back strut of the LM is - Well, the LM straddles this crater I talked about, and that's where we get the pitch angle; the back strut is probably right down in the eastern one-third of that crater. Just a little - very subtle crater.||LMP-EVA|Hey, man; you had some forward velocity.||CDR-EVA|That's what I wanted to have.||||||Tape 77A/31||CDR-EVA|Boy, I look at some of these rocks that are filleted here, Jack, and there sure are a lot of sparklies in them. Awful lot of sparklies.||LMP-EVA|You landed in a crater!||CDR-EVA|That's a pretty good shot.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to get to work in a minute, just as soon as I take a look at Trident.||LMP-EVA|Why don't you come over here and let me deploy your antenna.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Just walk around for 1 second.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Hey, man, put your visor down.||CDR-EVA|And, I'll be over there, and you can fix my tool harness. I don't like that thing loose.||LMP-EVA|I don't like it loose, either. What are you doing over there? We're supposed to be working.|04 18 36 39|CDR-EVA|I was just going to give them a fix. All these little craters, Jack, have got glass in the bottom of them. Here's another one.||LMP-EVA|There's very clear sweeping of the surface by the descent plume out, oh, about 10 meters -no, 15 meters. Come over here, and I'll fix your antenna.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Hey, Bob, how big is Poppy supposed to be?||CC|Stand by. It looks on the map - -||CDR-EVA|I didn't hear you. You cut out.||CC|Okay. It looks on the map like it's about 75 meters in diameter. Fairly subtle.|04 18 37 28|CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay, I tell you where I think I landed -oh, about 100 meters from Poppy at 10 o'clock.||LMP-EVA|You think that's Poppy, huh?||||Tape 77A/32||||CDR-EVA|I think so - I think - -||LMP-EVA|That's an awful big hole.||CDR-EVA|Well, I know. I got to look axound a little more. It sure is not Trident.||LMP-EVA|Bend over and I'll - -||CDR-EVA|It might be part of Trident.||LMP-EVA|- - get your antenna. Get your antenna. Oh, a little more.||CDR-EVA|Gosh, it's beautiful out here.||LMP-EVA|Well, hang on.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay. The immediate surf - -||LMP-EVA|Not yet. Yes, go - you talk to them. I don't want you to stand up yet.||CDR-EVA|The surface is moderately cohesive, which holds a pretty good bootprint - very fine grain. ... looks very much like previous soils. You got her?||LMP-EVA|Yes. You got a hole behind you now.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll stand in it, and you can get at it better.||LMP-EVA|Well, you got me right in the Sun. Can you come around this way? Ho-ho. (Laughter) I'm going to have to get upstream of you.||CDR-EVA|Look, you get up on the hill, and I'll get in the hole.||LMP-EVA|Yes. There you go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.||CDR-EVA|Don't move too fast. Boy, your feet look like you just walked on the Moon, you know.||||||Tape 77A/33||LMP-EVA|Well, I tell you Gene, I think the next generation ought to accept this as a challenge.||LMP-EVA|Let's see them leave footsteps like these someday. Got another - there, that'll be all right.|04 18 39 12|CDR-EVA|Okay. What did you do with my tool harness?||LMP-EVA|I'm going to work on it; that's what I'm going to do. Whoa; hold still.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Boy, I tell you, looking to the east, you might just well forget it.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's see. How's this thing - I'm going to have to loosen it.||CDR-EVA|Well, if you could just stretch it around.||LMP-EVA|I can't.||CDR-EVA|You can't huh?||LMP-EVA|But I will be in a minute.||CDR-EVA|Don't loosen it to the point where you can't get it back on.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You're almost reconfigured.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Somebody tied you on wrong, too. They've got the strap reversed for the Velcro. Okay, Gene. I think that will hold.||CDR-EVA|Okay, and I'm going to - -||LMP-EVA|If it doesn't I'll fix you again.|04 18 40 20|CDR-EVA|Man, there's sparklies in the soil, Jack. You can just look at it. See them all over? Very fine grained. It's sparkly, that's all. Bob, I'm going to min cooling - or, intermediate cooling.|04 18 40 33|CC|Okay. Copy that.||||Tape 77A/34||||LMP-EVA|Boy, that sure -||CDR-EVA|See the soil sparkle?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think that's a little glass.||CDR-EVA|There's - Let's go back here and get to work, and I'll show you that crater that's got nothing but glass in the bottom.||LMP-EVA|That's a vesicular rock of some kind there, Geno. It almost looks like a mono crater - pumice, but don't quote me.|04 18 ki 01|CDR-EVA|Bob, I have to reiterate. Even the small - even the very small - the 1- and 2-inch - 3-inch fragments that are laying around here have been dusted and filleted - -||LMP-EVA|Do-tu-doo.||CDR-EVA|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|And that sweeping by the descent stage goes all the way out there, Houston, to where we were, which was about 50 meters, I guess. Hey, man - whuh, whuh, whuh, whuh - these rocks - they almost have a pink - very light pinkish hue to them, and they are not - they're not obviously breccia. Now, that - that's a - like a breccia there. But this stuff is something else again.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I don't think there is any place you could land around here where you wouldn't have one foot, in the crater.||LMP-EVA|Looks like a vesicular, very light-colored porphyry of some kind; it's about 10 or 15 percent vesicles. I'm right in front of the LM. They - Quite a few of the rocks look of that type. Sort of a pinkish hue to them. The texture is coarse, but I'm not sure how crystalline they are, yet. Okay; back to work.||CDR-EVA|Jack, when you put up the ETB, the - check down there below it.||||||Tape 77A/35||LMP-EVA|Oh-ho-ho (laught er).|04 18 42 33|CDR-EVA|Okay, let's take a look at the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Let's don't forget those.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|That's my fault; I guess.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh man, I tell you, we came down at just a little forward velocity. Look at that - right there. About a foot slip on the pad. I tell you, there's craters all over here. Okay, baby. I'd sure like to think that that wheel is where it's supposed to be. It looks good to me.|04 18 43 06|CDR-EVA|Our next little vehicle to work.|04 18 43 35|CDR-EVA|Okay. Bob, so far, the Rover looks pretty good.|04 18 43 39|CC|Roger; sounds good, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Hey, let me ask you. When I was behind the LM, I could look right into an area and see the bell of the ascent stage. I never realized that before, but I guess that's normal, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes. We saw it on the pad. Remember.||CDR-EVA|Barely.||LMP-EVA|Remember when we went out there?||CDR-EVA|The only reason I asked, Bob, I'm sure it's normal, and it doesn't look anything's missing, it's just right - right into the Sun.||CC|Yes. The consensus of opinion down here is that you can, also.||||Tape 77A/36||||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's probably the best place in the world to get a consensus of opinion from. Okay, Jack, it's about work time. I've got this Rover about ready for - your pull up there.||LMP-EVA|I got a little delayed here.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm sure glad those guys made us train so hard.||LMP-EVA|Okay. The MESA's up. Let me know when you're ready to deploy.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Babe, I am - I am ready for you. Everything I can see looks pretty good. The walking hinges, you will be glad to know, are intact. They did not drop.|04 18 45 12|CC|Roger. That's a first.||LMP-EVA|You want me to go up there and do that, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. The beginning.||LMP-EVA|You ready for me to deploy?||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me just doublecheck. Drape, contingency, unstow aft deployment cable, verify walking hinge, forward and aft chassis parallel. They are.||LMP-EVA|MESA insulation is not coming off as easy as in training.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Outrigger cables are taut. Looking good to me. Yes, Jack. You can go on up. Go on up.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I'm ready for you. Gosh, that LM is a pretty sight. Challenger, you're a beauty.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's see how good I am.||CDR-EVA|Don't drop that. Let me get that thing again.||||||Tape 77A/37||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. (Laughter) Yes, sir. You're pretty agile there, twinkle toes.||LMP-EVA|You bet your - life I am.||CDR-EVA|All I asked you to do was pull that handle up there. Man, anything you grab, Jack - I just grabbed this lanyard that was in the dust - is really black.||LMP-EVA|You ready?|04 18 46 29|CDR-EVA|Go. She fell, Houston. She's open.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You've got parallel chassis; the wheels look good on this side.||CDR-EVA|Okay. They're good on this side. Let's get done. Let's get it out.||CDR-EVA|I'll wait for you to get the deploy cable. I'll tell you, Jack, this place is not locally level.||LMP-EVA|You - you're right.||CDR-EVA|Okay. There's not - there's not many places you could put the LM down and have it be zero, zero, zero. Okay. I'm ready if you are.||LMP-EVA|I don't know how much help I'm going to be.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'm starting; you pull. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming, baby. How's your wheels on that side? Can you see them: Mine look good.||LMP-EVA|Wheels; they looked good a minute ago. I got the Sun, so I can't tell much - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Eeee. The only way to do it.||LMP-EVA|I'm putting all my weight (laughter).||CDR-EVA|Okay. Wait a minute. I'm coming down now. She's going to pop here.||||Tape 77A/38||||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute. Stand by.||LMP-EVA|I may pull a Jim Irwin here.||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute. Watch out. Here she goes.||LMP-EVA|Got her.|04 18 47 52|CDR-EVA|Okay. Beautiful, Houston. The aft chassis's out.|04 18 47 57|CC|Roger. Beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Beautiful. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.||LMP-EVA|Tried to get off the hinge there.||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes. She's on, though. She's all in. She's in the walking hinges. I wish you could see it. Jack, those wheels did not lock all the way up though. We ought to pull them up before we -well - -||LMP-EVA|||CDR-EVA|Well, there it goes by itself. Okay. Wait a minute - wait a minute. Okay. Let me pull it until the outriggers cables get slack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Walk away from it. Easier.||CDR-EVA|That tape up there - on the reel.||LMP-EVA|Yeah, it's all -||CDR-EVA|It's coming.||LMP-EVA|It's free reeling.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Let me - let me - don't pull it until I -Okay. Now I've got it.||CDR-EVA|Man, I'd walk and fall into that crater if I went to the end of this line.||||||Tape 77A/39|04 18 48 59|LMP-EVA|Houston, I do think we've got a different -||CDR-EVA|Well, we're deploying it at an angle. Okay. The outrigger cables are free, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Got a different breed of rock up here. The stuff's sticking through this thin regolith - or regolith, period. I don't know whether it's thin or thick yet (singing). Okay. Mine's free.||CDR-EVA|Let me get this - let me get all this cable out of the way. Otherwise, I'll - is that enough of this stuff? I don't like all that over there. ...||LMP-EVA|A geologist's paradise, if I ever saw one. Boy, you certainly are changing the color of that cable, sir.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Just tried a John Young trick.||LMP-EVA|Did it work?||CDR-EVA|Yes. (Laughter).||LMP-EVA|You're getting dirty.||CDR-EVA|But, I'm still getting my balance. I didn't touch the ground. Just got to get some of this cable out of here.||LMP-EVA|I'm not sure my pockets are going to be accessible.||CDR-EVA|Man, I'll tell you, I don't know how long this line to pull the Rover out is, but -||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll tell you, it sure is easy to get dusty, but that's nothing new to anybody. Okay, Babe, let me get - Wheel|04 18 50 32|LMP-EVA|I think it's safe to say this surface was not formed yesterday. There is a regolith; it looks classic. Area distribution of particles up to 3 or 4 centimeters, anyway. Then, you start to get maybe a selective distribution of large fragments. Got that cable?||||Tape 77A/40||||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm going to walk away with this one.||CDR-EVA|Okay; outrigger cable.||LMP-EVA|You ready?||CDR-EVA|Okay. When forward wheels on surface; okay. Let me - let me pull.|04 18 51 09|CDR-EVA|Okay, Houston. She's continuing to come.||LMP-EVA|Here's a couple of different looking rocks. One's very white; one's quite dark. But we do have a general rock type, I think, in the area - of the big boulders. Gosh, how much cable is there?||CDR-EVA|There's a lot of it Jack. Keep going.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|You're going to be a long way away. We're not there yet. Keep going. Okay. We've got the front wheels on the surface, but keep going, I don't think you've got it up there.||LMP-EVA|I never thought I'd do geology this way.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I think you got it. Let me see.||LMP-EVA|Is it slack?||CDR-EVA|I'll get up there and take a look. Okay. It's slack.||LMP-EVA|Longest cable in the world.|04 18 52 12|CDR-EVA|It's slack.|04 18 52 15|CC CDR-EVA|Wait till you get to the ALSEP package. Okay. By golly, those wheels did lock.||||||Tape 77A/41||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) I never knew that cable was that long, Bob. Oh, a glass bottom - a glass bottom crater with a little bench. Looks like one of the Flagstaff explosion craters except for the glass in it. Right out at 12 o'clock. That's the one I was talking about, about having a bright halo. I don't know whether it's easier to walk out there or to do what I did in training - that I wouldn't do on the Moon. Somebody's going to get tangled up with this thing.||CDR-EVA|That's why I'd get it all under the LM somewhere. I'd - what I'd - took me 5 minutes to do and get it all out of the way. Okay, Bob, the front wheels locked in. I had to pull the rear wheels -rear wheels back to get them to lock in.|04 18 53 11|CC|Okay. Copy that.|04 18 53 16|CDR-EVA|At least no one let any air out of the tires. Man, I look like I've been on the surface for a week already. Holy smoley. Okay. Pull pins on deploy cable and fittings - move LRV from LM.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute. I haven't ... the - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|- - other pins. It's going to take awhile. Think we can avoid that cable?||CDR-EVA|Why don't you set it there, pull this pin, and then you can go back and get it; that is, it's better to use the Rover contingency tool, because - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, but that's off over there on the ground now, somewhere or another.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Pull that pin. Until we get that saddle loose.|04 18 53 52|LMP-EVA|Loose.||CDR-EVA|Beautiful. Okay, we're going to have to move that thing - that line, Jack. You ready?||||Tape 77A/42||||LMP-EVA|I'll move it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's find a - back over here. See that?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Oh, man.

I'm going to set it right on the floor of the Rover. Jack, let me get that tool. We got to get those pins in, I think.|04 18 55 52|CDR-EVA|Bob, you got any words on the yellow pins on the rear chassis?|04 18 55 55|CC|Roger. The best way to put those in, if you've tried bouncing the chassis, would be to push them with the contingency tool. ... what you're going to do.||LMP-EVA|That's affirm. Can you get that, Geno?||LMP-EVA|Need some help?||CDR-EVA|Nope. Well, 1 found how to get up.||LMP-EVA|Did you fall down?||CDR-EVA|Well, this thing was in the mud down here. We'll find out in a minute.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack. Got an out one here, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Let me try to push it in.|04 18 57 06|CDR-EVA|Okay. Yours is in.||LMP-EVA|Good.||CDR-EVA|Can I get mine in?||||Tape 77A/44||||LMP-EVA|Want me to get it?||CDR-EVA|Well, yes. Can you reach it from there? It's a nice ... on it. Almost. A little more. Wait a minute. Let me get it - let me get it right -Okay; push. It's in. It's in.||LMP-EVA|Very good. Why don't you put that between the s eats ?|04 18 57 39|CDR-EVA|Yes, Okay. Bob, they're in.|04 18 57 40|CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Now where was I? I got my fender, got the post, got to get the seat.||LMP-EVA|Ready?||CDR-EVA|I'm going to take it a little slower here in a minute.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Just a little bit slower in a minute.||LMP-EVA|The blush is off the rose. Okay, your front pin is in. And both of mine are in.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Not quite as easy as in the training building.||CDR-EVA|Well, it's a case of knowing how to play in 1/6 g, is what it amounts to. Okay. Okay. I'm ready on the - the lock?|04 18 58 4i|LMP-EVA|Yes. It's locked.|04 18 58 43|CDR-EVA|Let me get the seat down. Okay.

Okay.||CDR-EVA|Just a little piece. I'm going to leave it right behind your footstool. It just - just sparkled at me. I had to pick it up. Okay?||LMP-EVA|That's yours. Your sample for the day.||CDR-EVA|I doubt that. Man, I tell you, zero g is a piece of cake if you - or 1/6 g, if you'd play it right|04 18 59 45|LMP-EVA|Okay, Gene, you've got - fenders, your pin was good. I checked that. I could see mine, too. Mine are okay, and you'll have to check your outside ones.|04 18 59 57|CDR-EVA|Okay. !Nty two pins are good here.|04 19 00 01|LMP-EVA|Yes.

Nothing showing up on the seismometer anyhow ...||CC|Well, you have to remember on the seismometer, on at least the one for Jack's call, the S-IVB had just clobbered the seismometer, and - and that there was something small impact that when the -it was in the mud, you wouldn't have seen it.||CMP|Oh, okay; sure.||||Tape 77B/6|||04 20 27 58|CC|Ron, I know you're wondering.

We sure hope so.||CMP|(Laughter) Oh, I'm sure it is.||CC|You take another look at Copernicus, or did you eat during the test?||CMP|Just stuck my head out the window. I've got to find it. There it is, right here.||CMP|Oh., boy. Just wasn't quite light adapted there. I'm not sure if you could really tell ... going through there or not.||CC|Roger. Understand.||CMP|You know, light and dark albedos show up real well. You can see some indication of terrain; that is, hilliness or burrows or - or grabens or rilles.

Don't use your glove or dust brush there.||CDR-EVA|Okay; when I was bringing that -||LMP-EVA|No, we'll use the lens brush, Bob.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's try to see if I can read in this Sun now. Rotate the hand controller. Let's wipe it out a couple of times to make sure we got all the the steering. She's wiped out. She goes forward and she goes reverse. She's back in forward; she's wiped out, and she's in park. Reverse is down. Okay, here we go. Stand by for life. It ought to be on this one. There's life in this here baby. Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|I don't know who's responsible for packing this ETB, but I think it was me. You didn't by any chance pick up those scissors, did you?||CDR-EVA|No, sir.||LMP-EVA|They're going to be hard to find, but I think we can do it.||CDR-EVA|Well, they were right down there, unless you picked them up. That's exactly where the Rover tool was, too, and I picked it up, so it's -they're probably there. I didn't see them though. Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay.

I'm going to find out in a minute.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|04 19 07 34|CDR-EVA|Okay. Here we go. Okay. The runt - the fright -the front wheels turn. I can't see the rear ones.||LMP-EVA|I'll verify them in a minute.|04 19 07 50|CDR-EVA|Okay. I can't see the rear ones, but I know the front ones turn. And it does move. Hallelujah! Hallelujah, Houston! Challenger's baby is on the roll.||CC|Roger. Copy that. Sounds great.||CDR-EVA|And judging - judging from the way it's handling, I think the rear wheels are steering too.||CC|That's a first.||CDR-EVA|What do you see, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Well, I - you're wrong angle. Yes, they're turning.||||Tape 78A/4||||CDR-EVA|How does that grab you?||LMP-EVA|They're turning.||CC|How about that?||LMP-EVA|Come towards me, baby. Looks like it's moving.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy.

Don't worry.||LMP-EVA|Somebody said it was going to be just behind the south end. (Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to take a little spin around here, and I'll meet you at the front end.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Boy, there's a lot of static, though, everytime I. start driving.|04 19 10 09|LMP-EVA|I know what that was over there, I think. Let me see. Whee! Okay, Houston. The basic material around the LM is just what I said „ a fine-grained, medium-gray regolith-appearing material that is the||||||Tape 78A/5|||standard area's population. The craters, though, bigger than about a meter in diameter, seem to -get to - rock fragments - which I haven't yet learned how to pick up.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack. I'm going to give them our position here. I think I know exactly where we are now.||LMP-EVA|Well, once you get them dirty, just like the boys say, it's hard to tell what they are.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Houston. I'm - I'm parked right next to Barjea. And we are, from Barjea, 12 o'clock -Jack, how far - oh, you can't see. You're looking, at the Sun. I guess about 150 meters due west of Barjea. And that's why we looked so close to Trident. I'm coming right up on Poppy. No question about where I am now. I've got Trident, and when I get up there - We are abeam of Trident 1, just where I said we were. I'm right at Poppy. We're about - oh, 100 meters just about due - due west of Poppy, which is almost in line with Barjea, of course, but basically, on that line, I think, between Rudolph and Trident 1. And, as I look at it in the cross section, about 100 meters - about 100 meters north of Trident 1. That's the landing point.||CDR-EVA|Sure get dirty fast. Jack, that is Trident right here that I - that we walked over to. (Laughing) I just got iny first initiation to getting very dirty.||LMP-EVA|You sure did (laughter). Where are you? Are you ready to go?||CDR-EVA|I'm coming right around the front now. Houston, did you get that position?||CC|Roger. We copied that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|And Bob, I'm - I'm - I'm very firm of that now. I'm almost positive, unless I'm awfully mistaken about Trident. I don't see how I could be from here. At the sacrifice of my cleanliness, Houston, the basic bright-colored rock type in the area lQoks very much like a cristobalite gabbros of||||Tape 78A/6|||||the - I didn't see cristobalite, but it looks like the gabbros in the mare basalt sweep. The coarsegrained clinopyroxene plagioclase rocks.||CC|Okay. We have that.|04 19 13 50|CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm going to park - How about along side -Am I gonna screw up that little crater with glass in it if I park there?||LMP-EVA|Well, we will eventually.||CDR-EVA|Well, there's that one anyway. Let me park right here.||LMP-EVA|I'm sure we'll find some more.||CDR-EVA|Yes - Jack, where you been?||LMP-EVA|I fell down.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's about close enough. Isn't it.||MP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, she is locked.||LMP-EVA|Here, let me get the 15-volt ...||CDR-EVA|I think this camera is probably a little dirty on the lens. Okay, Houston. We 1re parked. No. The lens is okay. When you uncover one of those lens brushes, I want to use it on my visor. Oh, boy.||CDR-EVA|It just takes a little getting used to the l/6g, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I want to put this camera over here right now, because it's pretty dirty to put back in that bag. Okay, get to work.|04 19 14 54|CC|Roger. We copy that guys. You're about 7 minutes behind right now.||CDR-EVA|LRV front configure. Whoops. Hold it. Hold it.||||||Tape 78A/7||CDR-EVA|What? Okay, we'll catch up.||LMP-EVA|I haven't quite learned how to pick up rocks in my hands yet, Bob, or I would of had you a sample. That's why I fell down. My day will come (singing). Oh, oh! It's an old blue traverse gravimeter.||CDR-EVA|Okay. On the plains of Taurus-Littrow. What a valley. I'd like to cut down here, through here, with a P-38 sometime.||LMP-EVA|That'11 be the day.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it will.||LMP-EVA|Whoa there.||CDR-EVA|You never know.||LMP-EVA|Friend of mine - -||CDR-EVA|Install LCRU, lock posts; I'll get that. Okay. That's the next big hooker, the LCRU.||LMP-EVA|Okay, geopallet's off the IM.||CC|Copy that,||CDR-EVA|You know, you just got to take it easy until you learn to work in l/6g.||LMP-EVA|Well, I haven't learned to pick up rocks, which is a very embarrassing thing for a geologist.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I look like an elephant stumbling around here.||CDR-EVA|Careful with the LCRU. One dust cover came off. Careful with this baby. That's the real one.||LMP-EVA|Boy, you sure move that Rover around when you do that.||LMP-EVA|Hey, the geopallet is locked on.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I'm getting pretty good at throwing things -already.||||Tape 78A/8||||CDR-EVA|Man, that thing won't want to go on.

Did you see that?||LMP-EVA|I wish you'd be more careful.||CDR-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|No, no, no! Not the television camera! (Laughter)||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|It's warm out here, you know?||LMP-EVA|I'm certainly glad I got cool.||CDR-EVA|Okay, the TCU is locked in.|04 09 19 34|LMP-EVA|Houston, I've seen an awful lot of rocks, as I worked here. They look just like those pyroxene gabbros that I mentioned. The pyroxene's irri-descent in the bright sun. The grain size is about - oh, between - Maybe the mean is 2 millimeters with max maybe up at 3 or 4. And it looks like predominantly a pyroxene plagioclase rock -clinopyroxene, but I haven't looked at it real closely.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack. I set the rake on the - -||LMP-EVA|Beautiful.||||||Tape 78A/9||CDR-EVA|- - on the seat. I just haven't learned -I'm getting more finesse now. I think you can overwork yourself, instead of making use of the l/6g.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|It's going to take a whole EVA to get familiar.||LMP-EVA|Well, I hope it doesn't.||CDR-EVA|I find I'm using my arms almost as much as I ever did. I remember the last time I was on the Moon -about 2 hours ago.||LMP-EVA|Okay, guess what? That old hammer goes to the gate top. The blue-handled hammer. What more could you want?|04 19 21 09|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'm getting a low gain out now.||CC|Okay. Copy on that.||LMP-EVA|... live the Rover, huh, Geno?||CDR-EVA|Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|I just couldn't feel it murmur when I pressed the breakers in. I could feel life in it, but - -||CDR-EVA|Hey, you let me down, sport. You let me down. There's a pin you didn't pull.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll let you get that; keep you honest.||LMP-EVA|Not only keep me honest. There, Okay. Where am I? Okay. Gnomon's an island. Actually, up here, it's a geometric reference for photogramat -grat - photogrammetry.||CDR-EVA|Would you believe that the doggone antenna - here -Jack. When I bend this, pull the -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Pull the antenna.||LMP-EVA|Rather awkward.||||Tape 78A/10||||CDR-EVA|Pull the - pull the antenna. I got to open it up to get it out.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Big connector, you know.||CDR-EVA|Yes, connector was wedged in there.||LMP-EVA|Well, that's probably the way it was designed.||CDR-EVA|Boy, don't drop any of those connectors on the - -||LMP-EVA|Look at that go.||CDR-EVA|- - in the dust. We'll never clean them out.||LMP-EVA|(Hum.)||CDR-EVA|Good thing we're well coordinated human beings.||LMP-EVA|Man, I can't believe - yes I can.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's see. Do it right now.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I can.||CDR-EVA|See that?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Which way are you going to put it on?||LMP-EVA|Well, I thought maybe I would put it on that way, so I will put it on this way, because that's probably right.||CDR-EVA|If you put it on right, you're going to disappoint me,||LMP-EVA|Oh, I hate to touch - touch the old gnomon. I'll do my best to please.||CDR-EVA|Very bad general - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob the low gain is - -||CDR-EVA|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|#NAME?||||||Tape 78A/11||CC|Okay. We copy the low gain hooked up.||LMP-EVA|(Hum.) The rake - the rake is on the extension handle.||CC|Roger, 17.||LMP-EVA|My king - my kingdom for a scoop.||CDR-EVA|The scoop is on the extension handle. Different extension handle's of course.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead Bob. Were you calling?|ou 19 24 56|CC|Roger. And your exuberance is showing up on the BTUs. You're running a little high on those.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Exuberance! I've never been calmer in my life ...||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's get - we'll take it easy, Bob. I think it's a great deal a part to just get accustomed to handling yourself in zero gravity, the only vice on the Moon.||CC|Roger. I thought you were at l/6g.||CDR-EVA|Yes. You know where we are, whatever.||LMP-EVA|Okay, old sample bag -||CDR-EVA|Sample containment bag, sample collection bag, or whatever. ... What is this thing called (singing crazy. Come on. Okay, that's there. Some of the simplest things in the world you forget. Okay, let's get this one right this time.||LMP-EVA|You did a great job of parking, so I was standing in a hole.||CDR-EVA|Don't want to mess up all those good looking craters around here.||LMP-EVA|Oop! Hang on there accessory staff. Accessory staff, huh? Most staffs are accessory I've learned.||||Tape 78A/12|||04 19 26 54.|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob the high gain is up and connected.||CC|Okay. Copy that. Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|And raised.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Cable is to staff. See if I can't get your TV camera.||CC|We're waiting with breathless anticipation.||LMP-EVA|Ah, let's keep them in - -||CDR-EVA|Well, how is my cooling doing? I'd like to stay on intermediate, Bob. I feel pretty comfortable. I'm not cold but I'm pleasant.||LMP-EVA|Pleasant? He thinks he's pleasant?||CC|You're fine, no problem; your option, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I just don't want to run out of consumables about 6 or 7 hours.||LMP-EVA|You're about as - Oh well. Okay. I don't think it makes any difference. You got to use the heat. Matter of fact, that's one of the little known facts of this business, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay, here we go. Coming up. I've got the TV camera in my hand, Bob. Oh man. Hey, Jack, just stop. You owe yourself 30 seconds to look up over the South Massif and look at the Earth.||LMP-EVA|What? The Earth?||CDR-EVA|Just look up there.||LMP-EVA|You seen one Earth, you've seen them all.||CDR-EVA|No you haven't, babe. When you begin to believe tbat. Come on camera, go in there ...||LMP-EVA|I'll look in a minute, Gene. But I tell you, once I start this little operation, if I don't finish it, it never get s done.||||||Tape 78A/13||CDR-EVA|Okay, get in there. Okay, that's in there. That's in there.|04 19 28 39|CDR-EVA|Camera is locked down. Okay, TCU, sunshade the camera and then the cable. Okay, let me get the sunshade.|04 19 28 56|LMP-EVA|That's always more of a job than it ought to be. However, SCB-3 is on the handhold.||CDR-EVA|I think I'm getting smarter about l/6g.||LMP-EVA|That gate works great. Snaps in, snaps closed with the slightest flick of a coordinated wrist. Where is that camera anyway?||CDR-EVA|Oh, it's over here. Oh, boy. I just still barely see the scissors.||LMP-EVA|I ought to get those.||CDR-EVA|Yes, but when we go hungry.||LMP-EVA|I'm not sure I can.||CDR-EVA|Okay, don't. Okay, we'll - we'll get them when we get the tongs out, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|There are some tongs in the Rover, and I'll come over and get them in a minute.||CC|Roger, Challenger. And we refrained from mentioning that to Ron.||CDR-EVA|Tell him - Tell him I hope he's enjoying our scissors. Okay, Bob, the TV is connected to the TCU electrically. The sunshade is on. I've got to deploy the high gain.||LMP-EVA|Okay, now, well let's see how smart you are. That was a pretty good attitude you parked at.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack is the high gain away from my antenna. Can you see?||||Tape 78A/14||||LMP-EVA|Let me turn around. Yes. You're clear.||CDR-EVA|Okay, it's locked. Locked. Now let me see if I can find beautiful big dot up there. I know what I'm going to have to do. I'm going to have to get the, oh, I got it right there. Might be able to peak that but I got that.||LMP-EVA|You hit it, huh?||CDR-EVA|Put my hand over it, so I could see it.||LMP-EVA|Hey, that's an interesting problem. Your seat won't stay up.||CDR-EVA.|How about that piece of Velcro there.||LMP-EVA|That's just what I'm working on there. Great minds think alike. Okay, that goes in there. The trouble is to reach it, I've got to -||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll bet you it says put MAG Bravo.||LMP-EVA|Oh, your's is in a circle.||CDR-EVA|Okay, check LCRU. Deploy LCRU with antenna? Okay. Deploy the LCRU with antenna. Blanket's open 100 percent.||LMP-EVA|Come on, baby, open. Ponna, it goes.||CDR-EVA|Oh, are those mirrors nice. I hope they stay that way for a while.||LMP-EVA|They won't. John and Charlie know exactly what we're talking about. Mark my words.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm going to close the circuit breaker, Bob.|04 19 32 43|CDR-EVA|Okay, circuit breaker is CLOSED.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|POWER switch is INTERNAL. POWER switch is INTERNAL. Okay, let me give you some - some||||||Tape 78A/15|||numbers. AGC is 3 - about 3.4; temp is about 1.8; and power is about 2.1. Okay; POWER to EXTERNAL.||CC|We copy those, Geno.||CC|Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay, POWER is EXTERNAL. MODE SWITCH is going to two FM/TV. Okay. Man, did you peak out at signal strength of 40.||LMP-EVA|I can't see right now, but I think I've still got you right in the center.||CDR-EVA|Okay, POWER switch on to TCU. Okay, it's on to TCU. Okay, AGC and POWER. Yes sir, Bob, I'm verifying at 40. That's a good Navy term, 40 on the AGC.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And the TV is all your's.||CC|Roger. Have you got a power reading there for us , Geno?||CDR-EVA|I hope. Okay, I'll give you a power reading, EXTERNAL, if you want it. I'll give you - TEMP is still about 17 and POWER is about 18 on EXTERNAL.||CC|Hey, we have a picture, 17. We have a picture.||CDR-EVA|You have? Beautiful, babe. It's all your's. I hope it moves now.||CC|It does.||CDR-EVA|I hope it moves. You'll find out - hey, it moves. It's alive.||CC|And.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm going to get SRC 1.||CC|Okay, could we have a EMU check on you fellows when convenient?||||Tape 78A/16||||CDR-EVA|Okay. Commander is 3.8 plus. I'm - I must be 80 percent and no flags and no tones.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, LMP is - LMP is about 80, let me see - 75, about 80 percent, and no flags, no tones. I've got 83 percent.||CC|Okay, copy that. And you've sure got a lot of stuff on the Rover already.||LMP-EVA|Yes, MAG Helen has just gone into the bag - into the seat.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|MAG Cynthia is in there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, SRC is open.||LMP-EVA|Gail is in.||CDR-EVA|Jack, watch these SRCs. I don't like the lock on this cable very well.||LMP-EVA|I never have.||CC|Okay, and Jack. You did get that mag?.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Charlie as well?||LMP-EVA|That's affirm.||CC|Okay. And we did not copy your cuff gage reading down here.||LMP-EVA|Oh, you didn't? Well, maybe that's because I didn't give it to you. 3-9- No wonder that's so much work.||CC|Go ahead. Copy that.|04 19 36 53|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, SRC 1 is - She sure won't stay in the MESA ...||||||Tape 78A/17||LMP-EVA|Let me try that. Okay, that will stay in there||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. It's closed. It sure doesn't seem like it wants to stay there, though. And the organic sample has been sealed.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I guess you believe we're here now, huh?||CC|Now we believe you're here. We see you in person.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Bob, the - Bob, the SRC cover will not stay closed. It just slowly springs up. There's nothing I can seem to do for it. I might be able to set something, a blanket, on top or something.||CC|Okay, stand by on that. We'll get back with you.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm putting - yes, it just flops open. I'm taking SCB 1 to the Tool Gate.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I'll get me a hammer, and I'll give you a gravim-eter reading.||LMP-EVA|No, you won't. Not until you're done. I'll go get the flag there. Guess what? We're here again.||LMP-EVA|The Buddy SLSS is on the Rover. Okay, ETB. Okay, CDR's camera film magazine I had to work on a little bit to get it to work but it's working.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|If I get that camera, you can punch the gravimeter, I think.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Get the camera, and I'll give them a gravimeter reading. Is that all you need? Because I'll go get the flag.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you'd better let that - yes, but why don't when you go - let me get some tongs, too. We need to salvage those - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 78A/18||||LMP-EVA|#NAME?||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let me steady the Rover ...||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob.|04 19 39 08|CDR-EVA|MARK: Gravimeter and the light is flashing.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||LMP-EVA|(Singing) Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie. Where the coyotes howl, and the wind blows free. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, where am I?||LMP-EVA|You're doing a gravimeter, getting the flag. I've got your camera. I'm going to salvage the scissors.||CDR-EVA|Okay, get the scissors, and I'll be putting the flag in. And don't no near the Rover.||LMP-EVA|Don't go near the water. That reminds me of a good book - Boy. I can't go near the Rover.||CDR-EVA|Let me tell you.||LMP-EVA|No, I can't go near the Rover.||CDR-EVA|Why don't you set them - -||LMP-EVA|How about you letting me stick these in your pocket with your - -||CDR-EVA|No. Set them up there. Just set them in there. We'll get them when we come back in.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll tell you what I'm going to do.||CDR-EVA|Just set them inside the - put them in the -||LMP-EVA|I'm going to hang them here on the hook.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's good.||||||Tape 78A/1Q||LMP-EVA|Right there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack. How about the flag right over here in this little mound?||LMP-EVA|Which mound?||CDR-EVA|Well, let me take a look around.||LMP-EVA|How about right up there on that little high point. Right up in here where I'm going.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Of course, your idea of a high point might be different than mine.||LMP-EVA|I meant the North Massif. (Laughter)|04 19 40 58|CDR-EVA|That's probably the best place in the -world for the flag, is right up on the top.||LMP-EVA|Okay, let me come over and help you. How about right - how about right? Well, we'll find out ...||CDR-EVA|Yes. Hey, you're in the edge of the crater though, That's no test.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's all right. Move right over here near your tire tracks.||CDR-EVA|Yes. This is a high point right here.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's good. Right there.||CDR-EVA|Well, that wasn't too good.||LMP-EVA|Okay, let me give it a few whacks. Baloney.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Watch your fingers. Now that wasn't too bad. Want to make sure it stands up. That's getting pretty - I can - I - well - we'll - we can probably - what we could do - I don't know how far we could drill, but we hit something solid with that one.||CDR-EVA|No, it was still going.||LMP-EVA|Yes, but did you ever see a vibrator like that?||||Tape 70A/2O||||CDR-EVA|No, I've never put a flag up on the Moon before.||LMP-EVA|What? Pull that in.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) You'll have to get it down to my level. Tall guys are all alike.||LMP-EVA|Wait, I'm not through.||CDR-EVA|Okay. How about getting it stretched out?||LMP-EVA|I will. I Just can't start forward as fast as I would like to. Hate to touch it, my hands are so dirty.||CDR-EVA|Okay?||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's going to want to curl. Maybe it'll -it sort of looks like it's waving in the breeze.||CDR-EVA|Yes sir. How about right there?||LMP-EVA|Take a couple this way, and we'll take a couple that way. How's that?||CDR-EVA|Oh, I ought to get - let me get over to the other side - you can get the Rover in the background.||LMP-EVA|Yeah, and the LM.||CDR-EVA|It does wave when you do that,||CC|We've got a beautiful picture of you guys up -down there.||CDR-EVA|Let me tell you, Bob. This flag is a beautiful picture. You see that?||LMP-EVA|Okay, you're - it's partially covering the Rover, but I think it's a pretty good shot. How *s that ? Let me get the focus right.||LMP-EVA|I don't know where to put it.||CDR-EVA|There you go. Wait a minute.||LMP-EVA|All right I got you reaching for the flag.||||||Tape 78A/21||CDR-EVA|How's that?||LMP-EVA|That's very good, Gene. Let me get it to stereo.||CDR-EVA|Houston - -||LMP-EVA|That's beautiful.|04 19 43 53|CDR-EVA|It's got to be one of the most proud moments of my life. I guarantee you. Let you get a close in one and we'll trade cameras. Houston, I don't know how many of you are aware of this, but this -this flag has flown in the MOCR since Apollo 11. And we very proudly deploy it on the Moon, to stay for as long as it can, in honor of all those people who have worked so hard to put us here and to put every other crew here and to make the country, United States and mankind, something different than it was.||CC|Roger, 17- And presuming to speak in behalf of some of those that work on the MOCR, we thank you very much.||CDR-EVA|Back right where you were. Step to the right. Right there.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's alright. I'll keep it down.||LMP-EVA|... Get closer. I'm going to get on the other side.||CDR-EVA|Well, I want to get something here.||LMP-EVA|What's that?||CDR-EVA|I want to get the Earth.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Let me get over here.||CDR-EVA|Get around on that side.||LMP-EVA|I don't - I don't think it's going - you're a little close, maybe. Get them both in focus.||CDR-EVA|That might do it. Try that one time, then we'll give up and get to work.||||Tape 7 8A/22||||LMP-EVA|Higher up a little -||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Let me try it again, okay? I don't know, Geno, okay? Let me get over here closer to you. Okay. That might have got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, very good.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Alright, looks good. You think your gravimeter's ready so I can go back there?||CC|Roger, 17* The gravimeter*s ready and a couple of words here. One, I presume you found the scissors, right?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CC|Okay. Two -||CDR-EVA|Not Ron's, we found ours.||CC|Roger. And the second thing is we do want the SRC closed. And if you can partially latch it, I'm not sure tha't easily done, that would be one solution. The other would be to put something on top of it to hold it closed.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'll find something||CC|Okay, copy that. One of the brackets off the MESA would be something, or a rock that's nearby; that1s another possibility.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Gene, what are you going to be up to now?||CDR-EVA|I'm going to go get the - -||LMP-EVA|... pallet?||CDR-EVA|#NAME?|04 19 47 52|LMP-EVA|Okay, why don't - why don't I give the old - the old inspection here bit. And I really ought to have nry camera, shouldn't I?||||||Tape 78A/23||CDR-EVA|I need a - -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CC|Roger. That's affirmative.||CDR-EVA|... on this.||LMP-EVA|What would you just -||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll find something.||LMP-EVA|I'll take the old CDR's camera. Not a bad camera to take.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I'm going to take the old gunny sack her<; and put it over. That'11 hold it down.||CC|I presume you're talking about the big bag, Clene.||CDR-EVA|Yes, the big bag that was on the ladder. That's all it needs. It's just a little bit. There's just enough spring force in it. Okay, Houston. I think you've had all the good words about the LM. We have never flown a better LM. I guess that's safe enough to say. The quads look great. The old steerables are aimed right at you. Rendezvous radar's in good shape. It's parked - looks like parallel to Z. Just about perfectly. There's no visible - I'm on the 3 o'clock position, plus Y. No visible contamination. There's a little bit of discoloration of the plume shield below the thrusters. The engine bell never touched the ground. It's about - 15 centimeters off the ground.||CC|How's that for coming down gentle?||CDR-EVA|That's what you call okay number three wire, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Hey, we never heard what our landing parameters were.||CC|We'11 worry about that later.||CDR-EVA|... now that we're here.||||Tape 78A/24||||LMP-EVA|Oh, but they always - they always give them to us in the simulator. Hey, Bob, judging from what I see on my clock, we're not but about 5 minutes behind.||CC|That agrees more or less with the way we read it.|04 19 50 03|LMP-EVA|Gene had a little forward motion as I think you heard his call. And that shows up in the forward footpad at any rate or did. It looks like he may have hit tail first a little bit. That's embedded to the full pad depth. I see no - By George, Gene, you may have had a first. I think you stroked that thing.||CDR-EVA|I stroked what?||LMP-EVA|The rear - the rear landing gear.||CDR-EVA|Well, we can measure it and find out.||LMP-EVA|I'll take a picture of it.||CDR-EVA|May have stroked it. The Mylar, the lower orange Mylar, is folded a little bit.||CC|Roger. There's word floating around down here about a typical Navy landing, but I'm not sure whether we believe it or not.||LMP-EVA|He caught his tail hook. Say, Bob - -||CC|That's the best way.||LMP-EVA|- - Just behind the LM in that very fresh crater, I picked up an example of the kind of gabbro I was talking about. And I'll stick it in the big bag, except the big bag has disappeared.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I've got to give you a reading, Bob, if you're ready.||CC|Ready.||LMP-EVA|You put the big bag up - -||||||Tape 78A/2S|04 19 50 51|CDR-EVA|670 003 101. That's 670 003 101.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||CDR-EVA|Jack, I put that there to hold the SRC down.||LMP-EVA|That's alright, I just put our sample in it. It's in the bottom of the bag. It's about 8 by 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters. Slightly tabular.||CC|Okay. We copy that. It's in the big bag.||LMP-EVA|Yes sir.||CDR-EVA.|Okay, okay, Bob. A MARK on gravity.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|And the light is flashing.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I've got to tell you, Bob. I haven't done everything there is to do in the Navy, but deploying that flag has got to be the most proud thing I'll ever do in my life. If you could see, and you could see it from where we are, I know you'd feel the same way.||CC|Roger on that, Geno.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|God, he's pretty up there. God, you're pretty up there over the South Massif. Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Hope nobody saw that.||CDR-EVA|Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Oh, they were watching me. (Laughter) Those finks. Okay, you weren't doing anything with this gravimeter on here, I hope.||CDR-EVA|No, its on the deck.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 78A/26||||CC|Okay, you might grab me a ... when you set it on there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Too late. Bob.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I'll get it later.||CC|We'll get it later. No hurry.||CDR-EVA|Okay, now if I can figure how to get this off. You've got to educate us again.||LMP-EVA|We may not remember those.||CDR-EVA|Bob, the sceptre's in hand.||CC|Roger on that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll give you a temperature. Let's see whether it fits. I'll bet it does.||CDR-EVA|Come on. Lock, baby. Okay, it's ON -||CC|Copy that.|04 19 54 24|CDR-EVA|LOCK.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. Here's a temperature for you. Forty degrees.||CC|Say again.||LMP-EVA|40||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Both covers. Okay, number 1 - something over here. Never did figure out what. Okay, Bob, the shade is deployed facing deep space.||CC|Copy. Roger. Understand the cosmic ray.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. The antenna is deployed. It's not on the post yet, but it's deployed.||||||Tape 78A/27||LMP-EVA|Oh, oh, come on. Don't get - don't get all caught on something. That's better, that's better. Okay, Bob. I think - just about got a - the sunside deployed, just as perpendicular to the Sun as I think anybody could do.||CC|Okay. Copy that. Good enough.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I don't have any pictures yet, so you might put that down as something to get later.||CC|Yes, we'll catch that in the PAN with the next EVA or something like that.||LMP-EVA|Man if that - Boy, if that antenna doesn't get some noise from outer space, I don't know what will. If they are out there, and they are I'm sure. They'll see that one. That is even weirder looking out here than it is in the high bay. Hey, Bob, before I leave the ALSEP, remind me to check the cosmic ray. I might hit it here in the process of deployment.||CC|Okay, try not to.||LMP-EVA|I got a little close.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh, I will. Okay, the doors are open, beautifully.||LMP-EVA|I don't know what talent you have for landing in holes, Cernan, but once again I'll be doing all the ALSEP work in the hole.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|Are you saying we should have kept the pulleys there, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Okay. Yes, I need the pulleys.||CDR-EVA|You know, Bob, I've got a little bit of a problem here. I've got the SEP connector on. (Laughter) But it - it - it'll - it'll - it'll slide - slide down in, but the locking cover just won't go over.||||Tape 78A/28||||CC|Roger, Geno. Understand. It slides in far enough, you think it's aligned, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm positive it's aligned. It just - it didn't appear to lock over, well not appear, it just won't lock over. I'm shoving it home. Okay, I got it.||CC|Okay. Copy.||CDR-EVA|I got it. MaJs.es everyone happier.||CC|I'm glad we have the right solution to that one, Gene.||CDR-EVA|The right solution is the fact that you've got a man here doing it.||CC|Laughter.|04 19 58 30|CDR-EVA|Okay. Hey, Bob. The ECS TEMP MONITOR switch is ON.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|There's an easy way and a hard to do everything. Don't know why we don't do it the easy way. Payday. RTG is on the surface.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Central station is ... Gene's little pet job makes these things slide out by themselves almost.||CC|Better thank him next time you see him.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Hey, Jack, you notice there's none of those guys up there holding those hoses as we go around the LM.||LMP-EVA|What do you mean? I saw one just a minute ago.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. You want 4, 5, 6, and 7*||CC|That's affirmative.||CDR-EVA|Okay, 4, 5é 6, and 7- It's coming off.||CC|Roger on that.||||||Tape 78A/29||CDR-EVA|Okay.|04 20 00 36|CDR-EVA|Just took time out for a snack and a little water.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. How's the TV working?||CC|Beautiful - To coin a phrase, it's a panoramic scene of beauty.||LMP-EVA|Come on now, Bob.||CDR-EVA|Say, Bob, what do you think of the terrain?||CC|Looks flat. Looks very flat and smooth.||CDR-EVA|That's why you're an astronomer.||LMP-EVA|That's why you're - (laughter). Oh, well.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll give you a reading on the TGE if you're ready.||CC|Roger, ready.||CDR-EVA|Don't kick dust on it. Hope I can read it down here. Okay. Okay, Bob. Bob, you're going to have to bear with me. When I leaned over to punch it, I hit GRAVITY instead of READ, so I guess I got to wait it out.||CC|Okay. We'll set the timer again.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll - I should have been more - more careful. Okay. Orient pallet to the Sun. If you can see it, it's directly at the Sun so that ought to be good.||CC|Okay, copy that.||CDR-EVA|The SRC doesn't have to be all the way closed does it?||CC|No, Not all the way. Just as long as it'y most of the way closed. You can have a crack there in the top.||||Tape 78A/30||||CDR|Okay, that's what it is. Man, I'll tell you. This - this thing got low all of a sudden. How are you coming, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Great.||CDR-EVA|You get it fueled yet?||LMP-EVA|No. Okay, coming soon though.||CDR-EVA|Let me know if you have any problems with that.||LMP-EVA|All right, I will.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Come on bag. You're all I got. Man, I -there we go. (Hum) Bob, that gravimeter went right to steady. It blinked once and went right to steady, so I don't expect it'll be too long.||CC|Okay, I'll give you a call in a couple of minutes there. Ought to be done.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|And Jack. I understand you have the RTG fueled?||LMP-EVA|Negative.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I'm supposed to call you when I have it fueled.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Jack, do you have a - am I missing a map I should have up here?||LMP-EVA|There should be two maps. They're under the seat. I put them in there so they wouldn't bounce off. I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you.|04 20 04 06|CDR-EVA|Okay, I got them. Hello, Houston.||CC|Hello, Challenger.||LMP-EVA|I wish I could go back and make that landing about 6 or 7 times so I could take in all that I missed.||||||Tape 78A/31||CDR-EVA|So do I. I might as well have stayed at the Cape. Okay. Let's see. Core bore neutron flux, and I'll get the drill and I'11 go back and ...||CC|Geno, you know you might wander by the gravimeter. I think it might be done by now. You might just check the light and see if it's steady, or on or not.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'll go by there right now, Bob -||LMP-EVA|For future reference, Bob, the dome removal tool doesn't - it'11 turn. Shoot.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, let's see. It's not lit. Can I take a reading?||CC|Roger. If the light's out, give us a reading.|04 20 06 01|CDR-EVA|Well, let's see if I can push the right button this time. Okay, it's 6?0 017 201, 670 017 201. And it was about 75 percent in the shade of the Rover.||CC|Okay. I copy that. And now we're ready for bias.||CDR-EVA|Now, you want - okay, a bias coming at you on the ground, correct?||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|It's blinking - it's blinking, Bob.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I've got the core bag and the neutron flux, and -||LMP-EVA|Gene, I need your hammer.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you need my help? Okay, coming over. What's the problem?||LMP-EVA|Well, the dome removal tool never latched into the dome, but it turned it. I think it's pretty badly chewed up. I'm not sure what happened.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy.||||Tape 78A/32||||LMP-EVA|So, let me have your hammer because I'm going to have to pry off the dome.||CDR-EVA|Can't you - -||LMP-EVA|No. I - I, you see I - I've stripped it, I think. I didn't think I could do it.||CDR-EVA|No. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me -||LMP-EVA|See, it's stripped. See, but it's open. Wait a minute. See, no wait, see. Just put your blade in there. Don't touch it. Put the blade in there and pry. It'll come, I hope.||CDR-EVA|Be careful. Here, let me get it once from this side. Can I -||LMP-EVA|Gene, don't get so close. Move your hand - There, you got it. Nice work.||CDR-EVA|Okay, it's off. It's off.||LMP-EVA|Nice work.||CDR-EVA|Whoo.||CC|Roger. Once again we have the right solution.||LMP-EVA|I'm not sure, Bob, what happened. You might ask them that if you only partially get the dome removal tool on, if you can strip the whole thing out?||CC|Okay, we'll look at it ...||LMP-EVA|It won't make much difference any more.||CC|We'll make sure of its change on the next dome removal tool.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm just taking a breather.||CC|Okay, we're watching you.||||||Tape 78A/33||LMP-EVA|That was a strange one, Gene. Did you see how I mangled that thing?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay, TRG i s out.||CDR-EVA|Don't trip.||LMP-EVA|Wouldn't think of it.||CDR-EVA|Okay, where was I? I've got to go back and get the drill, if I'm not mistaken. Yes sir, and then I'11 be caught up with the TGE. Okay, Houston. The RTG is inserted. The element, that is -||CC|Okay, we'11 copy that.||CDR-EVA|Bob , I'11 - I'11 give you my word. Before we leave here, I'll make sure that the SRC is closed.||CC|Okay. Copy that. As long as it's got only an inch or two showing there, should be no problem. That looks fine ...||CDR-EVA|Man, I've got to put something on it to get it down to that far.||CC|Okay.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh, that came out like a dream. Man, is this MESA low when you go - Come on, baby.|04 20 09 33|LMP-EVA|SEQ bay doors are closed.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And I'm checking out the cosmic ray. Cosmic ray looks good.||CC|Beautiful.||||Tape 78A/34||||LMP-EVA|Oh f I snuck a queek - quick peek at the drill, and it does work. What in the world is that?||CDR-EVA|That's Ron.||LMP-EVA|Ron?||CDR-EVA|That's Ron. Got his VHF on, that fink. Hey, you might tell Ron we can hear him.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Drill - LMP seat. With seat belt - Bob, you still with us?||LMP-EVA|Okay, ALSEP is put together in the barbell mode. And Charlie Duke, I have checked it - and it is locked.||CDR-EVA|Hello, there, Ron. If you read, we're reading you.||CDR-EVA|"Well, (singing) ""We're off to see the Wizard."""||LMP-EVA|Hey, do you need me, Gene?||CDR-EVA|No. I'm going to go deploy an ALSEP.||LMP-EVA|Have at it.||CDR-EVA|First, I've got to find an ALSEP site.||LMP-EVA|Don't fall into Camelot.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'd like to read a TGE.||CC|Roger. You're ready to read the TGE? We are.||CDR-EVA|Oh, you won't believe it.||LMP-EVA|You did it again.||CDR-EVA|Ah - there goes a fender. Oh, shoot!||LMP-EVA|Say, Bob, I'm moving dovn-Sun.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll get that in a minute.||||||Tape 78A/35||LMP-EVA|I'm moving down-Sun, and where we've walked, we stir up darker material - just slightly, but it's darker. The same old thing, the most mature -that most regoliths have.||CC|Okay, copy that. Have you got a bias reading there, Gene?|04 20 11 5^|CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm giving it to you right now - 337 > 454, 001 - that's 337, 454, 001||CC|Okay, we copy that.||CDR-EVA|And I hate to say it, but I'm going to have to take some time to try - I'm going to have to -I'm going to have to try to get that fender back on.||CC|Okay. Was it the rear fender, Geno?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Caught it with my hammer, and it just popped right off.||CDR-EVA|Bob, for future reference - it's a piece of cake putting the TGE on or off.||CC|Okay, copy that.||CDR-EVA|Jack, Is the tape under my seat, do you remember?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|I may need it. Okay. Let's set my hydroxide canister to middle - I'm in MAX - MAX cooling. Man, you're romping around like a - how are you doing?||LMP-EVA|Oh, fine. It's just - it's work going out here.||CDR-EVA|Yea, I'll bet it is. Just take it easy.||LMP-EVA|I am.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to be a little bit behind you if I have to work on that fender, anyway.||CC|Yes, you can walk a bit more slowly than you're walking, Jack.||||Tape 78A/36||||LMP-EVA|Okay, more and more - What's that?||CC|I said that you can walk more slowly than you started out, anyway.||LMP-EVA|Bob, texturially, same of these rock that I believe - gabbros - have a texture not unlike a -a welded tuff. But I don't think - I know they're not. But they've got some mottled characteristic to them that I haven't yet figured out.||CMP-EVA|Yes, if it wasn't for that fender, I'd be ready to go. Makes me sort of mad.||CC|I say there, Jack, that looks like a big rock there beyond you.||LMP-EVA|That'B the one we were talking about. Earlier.||CC|We believe you now.||CDR-EVA|Well, I've done this in training. I can't say I'm very adept at putting fenders back on. But I sure don't want to start without it.||CDR-EVA|Well, shoot!||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. I think I'm going to move a little bit to the northwest of my present position in order to get a little farther away from that big rock.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Jack.||LMP-EVA|And to get out of the shallow depression - -||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|- - get out of the shallow depression that's here.||CC|Roger. It's not so shallow. You disappeared out of sight from the last ...||||||Tape 78A/37|04 20 16 10|LMP-EVA|Well it's shallow relative to other depressions I've been in. You know, this ALSEP is almost as heavy as what we had at the Cape. I lost one of my blocks. Oh well, I'll - I'll get it on a rock, or I'll retrace your steps.||CDR-EVA|Don't worry about that. I'll be able to - there are enough rocks around. I can use it.||CC|Copy that, Jack. And Gene, if you're having trouble with that fender and you think it might be easier with two guys, you could wait until you get out to the ALSEP site.||CDR-EVA|No sir, I got it on, but a little piece of the rail is cracked off. And I'm just going to put a couple of pieces of good old-fashioned American gray tape on it - see whether we can't make sure it stays. Because I don't want to lose it. Except good old-fashioned gray tape doesn't want to stick very well.||LMP-EVA|I've not seen any sign of layering in any of the craters. In their walls.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|The rocks still seem to be the pinkish-gray -the pinkish-gray gabbro out here.||CDR-EVA|Good old-fashioned American gray tape doesn't stick to lunar-dust-cover fenders. One more try. I think it'll stay, for an indefinite period of time, right now. Rot bad for EV gloves.||LMP-EVA|Do you see me, Bob?||CC|We're watching Gene, right now. You disappeared out of sight a long while ago. Hey, you just came into sight again, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Hey, leave me enough room to deploy the heat flow.||LMP-EVA|I'm going to, I'm looking for a place. Away from craters and rocks.||||Tape 78A/38||||LMP-EVA|That's why I didn't land up there.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I think I've got a place. And I think it will also give you a spot for the NEUTIZON flux that's sheltered from the RTG.||CC|Okay. You say you have a place like that, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Well, - pretty much, I think, Bob.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Let me work on it here a little more.|04 20 19 36|CC|Okay, and right now you're about 10 minutes behind the time line, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm only going to spend another minute or two on the fender.||LMP-EVA|We'll catch up.||CDR-EVA|I never thought I'd be out here doing this.||LMP-EVA|Boy, I'll tell you, Geno - Okay, I'm going to go back this way. Central Station can be near a crater. It will be pretty good, that'll put the LEAM right out over there, which is probably all right. The graviometer out over there, which is probably all right. Going to put your drill holes a little too close to that rock, though. Bob, ask Mark if he's worried about rocks as much as craters.||CC|Okay, stand by.||LMP-EVA|I've got a rock about 2 meters in diameter, partially buried - that one of the probes may be near.||CC|Stand by and define near.||LMP-EVA|Well, it could be 10 feet.||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 78A/39||LMP-EVA|Well, I can move a little more south, I guess.||CC|Okay. And Jack, it seems like about - if you're about 3 meters from the rock, that's no problem.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay, this is it.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I tell you the block - the - let's see, the Sun's south, this way. South of east. Okay. Well, shoot!||CDR-EVA|What's wrong?||LMP-EVA|Well, it's just about impossible. Bob, it looks like the probes are going to be in a shallow depression. I'll try to improve that a little. It's not a real crater - it's just a shallow depression.||CC|Stand by. Stand by on that, Jack, a minute. That may be okay. Okay, shallow depression's all right, Jack, don't worry about it.||LMP-EVA.|It's not more than a meter deep.||CC|That's okay, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Stay there.||LMP-EVA|All righty. It looks pretty good to me.||CC|Okay. Good enough.||LMP-EVA|It's just - Bob, it's really, in detail - The meter and half-meter scale relief is a little more than we can stand here for a good site. But I think - I think this will be all right.||CC|Okay, copy that. We're ready to press on with ALSEP INTERCONNECT. And Geno, how are you doing on that fender?||||Tape 78A/40||||CDR-EVA|Bob, I am done. If that fender stays on, I'm going to take a picture of it because I'd like some sort of mending award. It's not too neat, but tape and lunar dust just don't hand in there together.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Well, let's hope. Keep your fingers crossed, and I'll be more careful around the fenders.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Whoops. Bob, I*m going to do one other thing real quick here. I've got to dust my visor off.||LMP-EVA|Gene, do you want me to do that?||CDR-EVA|No, I can do it. I'll just do it right here. Only have to do it in a couple of places right in front of me. That didn't do much good, did it. Someone should have told me that. That just really screwed it up. Okay. Bob, you might ought to be thinking of a good way to clean that visor when I get in the cabin.||CC|Okay, we'll put someone on that.|04 20 24 20|CDR-EVA|Okay, LRV equipment check. Blankets are open 100 percent; TV/sunshade is on; SEP receiver/ antenna - nav cable; we've got 4, 5é 6, and 7 on the charges; TGE - I've got three measurements complete, I've got the drill, the bag, and the neutron flux. The TV camera -I'm taking it away from you.||CC|Okay. Roger.|04 20 24 47|CDR-EVA|Sorry about that, Ed. Okay. MODE switch is going to 1.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Okay. MODE switch is 1. I'm ready to drive to the ALSEP site. Still want to park 60 northeast - east and north.||||||Tape 78A/4l||CC|Okay, Geno. And before you leave the LM there, how about giving me another BAT TEMP reading. Those were a little high and we'd like to try and verify some of that stuff.||CDR-EVA|Boy, oh boy. Yes, I get you Bob. Boy, oh boy. You just got to be careful where you kick dust.||LMP-EVA|That's right.||CDR-EVA|Boy! Don't do that again.||CDR-EVA|Yes, Bob, I thought they were a little high, too.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Okay. BAT TEMP are 100 and 120 - right now.||CC|Okay. How about tapping the meter a little bit for us?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I think the meter's been tapped since we've been working on the Rover. Yes - 100 and 120.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Get this baby started.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to be heading west. The low gain - is 270.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, I'm on the way.||CC|Okay, and Geno, we'd like to vary the parking a little bit because of this. We'd like to try and get those batteries cooled down. We'd like to have you park about 60 feet north of the Central Station.||CDR-EVA|Park about 50 feet from Central Station ...||CC .|And facing east. Down - Sun. And then we'll open the battery covers - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I can't read you, but facing east and down-Sun are not the same.||||Tape 78A/42||||CC|Well, approximately there.||CDR-EVA|Jack, you need your block? I got it right here.||CC|Facing - -||LMP-EVA|You're on the Rover, aren't you?||CC|Facing - -||CDR-EVA|I got it, wait a minute.||CC|Hey, Geno, we mean up-Sun. Sorry about that.||CDR-EVA|I got your block coming, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Boy, it doesn't take much to get those battery covers dirty.||CC|Okay, Gene, did you copy me that we meant facing up-Sun?||CDR-EVA|Yes, Bob.||LMP-EVA|What did you do, get ...||CC|Okay, I got that.|04 20 29 07|LMP-EVA|Bob, the shorting plug meter is 90 percent scale to the right.||CC|Okay, copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, give me that parking heading again, would you?||CC|Okay, we'd like you to park facing the Sun. How's that for being definite.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|About 60 feet north of the Central Station.||||||Tape 78A/43||CDR-EVA|Sixty feet north of Central Station - I can't park a little northeast? Now, okay, and you want the battery covers open?||CC|That's affirmative, Gene. And that means you will have to dust them before you open them.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I guess so. Man, am I glad I didn't land up here, Jack.||LMP-EVA|So am I.|04 20 30 04|CDR-EVA|Okay, ALSEP is connected, RTG is connected. Is that where you're going to have the Central Station, huh?||LMP-EVA|Well, Geno, that's the best I can do without spending a lot more time.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|And let me - let me talk to you about it. Say, I asked them about this depression.||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|You probe's all right out in here. And if you get in the bottom of it for the - eigher this one, or go out there - especially in the straight line between you and me now, another depression would be good for the neutron flux. You need to be over that way - you're just a - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, they went - they want me to park about here where - -||LMP-EVA|You need to be over here.||CDR-EVA|Where's Central Station, right there, huh?||LMP-EVA|You need to - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, I've got to park in the Sun for the batteries||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||CC|Okay, 17é for your planning -||||Tape 78A/44||||LMP-EVA|Okay, about 60 feet northeast. How does it look behind you.||CC|Okay, 17, for your planning, we're - we're now about 20 minutes behind the time line -||LMP-EVA|That's good.||CDR-EVA|You're cutting out, Bob. You'll have to wait.||CDR-EVA|What are you, Bob?||CC|Roger, we're about 20 minutes behind the time line, two-zero minutes.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Yes, I guess it could be worse considering a couple of things. Okay, about time I got those batteries. Okay, Jack, let me give you this first, so I can get to work.||LMP-EVA|Oh, the block.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|I'm sorry, I forgot you had it. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|Okay, where are we?||CDR-EVA|MARK. Sixty north heading, okay, 15 VOLT is OFF. Let me double check that while I was thinking of something. Wouldn't want this Rover to go rolling over the terrain without me. Okay, it is OFF. MODE switch, position 3. Dust TV/TCU, and the whole works, huh? There is TV REMOTE.|04 20 32 54|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. You're aligned on the high gain-||CC|Okay, we copy that.||CDR-EVA|And you're in position 3.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me get these covers dusted.||CDR-EVA|Well, that's a consolation. It's not as hard to get at the covers as one might think.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 78B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTIONS|04 20 39 29|CMP|Well, I can see Reiner Gamma real well out window 3.||CC|Roger.||CMP|I should be able to get back there next rev, I guess.||CC|Roger. Look like a gamma up there? Is that why they call it a gamma?||CMP|Hey, that sure does. Oddly enough, it almost looks like an elongated crater in this - this light.||CC|Roger.||CMP|You know, with the gamma part of it ...||CC|Now, we've got both of - we got two - or a number of picture-taking sections here next rev, but we got that sequence on Copernicus and that sequence on Reiner Gamma there.||CMP|Aha. Okay.||CMP|And now, I'll see if I can find Riccioli.||CMP|I should be able to see Grimaldi, I think.||CC|Getting pretty easy to locate yourself as you go along your track?||CMP|Yes, it's starting to get that way. It's not as good as I - as I want it yet. Every once in awhile, you look out of the window, you don't have the slightest idea where you are (chuckle).||CC|Right.||CMP|Yes, I can see Grimaldi and Riccioli coming up now. Just passing over the edge of the mare ...||||Tape 78B/2||||CC|Roger. That's Grimaldi mare there?||CMP|Yes, I can see it coming up.||CC|Okay.||CMP|There's a pretty stark difference between the mare and the - I guess you might as well go ahead and call them highlands, that's what they look like.||CMP|East of Procellarum, in fact just before you get to Grimaldi.|04 20 44 32|CMP|Okay, I want to switch to window 3. A little better to try and get the pictures.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Getting too much glare on the windows.||CMP|Okay, Bob. That is correct. Now, you want to continue on across here at a 15th, huh?||CC|Roger.|0U 20 48 53|CC|Okay, Ron. No ... for picture taking, but you need to select OMNI A when you get a chance.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|There you go.||CC|Good show.||CMP|Say, I can only take 18 pictures on that, I think.||CC|Say again, Ron.||CMP|It will only take 18 pictures, I think.||CC|Roger.||CMP|(Laughter) Fool around in here by yourself, and you get disoriented.||||||Tape 78B/3|04 20 54 05|CMP|Well, I didn't see any slices down there that time.||CC|Roger.||CC|Hey, you're looking good, Ron. You're right on the Flight Plan. We haven't missed a thing yet today, I don't think. In really good shape.||CMP|Oh, okay. Good. I tell you, there's a little more hussling up here than I thought there would be though.||CC|Keeping you busy, huh?||CMP|(Laughter) Yes, a little bit. That's all right. It's fun.||CC|Just don't want you to get lonely up there.||CMP|(Laught er) Sure won't.||CMP|Okay. That was mag Zebra Zebra, I guess. Started out just like we had it planned. Took two each in 1 second and a half, and then a fourth, and then an eighth. The total count on this camera is going to be 50 instead of 60.||CC|Back at 150.||CMP|And then the rest of them - -||CC|Yes.||CMP|- - And then the rest of them are l60 - 150 throughout, except the last 2 foot and a half.||CC|Okay.||CC|I'll get a confirmation on some, Ron, but I think when we get on to Reiner Gamma on that pass of target 15 Delta, we're not going to have enough film left to run out over Riccioli and that area, which is already taken. That's why we hate to take these now, because when - when we come up there in the next pass, you're not going to have enough film.||||Tape 78B/4||||CMP|Oh, I see. Okay.||CMP|Let's see. While I got the camera out, I can look ahead, I guess, and see what - what mag to put in there.||CMP|WW, I guess, huh?||CC|Yes, that's affirm. WW on the lunar ...||CMP|Okay. Give you that.||CC|Ron, comm is getting pretty bad down here with us, we're going to lose you in about 4 minutes, maybe 5, completely. And we'll pick you back up at - 120:28 thereabouts, 120:28.||CMP|120:28. Okay. We'll see you there.||CC|Roger.|04 21 01 52|CC|Ron, you're about ready to go over the hill. You're looking really good.||CMP|Okay, Robert. Thank you much. See you in about 45 minutes then, I guess.||CC|That's affirmative.|04 21 20 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 17|04 21 50 05|CC|Hello, Ron. How's it going up there?||CMP|Hey, pretty good, Robert. The last photo pass was a - a good one.||CMP|Just about half an Earth now.||CC|Roger.|04 21 53 01|CMP|Houston, America. The mag Lima Lima is on frame number 54 now.||CC|Roger, Ron. We copy. Lima Lima on 5^-||||||Tape 78B/5||CMP|And mag - and mag Quebec, Quebec is starting on frame 53.||CC|Roger. We copy.|04 22 02 16|CMP|Houston, America. I got to unplug you for a little bit. I'm so tangled up in my hoses here, I'm getting strangled to death.||CC|Okay. No problem, Ron. We'll just sit. Give us a call when you're back on the air. Okay?|04 22 08 01|CMP|Houston, do you need OMNI Bravo yet? Will you give me a call when you want it?||CC|Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call. You can go on to Bravo now, Ron.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Do you have it? Okeydoke.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 79A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|04 20 34 05|LMP-EVA|Okay; I'm working on the LEAM connection now, Bob.||CC|Okay. I copy that, Jack. Understand you - -||LMP-EVA|Say, it's hard to hit that garbage pile.||CC|Roger. Understand you almost have the heat flow connector connected by now?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CDR-EVA|I'm a little late, Jack, until I get these battery covers opened.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got the heat flow for you.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Well, the old LEAM connector doesn't connect, just like usual, or lock.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm not going to touch the batteries. The covers are clean, and the batteries themselves are clean. The LR - LCRU has been dusted and - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|It's locked. - -||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|- - LEAM's locked on.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to use this.|04 20 35 44|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. The battery covers are in the shade.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.|04 20 36 02|CDR-EVA|Well, well, well, well, okay; I hope that helps. Whoo! I'm going to go to MAX for a minute here. Do you buy that?||||Tape 79A/2||||CC|Okay, Geno. We copy.||CDR-EVA|It seems hot in the valley of Taurus.||CC|Okay.|04 20 36 27|CDR-EVA|Okay. Oh, man, - Whoo! Yes, I'm going back to INTERMEDIATE.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I'm ready to go to work.||CC|Good.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to push the gravimeter.||CC|Roger -|04 20 36 42|CC|MARK.|04 20 36 51|CDR-EVA|Okay. You have a mark.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|- - It's blinking, and remember what I said, it's a piece of cake to take on and off.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. This is north over here, huh? Okay, load old heat flow, 10 ... northwest. You connector connected. Carry heat flow 30. on ground, experiment up; okay. Way to do Jack. Keep your eye on cables.|Off-got the Place that,|MP-EVA|Oh, man, all I could do is go down hill over here.||CDR-EVA|Jack, do you read?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I'm just trying to level - -||CDR-EVA|Are you going to move that very much?||||||Tape 79A/3||LMP-EVA|No, I'm just - I'll be working with it to try to level it. It's - that's going to be a major task.||CDR-EVA|Okay, there's 30 feet, I'll just -I'll get this thing squared away when I - Okay, Boyd bolt time.||LMP-EVA|Ha, wheel That really went. Man, these things are just like they are at the Cape. You can feel every one of them.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, has Ron been able to see the LM?||CC|Stand by. I'll find out.||LMP-EVA|Oh - oh -||CC|Watch it, Jack.|04 20 39 06|CDR-EVA|First cable - first cable hooked. Jack, you all right?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I'll straighten it up in a minute. Okay. The LSG is going out.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I hope it does the things that we want it to for us.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I'm not doing too badly on keeping things clean. The - the base of the central station and -got some stuff on it, but - otherwise it's pretty good.||CC|Okay, Jack. We appreciate your efforts, and we understand you got the LEAM connected eventually.||LMP-EVA|Yes, and it locked; just took some diddling. Okay. Sun's over there. Oops, I forgot my Boyd bolts. Let's see.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I never drilled a hole where there's not a can.||LMP-EVA|Boyd bolts are OFF. Bob, does it bother him that the base of the LSG is touch - touching soil? Because this is pretty soft.||||Tape 79A/4||||LMP-EVA|Bob, did you give me an answer?||CC|Roger. Ron thinks he has seen it. We haven't had a confirmation on the last orbit when you were talking to him, but he thinks he saw it the previous orbit.||LMP-EVA|Hey, hey, Bob. Hey, Bob.||CC|Go.||LMP-EVA|Can the LSG - the base of the LSG, be touching the soil?||CC|Stand by on that. Roger, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Well, it's very soft and it's going to be very hard to level for it.||CC|Roger, Jack. The base can be touching the ground.|04 20 4l 37|LMP-EVA|Okay. It's level, aligned, the sunshield is shaded inside. The level bubble is just touching the outer circle; a one circle. And I improved that. It's perfectly centered now and I'm going to uncage. Whoops. I moved - the experiment moved. It's still pretty good level. Okay, it's uncaged; the gimbal is swinging.||CC|Okay. Copy that.|04 20 42 26|LMP-EVA|The gimbal is swinging.||CC|Copy that. And Jack, you're still in MAX - -||LMP-EVA|The bubble is back just touch - Yes, I know - -||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I've been working, man.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|"Okay. I went to ""pseudo intermediate,"" between minimum and intermediate. The bubble is just touching the - its circle, and the alignment - Sun alignment is good."||||||Tape 79A/5||CC|Roger. Copy that. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Gene. You've got some good slack here, if you can leave it that way. You shouldn't have the cable draped across anything, that's good.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I want to try and get this thing in there. It won't - there it is.||LMP-EVA|Can I help you, Gene?||CDR-EVA|No. I got a little dust in this mirror, though. I'm not sure I - Bob, I got a little dust on the white surface, not on the mirror - of the heat flow. You got any recommendations?||CC|Stand by on that, Jack - Gene. Is that the - on the heat reflector?||CDR-LMP|Yes. Yes, it's on the north side.||CC|Okay. As long as it's not on the mirror, it's okay, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Well, let me take another look. I'll double check.||LMP-EVA|Watch it. You're pulling pretty hard.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm watching - -||LMP-EVA|You're pulling - -||CDR-EVA|I'm watching; I'm not pulling. Okay. The mirror's clean.||CC|Okay; then, it's good enough.||mP-EVA|Give me some more slack up here, you're draped.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay. That's where it's going, Jack, right there.||LMP-EVA|Can you - okay.||CDR-EVA|How's that?||||Tape 79A/6||||LMP-EVA|That's good.||CDR-EVA|Got enough?||LMP-EVA|This way just a little, Geno. That's good. Doesn't take much.||CDR-EVA|Man, we sure didn't need blocks or anything out here. There's enough soil here to level almost anything.||LMP-EVA|But that's so soft, though, it's hard to get a -fast level. Whoops! That's strange. I think I did something wrong.||CDR-EVA|What's that?||LMP-EVA|Pulled the pin at the wrong time ...||CDR-EVA|Okay. The heat flow is level; the gnomon is good. And, Bob, I verified that that dirt is not on the mirror. It's on - on the white stuff that -that, you know, is horizontal to the surface of the box.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene; that's okay.||CDR-EVA|The mirror - mirror's - the mirror's clean.||CC|Roger. Thank you.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay, I'll give you a TGE reading.||CC|Roger. We're ready.|04 20 46 17|CDR-EVA|Okay; 670 002 601 - 6?0 002 601.||CC|Okay. We copy that.||CDR-EVA|Bob, was that with the camera - with the camera running?||CC|Roger. The camera's been running all this time.||CDR-EVA|That's beautiful. Okay. Your temperatures are down to a hundred - and maybe a sukosh 120 under, so maybe those batteries are cooling off.||||||Tape 79A/7||CC|Okay; good.||CDR-EVA|It's sure good. I don't want to walk on that third EVA.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|I'm getting to like driving this machine. Okay, pull pin 2. Pin 2 always comes after - goes before pin 1.||LMP-EVA|I think that's in the NASA documents now.||CDR-EVA|What's that?||LMP-EVA|Pin 2 comes before pin 1.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) Okay.||LMP-EVA|Reel 3 comes before reel 1 and 2, also. I think I overdid that one.||CC|Yes, it went clean out of sight; but by all means, watch reel 2.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Oh, you think you're so clever. Believe it or not, Bob, I'm anchoring the geophone module.||CC|Hey, Jack, it looks to us on the TV as though you're m - anchoring the geophone module with a flag.||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's what I'm doing. I'm anchoring the geophone module with a flag.|04 20 48 i4|CDR-EVA|Okay; one leg, two legs, three legs. And none of them - none of them -||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, remind me to police the garbage pile.||CC|All right.||LMP-EVA|The garbage pile is turning out to be - just like every other ALSEP deployment. It's hard to control.||||Tape 79A/8||||CC|And I understand all your legs came out okay, Geno, or didn't come out.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Yes, sir; they all came out okay.|04 20 48 51|LMP-EVA|Okay. LMS ring is pulled.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Amazing. Amazing.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. I've got ray tools of the trade right here. I'm ready to go to work. Now I put a mark in the deck - Here it is; right there.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob, what have I forgotten? The package won't rotate.||CC|Try rotating the UHT.||LMP-EVA|No, I'm serious. Oh, rotate the UHT, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes, remember that one?||LMP-EVA|No - that's right. I'm sorry. I knew it, I knew it would happen.||CDR-LMP|Where's your garbage pile, Jack? Well, I - I can't find yours.||LMP-EVA|Well, don't worry about my garbage pile. It turns out it looks very much like the ALSEP.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I made a mark over here that says - that says that should be about cable length.||LMP-EVA|What am I doing over here? You're awfully -you're awfully close.||CDR-EVA|No, my - my - I'm going right in here, Jack. Right here.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I can move it further - -||LMP-EVA|No. That's all right.||||||Tape 79A/9||CDR-EVA|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|No, this will be all right. I just want to keep away from you there.||CDR-EVA|We shall soon see how tuned we are. I'm anxious to see what's under this mantle.||CC|So are we.||CDR-EVA|Well, Bob, I hope I can drill you a couple of good holes.||CC|How about three?||CDR-EVA|And I know you do, too.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, the arrow is east/west, pointing west. The bubble is in the center. If I'm lucky, it'll stay there. I'm not - I'm more like east/northeast I'm trying to keep a little further away from Gene.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Break seal is OPEN.|04 20 52 02|CDR-EVA|Okay, that was my MARK. Let me see. Double check that cable length. I'd sure hate to drill a hole that was outside of the - length of the cable.|04 20 52 22|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, the LMS is deployed. I'm policing the site. The screen is over the port.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|I'm going to more - one big rock. What am I doing down in here?||CDR-EVA|What were you doing down in there?||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Okay. And, Bob - -||CDR-EVA|||||Tape 79A/10||||LMP-EVA|- - Bob, there's a little bit of dust adhering to the - sides of the LMS. And a few particles less than - half a percent of the surface on the top. But, of course, you're going to clean that one off; so that's all right.||CC|That's affirm on the top.||LMP-EVA|The - the north side has about a - 10- or 15-percent dust cover.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|...||CC|- And, Geno, you're leaning pretty heavy forward on that drill.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. She went in - she's going in like she's in some pretty dead stuff, and then I hit some rock here. I'll watch it - I won't lean forward. I'm not putting too much pressure on it.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|It sounds to me like she's chippering away through rock. May be just a little longer drilling hole than it was at the Cape.|04 20 55 14|CDR-EVA|Bob, she's going in - but not without a little bit of resistance.||CC|Roger. We're observing that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Every once in a while - every once in a while, she breaks through a soft spot.||CC|Good.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I'll tell you, this central station's a bear - bear to get level. Well, I just got dust on it now.||LMP-EVA|It's just too soft.||||||Tape 79A/11||CDR-EVA|Boy, that sure was drilling in hard stuff because it took a lot to get it off.||CC|Okay, Jack. And we could certainly stand a little bit of dust, at least on top of that central station sunshield.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I guess the level's important.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|I can just see what John's thinking right now. That's what makes the difference. That's where you expend your energy.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I don't know that I'm going to be able to do that without a lot of time. It's hanging against the south edge.||CC|Say again there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I don't know whether I'm going to be able to level it - the central station.||CDR-EVA|Anything I can do, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got it off the edge.||CC|Okay; maybe we better just leave it there.||LMP-EVA|Well, I'm making it worse by getting dust on the top.||CC|No, the dust on the top is not as important as getting it leveled, Jack. But if you get it broken off the edge, that ought to be good enough.|04 20 59 02|CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm riding at about 382. I've got - oh, I guess, about 80 - Well, no, there's half - I guess, 60 percent; no flags and no tones.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno.|04 20 59 24|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. It's touching the second ring; the gnomon is aligned, and I'm going to leave it alone.||CC|Roger on that.||||Tape 79A/12||||LMP-EVA|Yes, I think I lost all the time I might have made up.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, it's obvious that I'm going through some pretty stuff - tough stuff. Consolidated material, like rock fragments, and then it breaks through; and then it jumps for about 3 or 4 inches and then I hit some more fragments.||CC|Roger. We're seeing that Geno. Looks interesting.||LMP-EVA|Oh, me. I got too low on that one. I thought I had that gaged.||CDR-EVA|If you deploy that geophone, you'll go out of sight.||CDR-EVA|Bob, there would be absolutely no way of breaking this drill from that - those bores without that tool, I guarantee you that.||CC|Okay. We copy that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|I think I found a way to get this off, though, with a little help. Okay, number 3 coming up.||CC|Roger. The third and last one on this hole.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. Oh, boy. Time out.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Don't work too hard.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|My fender's still on, which makes me happy. I'll tell you, if you could come and sprinkle the whole area with water and get rid of some of this dust -||CC|Okay, Geno. And can you remember if those heat flow cables are not crossed as they come out of that box?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. I very definitely made a point of them -not crossing them.||CC|Okay; very good.||||||Tape 79A/13|04 21 02 45|CDR-EVA|They are not - they are not crossed.||CC|Good.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Where do we find such men?||CDR-EVA|How's it coming, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Oh, slow. This leveling is really throwing me behind the power curve; but I know they - they're serious about it, so - If I can keep it where it is now, I'm in like Flynn. It's perfectly centered, Even the gnomon is aligned within a shadow width.||CDR-EVA|Man, is that thing biting.||LMP-EVA|Really working down there, are you?||CDR-EVA|Oh, you betcha, man. I'm in something tough down there now. Whew.||LMP-EVA|Well, what - what bore are you in?||CDR-EVA|Number 3. If I let go of that drill and it kept running - If that drill kept running and I wasn't anchored to the ground - -||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|#NAME?||CC|Okay, Geno - -||CDR-EVA|I think I'm in the mother lode down there.||CC|Gene, if its getting really tough and you're not making much progress, we'll be happy with it where it is.||CC|Well, looks like you really - -||CDR-EVA|No, sir, you're going to be happy with it where it's supposed to be; and that's where it's - -||||Tape 79A/14||||CC|You were hiding it from us - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||CC|We couldn't tell how deep in you were.||CDR-EVA|I wanted to surprise you. They're going in all the way, and they're both going to work. It's a little tough looking into the Sun.||LMP-EVA|Yes.|04 21 05 10|CDR-EVA|Oh, Manischewitz! I don't know where I picked that work up, but (chuckle) it's better than some, I guess. Now if I can use my little lean-to here. Oh, man, that works great. That works great. Put this out of the way. Bob, I'm into the white mark; it depends on what you want to call the surface. You know, it's - I can - I can give you 6 -or give or take 6 or 8 inches.||CC|Yes, something like that will do, Gene, I guess. You can measure it ...||LMP-EVA|Gene, is the dust coming up changing color on you at all?||CDR-EVA|No, Jack. It isn't changing color. I can't even tell - I can't even tell vhere it's coming up.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|I don't think it is coming up, I think I'm just pushing it aside.||LMP-EVA|Bqy, I'11 tell you - -||CC|I saw something come up then just then, Jack.||LMP-EVA|- - the old ALSEP central station - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, it deploys itself; it turns out.||CC|Roger on that. That was - -||LMP-EVA|Bob--||||||Tape 79A/15||CC|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|Okay. When I - I finally leveled it in a bull's eye. I don't know whether you heard me or not, but it was - it was perfect. So it's okay. It's just got a fair - it's got about 20-percent dust cover on the top.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|... Glad you've got that probe covered.||CC|And, Jack, ALSEP says that that's okay ... but that's no problem.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I put a rock under the northwest comer. Oops - guess what happened? (Laughter) Just like in training, Geno.||CDR-EVA|What happened?||LMP-EVA|The old geophone cable caught on the corner.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Oops, I'm not ready. That says F4B on that; that's an airplane.|04 21 08 27|CDR-EVA|Houston, there's no dust on the probe except that which was on my hands.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|That must be solar wind.||LMP-EVA|- Sorry not to be more talkative, but - this is taking al1 the concentration I got. I'll have to push this down, I can see that. Yes, this ... doesn't hold any better here than it - did in training.||CDR-EVA|Oh, don't - don't lose that - Geno, don't lose that - don't lose that. Notice how you talk to yourself out here?||LMP-EVA|Who, me? (Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Help.||||Tape 79A/l6||||LMP-EVA|I says - you is getting farther and farther behind.||CDR-EVA|Well, I've had my one for today.||LMP-EVA|Your one what?||CDR-EVA|"Well, I just did my ""whifferdill."""||LMP-EVA|Oh, did you fall?||CDR-EVA|No. It's funny how for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, isn't it?||LMP-EVA|Hey, I've heard that before. Okay, Secure thermal curtains.|04 21 10 05|LMP-EVA|Thermal curtains are secured.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|How far behind am I, Bob?||CC|Stand by. Roger. We're showing - Gene, just about 20 minutes; and Jack, just about 25 -between 20 and 25 minutes for both of you.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|#NAME?||CC|Stand by.||CDR-EVA|Oh, if this thing isn't going to work better than that -|04 21 11 52|CDR-EVA|Bob, just like the book says, it's down to Papa 1; and it hooked.||CC|How about that.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy, the old fingers really suffer on these.||LMP-EVA|Take it easy.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Now this one down to FI. Would you believe FI?||||||Tape 79A/17||CC|Yes, I believe you, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Bob, in this soil, best number I can give you is about an inch below the white spots - or Bravo 1.||CC|Okay. Copy Bravo 1.||CDR-EVA|I got a - I got a better way of putting that last thermal shield on now.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, you're looking at it - coming out to the south, but I don't expect it'll stay that way unless I put some dirt over the cable. How does that grab you?||CC|Stand by, Gene.||CDR-EVA|You like that thermal shield the way it is? Okay. That's coming out south. That's in good shape. I'm pleased with that.||CC|Dirts okay, if you want to put it on there, Gene.||CDR-EVA|... happy with it. I'm moving on.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Now the thermal shield is on there, Bob. I got them all on there.||CC|I was talking about - If you want to put some dirt on there to hold it down, that's okay.||CDR-EVA|Oh, okay. Well, I got it down without the dirt.||CC|Okay. Good enough.||CDR-EVA|I'm just finding all sorts of good ways to make life easier out here.||LMP-EVA|Stay away from the cable.||CDR-EVA|Bob, and I didn't forget the last measurement either.||CC|Roger that.||||Tape 79A/18||||CDR-EVA|Hey, can you see this big mound that I just walked - it's just to the north - not the mound -the depression that's just to the north of me?||CC|Roger, 17-||CDR-EVA|It's probably behind the Rover. Okay. Well, how's - how's that look for the core?||CC|St and by.|04 21 15 26|CC|Geno, can you give us a distance estimate to that? Does it look like it's 80 feet or so?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CC|Okay. Then that sounds good.||LMP-EVA|Oh, shucks. Hey, Bob, is there any way a level bubble can fail (laughter)?||CC|Hey, Jack, remember that's on top of those wobbly legs and - or wobbly springs there. And with the thing not being straight, you shouldn't really expect the level bubble to be level after the thing's been deployed. That happened at the Cape a couple of times, remember?||LMP-EVA|Yes, but Bob, I've - I've moved this practically all the way down the full throw and it - That bubble won't move, and I can't get it to move by tilting it; and I was level. And the bubble on the top of the central station is still level.||CC|Okay. You're talking about the level on your other one, huh? Stand by on that.||LMP-EVA|The gnomon, yes - Both of them? I can't get it to move to the other side of the - fluid.||CDR-EVA|Keep working. That - that thing shouldn't fail.||LMP-EVA|Well, I've gone full throw - -||CDR-EVA|That's not level.||||||Tape 79A/19||LMP-EVA|That bubble's stuck in there, somehow. In both of them. That's not even pointing close to the Earth. Okay, I'm going to have to tweak it up and let them see the signal strength - and tweak it.||CC|Okay. Why don't you try and manually point it -try and level it and see if we - see what you can do toward getting it towards the Earth.||LMP-EVA|I will, Bob. That bubble's just not working. I -I can't figure that one out.||CC|Okay. Just go ahead and use the - -||LMP-EVA|Okay. Maybe I jarred it loose here.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I think I jarred it loose.||CC|That's another first - -||LMP-EVA|Don't ask me how.||CC|- - Okay, we won't.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got the other one loose. That's very strange. A sticky level bubble. (Laughter) Never heard of it.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob.||CC|Go ahead, Jack - Gene.||CDR-EVA|If you're looking at me, what I'm talking about is this depression - is this depression in here for the core - oh, maybe 15é 20 meters out in here. Jack, what did you have in mind for the neutron flux?||LMP-EVA|Either the one you're in - you're down in there, or next one over behind that rock in front of you over there.||CDR-EVA|Hey, I can go way over there. That's not too far probably for - -||||Tape 79A/20||||LMP-EVA|Well, either way I think is fine, Gene. But I would suggest behind the rock.||CDR-EVA|- - For a neutron flux, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir; and the core.||CDR-EVA|Well, I wanted - I thought they wanted a core in that depression.||LMP-EVA|Well, that - there's also one over there.||CC|Okay, and - 17 - -||LMP-EVA|... a choice.||CDR-EVA|I'll go behind that rock; that looks good from here.||CC|And, 17, we think you guys are in far - by far the best position to judge that - far better than we are. You know what the requirements are on shielding and - -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|- - greater than 50 meters - 25 meters.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. Okay. The long - long bores in.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Gene. Looked like that one went in fairly well.||CDR-EVA|Well, probably about like the other one did. Not -not too bad.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I must be getting old.||CDR-EVA|I expect the next two are going to be a little harder.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I'm not very happy with this level. But I'll turn it on and - Have me come back a little bit later, when they've warmed up some more, and let's see what it looks like.||||||Tape 79A/21||CC|Okay. We'll do that. Give me a mark when you turn it on, and we'll see what kind of signals we get.||LMP-EVA|Okay. The shadow gnomon is - aligned; I'm going to turn the shorting plug on.||CC|Copy that.|04 21 20 05|LMP-EVA|It's on.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|And - the needle is fullscale left.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|I can't believe that.||LMP-EVA|What's your problem?||CDR-EVA|Well, that whole bore turns in the - in the ground, it's so loose. I got - and I got that -You know how those threads sometimes stick on you a little bit. I got one stuck halfway down and the whole bore is turning, so now I've got to use a wrench on it.||CC|Okay, Jack. And we have - -||LMP-EVA|Bob, I've got a - I've got a - rock about 10 feet southeast of my LEAM location. I can move - I can move a little more north and get, oh - get 15 feet from that. That okay?||CC|How big is the rock there , Jack?||LMP-EVA|Oh, it stands - it's a meter wide and stands about a third of a meter high.||CC|About a third, and about a foot high?||CDR-EVA|Bob, how's that for - -||LMP-EVA|A third of a meter.||CC|Okay.||||Tape T9A/22||||CDR-EVA|Bob, how's that for soil mechanics? I pulled the first bore right on out trying to get this thing on right.||CC|Well, put it in - put it in before your hole fills up there, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Right now I'm interested in getting this second bore on. Now, let's see if I can get it back in. Well, not quite as far, but high enough for me to reach the - It still feels, Bob, like there's a lot of fragmental material down there.||CC|I copy that, Geno. Good luck.||CDR-EVA|That was an interesting little - exercise. Well, I got the bore on right, anyway.||LMP-EVA|Well, shoot.||CC|Okay, Jack. As long as it's only 1 foot high and 10 feet away, that's satisfactory.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|04 21 24 54|LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob , the LEAM's deployed, aligned; and the level bubble is - just touching the inner ring.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Bob. Did you get anything from the ALSEP yet?||CC|Watch that cable, Jack. Roger. We started to tell you that when you had the question there, and we're getting a good lockup on the data.||LMP-EVA|Well, keep an eye on it, because I'm not happy with the level.||CC|Okay. We'll get back with you on that.||LMP-EVA|I'll check. ... checking.||LMP-EVA|I found a way to get over cables.||CDR-EVA|Shoot.||||||Tape 79A/23||LMP-EVA|(Laughter)||CDR-EVA|Oh, Manis chewit z. Whew.||LMP-EVA|There you go again.||CDR-EVA|I know. Let me get this one off and take a ... here.||LMP-EVA|I'm kind of having trouble with UHTs today. They just don't want to lock in when you get dust in there.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack. Be careful with that UHT on the heat flow because it was aligned - real good.||LMP-EVA|It was what?||CDR-EVA|The heat flow experiment electronics, when you go over there for that UHT, was aligned.||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I'm going to take a zap of cold water.||CC|Okay. Sounds good to me.||CDR-EVA|Whee. Almost looks like it's getting dark out. Is it? Guess not.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) Hope not, or we is in trouble.||CDR-EVA|I think I may have gone the wrong way. I did. I went to MIN instead of MAX. Here it comes. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Man. Watch it. Okay, Jack. You're all right. Still deploying.||LMP-EVA|Huh?||CDR-EVA|Still deploying. Nothing; you're all right. It's coming out a little - hard.||LMP-EVA|Wouldn't you know it?||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm back in MIN, Bob.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||||Tape 79A/24||||CDR-EVA|By any chance have any heat flow data yet?||CC|No, Geno. We don't have the heat flow turned on yet.||CDR-EVA|All right. Oh, that's right. Okay. I think that's right. Okay. I'm about to give you your number. Oh, darn it. (Laughter) Crank it a couple of times. Clean as a whistle. Clean as a whistle.||LMP-EVA|Well, just like I thought; antenna doesn't want to go in.|04 21 28 57|CC|Is that the number 3 section there, Geno?||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's in.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, Bob.||CC|Roger. Beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Well, it's the last one I got. I guess we'll find out when I put the probe in. I think they're all in there.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm about ready to deploy some geophones.||CC|Okay, Jack. Did you get the antenna into that pallet okay, eventually?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CC|Good enough.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I occasionally hit stuff and it - it spits this whole drill back at me. Knocks it back about a half an inch or so, and then it will bite -bite through it.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|My general impression is that there is an awful lot of fragments I'm busting up down there.||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 79A/25||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. That last 6 inches, I really came into something hard; but it's down all the way.||CC|Beautiful, Geno.||LMP-EVA|Oops, there's a heat flow probe.||CDR-EVA|What happened?||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) I - I messed up -||CDR-EVA|Man, don't hit that. Give me heart failure after all that drilling.||LMP-EVA|No, I just walked too close to it. I apologize for that.||CDR-EVA|I don't care how close you walk to it -||LMP-EVA|Well, ... does ... does.||CDR-EVA|Just don't step on it.||LMP-EVA|I do that ...||CDR-EVA|Ooh. Hey, Bob, just out of curiosity, what kind of heart rates has this drill been producing on me?||CC|Stand by. Okay, you've been running at 120 flush, Gene, with peaks of l40 to 150 from time to time.||CDR-EVA|Okay.|04 21 32 02|CC|And there goes the last heat flow hole on the Moon.||CDR-EVA|Oh. Yes, sir. I tell you, if you learn how to use your instruments in this l/6g, you take your time and you get around; it's frank phenomenal. But if you try and bend over without some help; not so phenomenal.||CDR-EVA|Boy, what a ride that Challenger gave us coming down. What a ride.||CDR-EVA|Oh, you dummy - you dummy. Jack you still with me.||||Tape 79A/26||||LMP-EVA|Yes,||CDR-EVA|Okay. Boy, I'm getting dropsies now. Getting dropsies.||LMP-EVA|Don't push it.||CDR-EVA|Getting dropsies.||LMP-EVA|Take a rest.||CDR-EVA|Unbelievable - unbelievable.|04 21 35 11|CC|Okay, Geno. And the heat flow is on and looking good.||CDR-EVA|That's good news , Bob. Let me give you another one here. While it's ... I'll tell you I'm in to the bottom of the white marks, and that's -oh, about Bravo 1 again.||CC|Okay, I copy. Papa 1, Foxtrot 1, and Bravo 1?||CDR-EVA|No, sir, Bob. Now the - the bore stem is in to the top of the white marks; I'm still putting the probe down.||CC|Okay, copy that. - -||CDR-EVA|And the top of the white marks is about bravo 1.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|About bravo 1. Okay. Here go - here goes the probe. Pick a number you'd like to hear. How about Papa 1?||CC|How about Papa 1 there, Geno.|04 21 36 29|CDP-EVA|Bingo, babe, you win; and it locked in.||CC|Roger. I think Mark won on that one, too.||CDR-EVA|Papa 1.||CC|Roger. And, Jack, I gather you are probably traipsing across the landscape with a geophone about now, right?||||||Tape 79A/27||LMP-EVA|That's firm.||CC|Okay. And let me ask you - -||CDR-EVA|Good gravy! You know how big that rock -||CC|Stand by. Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead, Bob.||CC|Okay. I gather - you said that the heat - the LEAM was leveled and aligned, and I gather that meant it was on the black decal on top. Do you happen to remember what number was on that?||LMP-EVA|Well, I'll check it. But I think you know where that decal is.||CC|Well, okay. Good enough.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob. The little thermal shield went to FI.||CC|Hey, that's another bingo.||CDR-EVA|And it's coming out to the south. I'm coming out to the south.||CC|Roger.|04 21 38 07|CDR-EVA|And the thermal shield is in place.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Well, it was until I moved it. Do I need my javelin anymore?||LMP-EVA|You might.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I might.||CC|One never - one never knows, Geno.||CDR-EVA|I think I'll save it until after - I think I'll save it until after I drill the core. Oh, me oh my.||LMP-EVA|Take it easy, Geno. You sound like you're -||||Tape 79A/28||||CDR-EVA|No, I'm doing fine.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|That Sun is just bright. I ought to put those visors down, i suppose - those other visors. Okay. Let me take a look at my list and see whether I've got everything. Measured, measured; height, height; you've got all the shields; you're coming out south; verify heat flow is level and aligned -It is aligned and gnomon was good; UHT to the LRV LMP seat; and then what do I do? Let me see. Deep core prep. Jack, I'm going to leave the UHT in the heat flow in case you need it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm going to go behind a rock over there -||LMP-EVA|Now, now.||CDR-EVA|In that depression. Bob, you do want the core in a depression, right?||CC|Roger. That's affirmative, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay, nobody touch my heat flow. That's the prettiest Job I've ever done. Okay, I'm going behind a boulder over here. Bob, I've got about 385; and, I guess, about 50 percent. I can't see it too well.||CC|I copy that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|And no flags and no tone; and' I'm on - I'm on intermediate coolant and I feel great.||LMP-EVA|Likewise; and I'm - -||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|- - and LMP is - LMP is 56 percent.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|What are you, Geno?||||||Tape 79A/29||CDR-EVA|Well, I can't see it. The Sian was - I don't know, Jack. I can't - It was about 5 - yes, about 55 or 54.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Now, this ought to shield that thing from the doggone -||LMP-EVA|Pressure's 385 on the LMP.||LMP-EVA|Bob, one comment on - getting the geophones within a few degrees of vertical - In this undulating terrain (chuckle), I think they're pretty good; but it's not real easy to tell what vertical is.||CC|Roger, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Well, this is right in line with the shallow depression; and it's right in line with the -RTG, with a rock in the middle.||CC|Okay, Geno. As long as you're drilling behind the rocks from the RTG, that's great.||CDR-EVA|That's where you're going to get it. Let me see what I need. Drill, rack, core bag - drill at 1 IPS. Okay. Let's go do it right.|04 21 42 29|CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me see, I'm going to put it right in this depression. Right in it.||LMP-EVA|There, get the middle of that.||CDR-EVA|It's a shallow one. If I go over there, I'm not shielded, Jack.||LMP-EVA|No, that's good. Get in the middle. Get it in that place.||CDR-EVA|Right in this little - It's only about a 4-meter depression.||LMP-EVA|Oh, wait a minute - oh, you're on the other side of the rock. Okay.||||Tape 79A/30||||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes. Yes, I want to get back here.||LMP-EVA|That's good. Oh, man, go slow.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the - all of these big boulders around here that I've looked at, are the same - same rock type.||LMP-EVA|Oh - who pulled over the geophone module?||CDR-EVA|Can't imagine.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That sounds like the title of a book.||CDR-EVA|Oh, oh. There it went.||LMP-EVA|What happened?||CDR-EVA|Oh, I lost my vise. I see it. I see it.||LMP-EVA|Hope I took number 1 in the right direction. Yes. Okay, number 4 will be a little hard to pick up.||CDR-EVA|Boy, all these little craters are filled with glass. Come on back here. I've got to chase this thing over the lunar surface.||LMP-EVA|I've seen glass covers. Oh, about out towards there, I guess.||LMP-EVA|As I was saying, Bob, all these big blocks that I've looked at look like the gabbroic rock that I was talking about - possibly upwards of 50-percent plagioclase rather than 30 like the mare - but an intermediate gabbro of some kind. And one big block there had very sharply defined -parallel parting planes. I think there is a foliation of minerals that parallel that parting, but I'll have to check it out.|04 21 46 08|CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Those parting planes go over the - go through the whole boulder on the order of at least 3 meters long and outcrop.||||||Tape 79A/31||LMP-EVA|How is it going, Gene?||CDR-EVA|Fine. I'm on my second stem, here - or I'm starting on it. How are you coming?||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm just about ready to - pick up - old the biggy, geophone 4.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) Have a good time.||CC|Okay. And Geno, how are you doing? We've been watching Jack traipse back and forth across the . .||LMP-EVA|I'm getting there, Bob. I'm trying to pit -||CDR-EVA|Talk about seven league boots.||LMP-EVA|Put stem number 2 on.||CC|And, Jack, how's the visibility back at the center geophone ...||LMP-EVA|How's the vis?||CC|Yes. Are you - -||LMP-EVA|Not bad.||CC|Okay. You're not having to worry about the photos yet?||LMP-EVA|No, I've been checking it. Bob, my biggest problem is that the flags don't anchor.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|In general, the lines are following the contours. Whoops - whoops - whoops.||CDR-EVA|Well, try another one. Doggonit.||CC|What's the problem, Geno? It won't screw on?||||Tape 79A/32||||CDR-EVA|Oh, yes. It's no problem. You know, it's the same problem you always have. You get these threads - get a little side force on them and -you know, with the helmet and gloves and what have you - It's just - you can't - Sometimes they go on easy; sometimes they don't.||CC|Copy that.|04 21 50 04|CDR-EVA|Okay. I got this one on now.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|Boy, do I have a ball of spaghetti here. But the geophones are going in the right direction. I hope you don't have an EMI problem. Can the geophone lines cross, Bob?||CC|Stand by on that. Okay; no problem, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Hey, if you see me start to pull over that -module there||CDR-EVA|Hey, don11 do that.||LMP-EVA|No, I mean - oh, I won't hurt it. It's just that it - it stretches the other geophones tight.||CC|Okay. Well, right now we're watching Gene.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Don't worry about it. I'll watch it. The anchors are completely unsuccessful - on the module, anyway.||CC|That looks pretty good, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Not too bad, Bob. The first core was awful loose. I think I could have pulled it back out with my hands.||CC|That's not the idea.|04 21 53 02|CDR-EVA|Oh boy, oh boy. Speaking of boy, oh boy - are you a long way off.||||||Tape 79A/33||CDR-EVA|Okay, going to stop for a second, Bob.||CC|Okay. We've observed your problem there getting the wrench off, Geneo.||CDR-EVA|Well, I had to get down to get that - to get that -third - third stem aligned and get it on there. This is the easy part, but I just got myself behind the power curve for a second.||CC|All right.||LMP-EVA|How's the t ime, Bob ?||CC|Stand by. Okay. Presuming you're taking photos now on geophone 4. Having to finish geophone 4, Jack, you're about - right now, looks like about 15 minutes behind.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|04 21 56 09|CC|And no problem on the time line so far.||CDR-EVA|Darn it. You know, Bob, one of the problems is I'm working in a small crater; and it's just a little difficult to work on these slopes. Okay. It's on. I'm ready to put the drill in.||CC|Okay, Geneo.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me get the dust out of the bit by blurping it. Oh, man; okay. How am I doing, Bob , on the time?|04 21 58 04|CDR-EVA|Jack, do you read me?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, because I don't see you.||LMP-EVA|I'm out by the big rock.||||Tape 79A/34||||CDR-EVA|Oh, okay; I got you. Man, I hope that hole doesn't collapse. I'm going to be awful disappointed. I think I could drive that heat flow flux - or heat flow - or neutron flux in, at least for one probe, without any problem. Okay, Bob, if all goes well in the next few short moments, you'll have the final - unleaded(?) - cores stem - automatic - in this area - on Apollo 17-||CC|On a Monday evening, Roger.||CDR-EVA|Yes, on Monday evening. That is what it is, isn't it? Hey, who's winning the football game?||CC|Stand by; we'll find out.||CC|Okay; and, Jack and Gene, the score is 10 to 10 at the half.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's Oakland and - and who?||CC|Jets.||CDR-EVA|... Kansas City. What am I thinking of?|04 22 03 l4|CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, would you settle for about 8 inches out of the ground? It's about as low as I can get.||CC|Okay - -||LMP-EVA|I haven't heard from them recently.||CC|Okay, Geno. We'll give you A minus for that.||CDR-EVA|I know.||LMP-EVA|There he is.||CC|But it's still an A.||CDR-EVA|Well, I'll go lower if I could get an A plus. But I am going to accept an A minus, because I'll never get the wrench on it if I go any lower.||CC|Roger there , Gene.||||||Tape 79A/35||CDR-EVA|I'm - I'm within an inch of the white stripes. How's that?||CC|That sounds great to me - -||CDR-EVA|An inch of the white stripes, Bob.||CC|Roger. And they're worried up here that you didn't clear the flutes, Geno. You want to tell them that so they'll be happy?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. I'll tell them I did clear the flutes.||CC|Okay. And, Jack, where are you lost on the plains „||CDR-EVA|Yes, I did. But if you want me to do it some more, I will.||CC|No, if you cleared, that's sufficient. And, Jack, where are you lost on the plains of Taurus-Littrow, there?||LMP-EVA|I'm over here.||CDR-EVA|He's 180 from where your camera - from where I am.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Right across the Rover.||CC|Okay. Are you getting ready to take geophone photos or ALSEP photos?||LMP-EVA|I'm getting ready to enable the old geophone.||CC|Okay. I take it that means you've taken the geophone photos.||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes, sir; and I forgot the gnomon (laughter).||CC|(Laughter) Hey, Jack. How about giving me a couple of quick readings here to satisfy some people. One, was there a decal on the LEAM that you aligned it with? There's some controversy down here that there's no decal there; and the||||Tape 79A/36||question is, if there isn't they want a reading out of the degrees. But we keep saying there's a LEAM decal, and we can't prove it.||LMP-EVA|I'll go prove it, Bob. I'll go by there. Stand by.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|What's the other question?||CC|And the second question is, is there a decal and was it aligned on the ... the 20-degree decal on the LSG. Was that also aligned?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|The orange one.||CC|Roger. Agree.||LMP-EVA|As per drawing.||CC|Roger, sir.||LMP-EVA|As per drawing.||CC|Roger. You don't have to prove it to me.||LMP-EVA|Yes, I do.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Okay, Bob, I was able „||CC|Okay; and, Jack, how far - -||CDR-EVA|- - to pull the core out - -||CC|Okay, go ahead.||CDR-EVA|- - with the drill. I was able to pull the core out with the drill, about 3 inches. And it's all jacking material from there out.||||||Tape 79A/37||CC|Okay, copy that, Geno. And we finally got some word from the Cape to prove to people that there's a decal on the LEAM, so you don't have to go back by that, Jack. Just at the right time.||LMP-EVA|I already have. It's reading - it's reading 30. And here's the decal.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I guess I'd take ALSEPs word.||CDR-EVA|Good.||LMP-EVA|One more, Once more I tempt the fate of the god of the cables.||CC|Okay; and, Jack, we're getting ready here to try and save a little bit of time. And we're saying that why don't we just take two stereo pans for the ALSEP photos. First stereo pan will be in the vicinity of the original stereo pan; and the second one, they suggested, will be to the northwest - of that original one.||LMP-EVA|Northwest. Okay.||CC|Yes, and I suggest that you go far enough so that you can see the LEAM past the central station.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, (laughter) you'll be interested to know I just put a - I just put a plug in the top of that core; and it disappeared from sight down the center - center of the core. I'll put a cap on it, too; but I want to plug it first. I want to - I want to get the rammer to plug it down.|04 22 07 43|LMR-EVA|Hey, Bob, where do you want the focus on the panto be?|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 79B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|04 22 08 27|CMP|#NAME?||CC|Roger.||CMP|But I'm sure it isn't that way.||CC|Yes, we've got - -||CC|Ron, if you're right there, we'd like you to take the Hg tank 2 FANs to OFF, please.|04 22 09 42|CMP|Okay. Hg tank 2 FANs to OFF.||CMP|You know, from the pictures of Maraldi Gamma, looked to me like it might have been some sort of a - a - well, maybe even a volcanic dome or some kind. Now when you look at it up there now and compare it with the rest of the surrounding material, it looks just like any other - any of the other sculptured hills. They have small domical structures on it, the same type of material that carries on through south of Maraldi. And it looks like maybe some kind of a mare fill has come in and filled up, Maraldi itself. You can see flow lines, it looks like, going down into Maraldi from Tranquillitatis. Now - The impact on the craters that are inside Maraldi, they're smaller-type craters and they have a - they have a definite bluish tinge to the halo that comes out as opposed to the bright - opposed to the bright craters or white-type thing and those are -have more of a bl - a darkish bluish tin - tinge to them. And - -||CC|Thank you, Ron.||CMP|- - oddly enough, that's the same type of - That's the same type of bluish tinge that I see right in the landing site right now. In the Pentagon complex, MOCR shows up that - that same type of a bluish tinge to it.||||Tape 79B/2||||CC|Roger. Did you have any luck locating the LM area in the landing site this time?||CMP|Yes, I don't even see the bright spot there anymore. I know - I know where to look for it and I don't even see it.||CC|Roger. Understand.|Oh 22 12 30|CMP|Well, South Massif just went into a hole, too, so -||CC|Roger. Our best estimate of their location down here. Ron is - 83 - Delta Mike 83. Delta Mike 83.||CMP|Delta Mike 83, huh?||CC|Yes, and that's - that's seen on the southeast sheet - the FE sheet with the landing site and the first EVA on it. The one, the 25,000 grid map on the - one of those you had put in at the last minute there.|-|CMP|Okay,||CC|And I assume you're set up for these pictures coming up at 121, right?||CMP|Yes. It's funny, I can see Bessel, but I'll be durn if I can see a Copernican ray going across it - I mean a Tycho ray going - Copernican ray, I guess.||CC|I think you were right the first time, weren't you?||CMP|Yes, it's a lycho ray.||CC|Ron, I'm sorry we missed this last time. If you'll give me a hack when you start on the oarth-shine photos on P17s the Copernicus one, I'll -I'll time your 30 seconds for you down here ;md save you looking at the clock. And - -||CMP|Oh, okay. Hey, that's a good idea.||||||Tape 79B/3||CC|I guess even though the start time we passed and everything is the time, Farouk wanted to remind you that when you pass Eratosthenes is a good time to be looking into the heart of Copernicus, there. If you'll remember from the map, there.||CMP|Okay. Hey, that's a good idea; thank you.|04 22 16 28|CC|Were you able to see the Sul- Sulpicius Gallus Ridge there, Ron?||CMP|Yes, man oh man. That thing really sticks up there.||CMP|I'm trying to estimate the height of it with respect to one of those craters down there, but -I - I still can't get over the - the difference in the color and the annulus around Serenitatis. And that thing is really apparent.||CC|Roger.||CMP|And it looks like - the color- - the color distinction - stops right at this ridge here, just as we're going into the sunset right now.||CC|Roger.||CMP|I'm trying to determine a - a flow with respect to those ridges, if there is such a thing.||CMP|I'll have to look at it again when I come around the next time. Okay, Ki - Kilo's got 69 frames.||CC|Roger.|04 22 21 48|CC|Okay, Ron. You're about 2 minutes from T-start time, but again bias your T-start time with respect to the crater Eratosthenes.||CMP|Okay. Why don't you just kind of give me a - ... gouge when I should be at Eratosthenes (chuckle).||CC|Okay. I'll give a call and, of course, your first frame is - -||||Tape 79B/4||||CMP|I think I'11 - -||CC|- - first frame is f/1.2 for 1 second and you'll take two frames.||CMP|Okay.|04 22 23 27|CC|Okay, Ron. You're about 30 seconds from T-start time.|04 22 23 45|CMP|Okay. I think I got her.||CC|Okay, just give me a call when you start. You're about 10 seconds out, now.||CMP|Okay. Stand by 3, 2, 1 -|04 22 23 59|CMP|MARK it.||CMP|Okay; switch to a half.||CC|Okay, coming up on 30 seconds.|04 22 24 27|CC|MARK it.||CMP|Okay, got it. The fourth.||CC|Okay, coming up on another 30 second, here -|04 22 24 57|CC|MARK it.||CMP|Okay. Okay, I'm down to 1/15- I'm just now passing it, Bob. So there's a one on 1/15.||CC|Okay, you're one ahead on the figure. You should be at 1/8 - -||CMP|Two on the 15 - -||CC|#NAME?||CMP|- - I'll start my time from there. Yes, I've -I've already passed it so I had to get them quick (chuckle).||CC|Okay, there you are 1/8 there.||||||Tape 79B/5||CMP|Okay, tell me when to - Okay.||CMP|Okay. The rest of them 1/8?||CC|No, at l/l6 or 1/15-||CMP|Okay. Give me a time hack every 30 seconds.||CC|Well - okay.||CMP|Or whenever, tell me to switch windows.|04 22 26 00|CC|HACK it.||CC|Coming up on 30 seconds.|04 22 26 30|CC|MARK it.||CC|Coming up on another mark, Ron.|04 22 27 00|CC|HACK it.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Just a reminder, the end of this line goes up to Encke and .Kepler; you've probably reviewed that.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Coming up on another mark.|04 22 27 30|CC|HACK.||CC|Coming up on our other mark.|04 22 27 58|CC|MARK it.||CC|Okay, Ron.|04 22 28 30|CC|MARK it.||CMP|Pictures in here. Okay.||CC|Okay, Ron. You'll be coming up on another mark here.||||Tape 79B/6|||04 22 28 57|CC|MARK it.||CMP|Got it.||CC|Okay, according to my calculations you've got two more sets of two frames each to take. You've taken 20 and you've got four more to go, I believe.||CMP|Okay, I want to get some for Reiner Gamma right?||CC|Roger. As soon as you do that, you just switch windows to the north side and - Reiner Gamma -You got two more to go. Here we go. Coming up on another 30 seconds.||CMP|Okay.|04 22 29 29|CC|MARK it. You probably should be able to see Encke out there now. That's your last target there.||CMP|Okay. Switch over to window 3, then.||CC|Okay. Did you take that last one on Encke or you got two more to go on Encke there?||CMP|... I've got - I've only got 19 frames left so -||CC|Okay. That's the last ... it marked there.||CMP|Same thing on the Eratosthenes? Okay.||CC|Okay, Ron. On these Reiner Gamma pictures, you don't have to wait 30 seconds. You just shoot the frames as soon as you get it in view there. Shoot two frames at 1 second, two at 1/2, two at 1/4, and two at 1/8.||CMP|Okay. Would you - would you believe that's what I did on Eratosthenes and also on Copernicus?||CC|Roger. That's what you're supposed to do on Copernicus so you remembered better than me on that one. It wasn't 30 seconds - -||CMP|(Laughter)||||||Tape 79B/7||CC|#NAME?||CMP|Yes. Well, I made a mistake too. I thought Eratosthenes was Copernicus. But anyhow we got -we got a series on Eratosthenes and also a series on Copernicus. So we're in good shape.||CC|Okay. You should be seeing Gamma about now, shouldn't you?||CMP|Yes, but I don't see it yet.||CC|Okay.||CC|Ron, you can just run this mag all the way out to frame 40. After you finish on Gamma, you just continue on out that line up towards Riccioli; and - and then run out to frame 40 and stow it.|04 22 32 19|CMP|Okay; will do.|04 22 36 54|CMP|Okay. Got her in sight now.|04 22 46 48|CC|Okay, Ron. Did you get that mag finished up?||CMP|Okay. All but one picture and I was going to try to take one of Orientale. I've saved one there just for right on the edge.||CC|Okay.||CMP|So I'm just kind of looking out the window now. Why, do you have some Flight Plan stuff?||CC|I've only got one minor Flight Plan and that1s all so any time you're ready, don't - you know, don't tear yourself away from the window as long as you can see anything here.||CMP|Okay.||CC|We would like you to select OMNI Alfa.|04 22 47 30|CMP|OMNI Alfa.||||Tape 79B/8||||CC|And, if you're looking at anything and you can see anything interesting, we wouldn't mind hearing about it.||CMP|Okay.||CMP|The big difference right in here, of course, is the - the ejecta and the radial furrows and ridges and what have you from Orientale - there isn't -doesn't seem to be that type of a pattern at all on the back side.||CC|Ro ger. Underst and.|04 22 50 27|CC|Can you still see - see things in earthshine or is it getting pretty black down there?||CMP|Actually, you know. You can still see it. That's what kind of amazes me. It's almost like - you know, sunrise and sunset.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Pretty soon, the shadows get longer and longer.||CC|I tell you, we got the television screen here of the - -|04 22 51 07|CMP|Okay; that's my last picture off.||CC|Roger. You're going to have a couple of dirty companions when they come back up, I'll tell you.||CMP|(Laughter) What are they doing? Getting all dirty?||CC|Well, I think they've just fallen a couple of times, and they're black all over.||CMP|Yes, it looked like a dark area down there.||CC|"Well, they sure are dirty. Okay, Ron, I - in the Flight Plan at 133:12, way on ahead, you just might mark this down somewhere. It's a real simple -""MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER COVER, OPEN,"" and ""MAPPING CAMERA, EXTEND,"" you'll just delete those since they're already there."||||||Tape 79B/9||CMP|Okay. Let's see - where was that now, about 131, Bob?||CC|133:12. It's in the other volume, in the next volume of the Flight Plan.||CMP|Oh, (chuckle) I'll just write it down, I don't have that volume out.||CC|"Yes, just mapping - it's delete the ""MAPPING CAMERA/LASER ALTIMETER, OPEN,"" and ''MAPPING CAMERA - EXTEND."" Just delete those two functions. You remember it's already out and the cover is staying open because it's out."||CMP|Oh, okay. And that's about 131, huh?||CC|133:12, 133:12.||CMP|Okay. 133 plus 12.||CC|And, Ron. We made a trip around the room here and the CSM systems are all GO. They all look good and the lunar sounder is looking good also.||CMP|Hey. Real fine. I guess I'll grab a bite to eat then here pretty quick.||CC|Yes, do that, will you? Sorry you missed that other one.||CMP|(Laughter) Oh, I filled in, every once in a while so that's not too bad.||CC|Good enough.||CC|And just a reminder, which is in the Flight Plan, DSE voice recorded at the back side will not be dumped - so -||CMP|Oh, okay.||||Tape 79B/10||||CC|And, Ron, the reason why we' OFF, now is we're trying to drop some and we'll come up uration this next half.|'ve got all the H2 FANs, get the pressures to with a sleep config-04 22 '54 12|CMP|Oh, okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 80A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|04 22 07 51|CC|Stand by on that.||LMP-EVA|About 15 feet?||CC|Stand by.||CDR-EVA|Where's my rammer?

Put it - get your foot down on that thing again.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute. Let me - Okay. I jacked the treadle down about 6 inches. Okay. It's loosening up a little bit. I keep saying that, don't I?||CDR-EVA|No. It - it didn't change while I had it there.||CDR-EVA|I can get it. Why don't you go get your - your pan.||LMP-EVA|You got that?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Why don't you get your pan and your - -||LMP-EVA|I've got that. I got - -||CDR-EVA|- - LSPE, and I'll - -||LMP-EVA|I'll get that and a few samples, I guess.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Go aliead and do that. I can get it.||CDR-EVA|Whee. Let me tell you, Red Rover, let me tell you.||LMP-EVA|I know whose face is smiling back there.||LMP-EVA|You don't suppose this is why we didn't have much dust from the LM, do you?||||||Tape 80A/9||CDR-EVA|I think it is (laughter).||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) I saw all the way to the ground during landing.||CDR-EVA|Yes.|04 22 24 24|LMP-EVA|Okay, Houston. Mark it, enabled.||CC|Okay, finally. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Whoops, I moved your an - your central station. I've got to realign on your antenna.||CC|Stand by, Jack. Wait a minute.||LMP-EVA|Well, the gnomon's still aligned. I thought I moved it.||CC|Okay. Well, let it be.||LMP-EVA|Yes. We should have raised the flag on this thing. It looks just the same as when I left it, but I thought I moved it.||CC|Okay, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Is it okay, Bob?||CC|Okay. Leave it alone for right now, Jack, and we'll get a reading on it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|For a minute or so. And, Jack, I guess right now, you might get some fairly rapid samples in the area, since you're probably almost ready to leave. And can you tell us what you saw there in the vicinity of the - you were giving us a description of the boulders there and plateness of the - and alignment of the crystals - the plag. You want to amplify that a little bit?||LMP-EVA|Okay, then. I will as soon as I get back over there with the sample bag. Bag 10 Echo - 10 Echo -is a sample of a very large boulder that's just beyond geopihone 3. Just west - just south.||||Tape 80A/10||||CC|Copy that, 10 Echo, and boulder east of which geophone?||LMP-EVA|South of geophone 3 - southwest. And I got a few photos to doc, here - document the boulder. I'm not sure I documented the sample, though.||CC|Okay, copy that.||LMP-EVA|It - it's a - it's the - the same kind of rock -the same kind of rock I saw near the LM - and the gabbro - I'm beginning to lean towards 50 percent plagioclase, though.||CC|Okay.|04 22 27 13|CDR-EVA|Bob, I had to remove the treadle from the hole and I'll tell you later why.||CC|Okay, go ahead.||CDR-EVA|Oh, me. No, I'll tell you later why. I'm Just figuring, oh me, how am I going to get all this stuff now? I'm going to lose my hole. Okay, it was right there. In our fiasco over here, we knocked everything over.||LMP-EVA|Did I ruin something?||CDR-EVA|No, I've Just got to stoop over to get things and that's a major - major - effort these days.||LMP-EVA|Can I help you?||CDR-EVA|No, I got it here. I've got a delicate core in one hand, and I'm trying to get some core caps in the other. You'd be glad to know it's full, Bob. And while I'm the only one to see the bottom end right now, I'm going to tell you, it - it looks like - it looks like what I'm walking on, but it's obviously now powdery. It's obviously very - very cohesive, because it - it - The bottom of the core is not smooth, it's very jaggedy, and fragmental-like.||CC|Okay, copy that, Geno. Very good.||||||Tape 80A/11||CDR-EVA|Yes. I'm - I'm being very careful with your core here, but I've got to do a few - little housektiepi.nf; chores first.||CC|Okay. Have you got that neutron flux over there in the vicinity, or is it still back at the Rover?||CDR-EVA|No, sir, I already got it.||CC|Okay, good enough.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I've been looking.||CC|And Jack, in your travels there, while you're doing some sampling, if you hap - happen to wander by in the vicinity - approximate vicinity of the double core - the deep core, you might get us a Rover sample of the soil there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Bob - Bob, and - the core is filled to within a - an eighth or certainly less than a quarter of an inch from the - from the bit.||CC|Okay. Sounds good to me. Sounds like a good -good candidate for a cap.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, and it's got Bravo on and the plug has been discarded.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Now, let me see what else I can get here, before I get too upset. I need my - my - the - the - the drill, besides performing admirably, is a tool of necessity to lean over and pick things up with. Except when you let it fall down.||CC|Okay. And our next priority is to put the neutron flux down the hole, we hope.||CDR-EVA|Well, we shall see. Man, I don't even know if I can find the hole. It's in the shadow now. I guess I can see it down there. There it is. Okay. You asked, and with a little bit of luck, you shall receive.||||Tape 80A/12||||CDR-EVA|Listen, I'm earning my three and a quarter a day today. Oh, boy, I don't want to lose the rammer either. Let me get that before that gets lost in the shuffle. We don't want to lose that for sure.|04 22 31 07|CDR-EVA|I bet you all think I'm stepping on that hole, don't you?||CC|I don't. John doesn't, either.||LMP-EVA|Bob, I see no - no clear alignment of plagioclase or pyroxene in this rock. That's the one with the parting in it. It looks as if - integrating what I've seen here and over at the big rock - the geophone rock - I - that the layering or the foliation or the parting, whichever it is, is the result of variations in vesicle concentrations. The sample 10 Echo is a sample of the more coarsely vesicular rock. I could not get one of the finer - more finely or nonvesicular fragments. But I got pictures of it.||CC|Okay, copy that. And do you see any - any - -||LMP-EVA|I'm having trouble - -||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||CC|Can you see any evidence of soil on top of some of these medium-sized boulders?||LMP-EVA|There's soil. A little bit of dust in some of the holes. But I - there's not enough to sample at this point. I may find some later.||CC|Okay, copy that. He's picking up ...||LMP-EVA|Vesicle walls do not seem to be as shiny. Most of them seem to have dust in them.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|The vesicler; are not cleanly spherical - they're spherical but they have fairly rough outlines. They look as if there's been some recrystallization.||||||Tape 80A/13||CC|All right.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I will ver - verify that the lower section is on.||CC|Okay, thank you, Geno.||LMP-EVA|I picked the wrong rock to sample with a scoop, I'll tell you that.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I'll tell you, housekeeping is the key to the world right now.||CC|Okay, Geno and - let's - -||CDR-EVA|Okay, another key to the world is one of - -||CC|Geno, stand by. Hold it.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CC|Okay, make sure that the top of it doesn't go down through the hole, too, and disappear, either by putting it through the treadle, or if you're sure this the - or whatever.||CDR-EVA|Boy, Bob, that sure is a good thought. You know, I had to take the treadle off because the jack wouldn't go down and no way I could put that treadle - Well, let me turn it on first. That was a good thought. It may - it may go down that hole That would be terrible.||CC|How big's the hole look, Geno?||CDR-EVA|See, the jack wouldn't - Well, looks big enough to put this down. Let me - let me use my judgment on it. And a little ingenuity.||CDR-EVA|I verified the top was on, by the way.||CC|Okay, thank you.|04 22 35 27|CDR-EVA|Shazam!||CC|How about that, loud applause, loud applause.||||Tape 80A/14||||CDR-EVA|See what happened, here, to that treadle, Bob. I couldn't get the jack to go down and it - it - it made the hole oblong when I - but it's all right now.||CC|Okay; beautiful, beautiful.||CDR-EVA|And it ended up all right.||CC|Okay. And why don't we get you two guys together again, now, and break down the core and press on. And we've got a little revision here to the EVA. I'll get with you in just minute on, as soon as I|||find out what it is.||CDR-EVA|Bob, I feel pretty good about that - that - that makes me feel pretty good.||LMP-EVA|Bag 174 - 474, 474, soil from next to this big rock, it's the fillet. I can't get a chunk of the rock.||CC|Copy; 17^é fillet beside the big rock. And, Jack, while you coming back here to the Rover, why don't you get one more Rover sample in the vicinity of the deep drill, while you and Gene get ready to take on the core stems. And because of being a little bit behind here, what we're doing is, we're getting prepared to drop station 1 in favor od doing Steno. Over. And I'll get with you on more details on that in a minute.||LMP-EVA|Well, how far behind are we?||CC|Stand by. You're about - between 35 and 40 minutes. And part of the problem is that we're a little short on oxygen on Gene's PLSS. It looks like it's a 6 minute and 4-6 hours and 45 minute EVA from that point of view, which means that we have to -we'd have to leave station 1 too early, which is another - which is the reason to curtail station 1 apart from just behind which is what the hooker was.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm approaching the rear of the Rover. I've got the core, the cap, the wrench, and the rammer.||||||Tape 80A/15||CC|Okay-||CDR-EVA|I didn't mean to breathe up all that oxygen.||CC|Well, there's something you can't help. Even the Surgeon agrees with me on that one. And for your thinking, Jack and Gene, what we're doing is planning on going to the west side of Steno and that boulder field that's part way out to station 1.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you want me to get a - you want to break that and I'll go get this sample, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I'll - I'll break this Jack; no sweat.||LMP-EVA|Gene has pretty well chewed up the ground. I helped him. Do you want me to get a little ways away from it?||CC|Stand by. I don't think we're interested in a surface sample in the last top little bit ring, it's just a - in the top - just a surface sample. Stand by 1.||CC|Anything there in the dirt, Jack. It doesn't have to be a skim sample of any sort.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm breaking down the core at the tail end of the Rover, here.||CC|Okay, c ongratulat i ons.||CDR-EVA|Well, don't do it yet, I haven't gotten it broken down yet. But I got it out of the ground with a little help.||CDR-EVA|Okay, first piece of three sections - Bob, it's full.||CC|Okay, beautiful.||CDR-EVA|And I have to tell you which end I'm taking it from. I don't remember which end I've got here.||CC|That's all right, since we got the cap and Alfa on one end and Bravo on the other end - Bravo.||||Tape 80A/16||||CDR-EVA|Man! There's a cap that's going to be tough to get on. I put that on with a hammer. Oh, boy.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, there's a mixture of soil and rock in **75.||CC|Okay, copy 475-||LMP-EVA|The soil came from about - the soil came from about 5 centimeters - 0 to 5 centimeters.||CC|Okay, copy that. Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|And it's about 3 meters - 3 meters - 3 meters from the hole. Well -||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, cap Charlie is opposite Alfa, that was the first 3-section.||CC|Okay, copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, it's about 3 meters from the hole. I got stereo before with - at 11 feet and one after at 11 feet.||CC|Okay, copy that. And how about a frame count there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Stand by.||CDR-EVA|I tell you.||CDR-EVA|No - no, I can get it. Boy, this system works good.||LMP-EVA|Okay, let me see. Let me configure the old LRV sampler, here.||CC|Jack, when you - -||LMP-EVA|Oh - -||CC|J ack, when you - -||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy, oh, boy; oh, boy; oh, boy.||CC|Jack, this is Houston. Over.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.||||||Tape 80A/17||CC|When you took those two pans off the ALSEP, was one at 15 feet and one at 20 feet?||LMP-EVA|One was at focus for 15 and 74.||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|There's a partial pan - there's a partial pan on mag A, which was taken at 15-||CC|Okay. Understand.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob - I can't see what it is - I guess Delta and Echo is the - the 2-section core. Delta being adjacent to the first section of 3-|04 22 43 08|CC|Roger. Copy that, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Okay, baby, just go on there - nice. The last -the last one is Foxtrot. And it's on tight.||CDR-EVA|Ouch.||LMP-EVA|Arm's tired?||CDR-EVA|That hurts. Oh, me; oh, my. I'm going to take a big drink of water here. We got three cores; we got the neutron flux down; and we got two heat probes, and an ALSEP. I don't care if we are 30 minutes late. Bob, did I give you the last cap?||CC|That's okay, Gene. We don't really need it - the way they're broken down, there's no problem. The 323 stands out and the Bravo on the bit end -there's no problem there.||CDR-EVA|Hey -||LMP-EVA|What do you need, babe? Okay, pull that off. Pull this off. Here.||LMP-EVA|Rotate it 180, there.||CDR-EVA|No, no, no, just the - the total thing. That's good. There you go.||LMP-EVA|Like that?||||Tape 80A/18||||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CC|Okay, and, 17 - -||CDR-EVA|Now you'll have to line it up.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll hold it. You do it.||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|... give you a reading, Bob, before you speak. Wait a minute, let me - let me get it over with. It's 670, 002, 601. That's 670, 002, 601.||CC|Did you punch GRAV a second time? That's identical to the first one.||CDR-EVA|You just did to read it. That's what you want, isn't it?||CC|Yes, is that - but you - did you punch GRAV after the first reading you gave me there at the ALSEP? Or are you just reading me the same measurements you did before?||CDR-EVA|Bob, I called them out every time - Bob, I'm reading it right here. Everywhere I've punched GRAV, you've got it written down somewhere.||CC|Yes, and I didn't copy your punching GRAV, but the one - -||CDR-EVA|Bob, I did not - when I went back - Bob, I did not -when I went to get the treadle and the neutron flux and rammer, I did not punch GRAV.||CC|Okay. So that's the same as the first one. Never mind, thank you. And guys - we're ready for you guys - as you go along here, to do the geo prep and press on. As I say, we'll go to Steno and come back from there and do the SEP. Over. Any questions about that? We'd also like to know if you have the gnomon, back of the Rover?||||||Tape 80A/19||CDR-EVA|Yes, we're just - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, we do.||CDR-EVA|Okay, lay cores in. Okay - -||LMP-EVA|Can you - can you put that in that sampler tool bag, there?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. We're configuring for geology, now, Bob.||CC|Okay, copy that.|04 22 46 44|CDR-EVA|Bob, right now, 10 Echo is in my suit pocket, I hope.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, my 20-bag dispenser is SCB 1. Let me get at them.||LMP-EVA|I've got mine on.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Oh.||LMP-EVA|This probably goes under the seat, doesn't it?||CDR-EVA|The camera - where the devil mine is - where the devil mine is. Excuse me. Oh, I see the gnomon.||LMP-EVA|I put it there so I wouldn't forget it.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) Okay, I tell you, dexterity is the key. We might leave - Look at those cover gloves.||LMP-EVA|I guess we can take those off. I don't know whether we ought to or not.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to leave mine on for a while. I changed my mind. I want to look at my gloves before I take them off. Okay, where are we? You got your camera, obviously. This is ray camera. I got the bag dispenser on it. It's not a bad day's start. Bob, is the ALSEP working good?||CC|The last we heard, it was working great, guys. We'll check again, though.||||Tape 80A/20||||CDR-EVA|Okay. You got your camera. My camera is in the floor pan. Cap dispenser, SCB to Gate 1. Let me get that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|You haven't been on the Rover yet. It's real easy, but it's also very easy to kick dust all over those battery covers, so don't even get on it until I put those bat covers down.||LMP-EVA|Yes - Hey - I guess - I should - we ought to press on as if we're going to station 1.||CDR-EVA|Yes, you've got to walk - you got to walk back to the LM anyway - I got to - we got to - -||CC|Roger. Guys, we are going to play it per the checklist. Jack will carry the things back. Gene will get the thing aligned. We'll go out to the SEP site. And then we'll press on from there down to Steno. Over.||CDR-EVA|Okay, very good.||CC|And right now -||CDR-EVA|Okay. Stow LMP - you want to come over here and I'll stow your PLSS?||CC|Go ahead. Never mind.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Jfy camera's under my feet.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you can turn around. Oh, man, what have you been in? Hallelujah.||CDR-EVA|I'll keep the hammer, I'll give you this. Can you reach the rammer? It's right in front of you. On the - -||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes.||CDR-EVA|Let me - I haven't got that cap in, yet - there it is. Okay, the caps are in. If we ever come out here again, I want to get your hammer, here ...||||||Tape 80A/21||CC|... you might give us a frame count on Hotel.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob.||CC|And we're going to hand over stations. You might get a dropout.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it's under the seat right now. I'm - Okay, rammer - I got the hammer. Turn around. I'll give you a SCB 2.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Now, guess who's watching to see how these hooks are going to work?||LMP-EVA|Oh, man. Like a charm, so far.||CDR-EVA|Oh, except your doggone harness of off, too, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Is it?||CDR-EVA|Yes .||LMP-EVA|Okay, you've got to undo the strap - -||CDR-EVA|Let me - let me get at it.||LMP-EVA|You got to loosen that strap and then just put her underneath, and tighten it up again.||CDR-EVA|This one here?||LMP-EVA|The one on - the one on my right. Yes.||CDR-EVA|Now - let me turn around then. I got to get on your - oh, on your right. Right here.||LMP-EVA|I think it is - Yes. That's where it is on yours.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'd like to make sure the other side is all right, though.||LMP-EVA|Oh, okay.||CDR-EVA|Let me - Yes, it's all right. Turn around. Let me just get it underneath.||||Tape 80A/22|||04 22 51 l4|LMP-EVA|I got it so tight now, the Rover - Okay, now.||CDR-EVA|I got it on.||LMP-EVA|Okay?||CDR-EVA|Okay, now, I'll get this hook. That hook's going to be a piece of cak.e, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Keep it in, and it's all on and locked.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you got a SCB 2. You got the rammer. You got a cap dispenser.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You can secure SCB 1. Doesn't this go under your - -||LMP-EVA|Not yet, I don't think. I think it stays there.||CDR-EVA|This does. No - -||LMP-EVA|That does. Yes. That goes under the seat.||CDR-EVA|And this goes here.||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Bob, the long can's going under my seat.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Jack.||CDR-EVA|They got a handover, I think.||CC|Handover's complete, guys.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|*** which way it unlocks, though.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you can pull it off.||LMP-EVA|It's unlocked.||CDR-EVA|It's unlocked. There it is. It's usually stiff. Okay. For once, I have my camera off.||||||Tape 80A/23||CDR-EVA|Did you get the heat-flow pictures, by the way?||LMP-EVA|I got most of them. Not all of them. They revised the whole camera.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, is it going to hurt to leave the UHT in the heat-flow electronics?||CC|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|Wait a minute. I ought to get that, I guess.||LMP-EVA|One - tall.||CDR-EVA|Here, let me lean down.||LMP-EVA|Two, and the hook's still hooked. Check for sure. Those hooks weren't designed for new bags.||CC|Okay, Jack - -||LMP-EVA|Okay. I think that will ride all right.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|They don't want us there. If you - if one of you guys can get to it and pull it out.||CDR-EVA|I'll get it right now.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Watch the alignment, as you said.||CDR-EVA|Yes. I sort of thought you might like it out of there. Let's stay away so I don't get a cable and I don't get dust in the mirror. The alignment is still good.|04 22 53 48|CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Now, if I can get it out. Okay, I'm going back to the LM.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, the alignment's good on the heat flow, and I've got the UHT out. Jack, do you need this?||||Tape 80A/24||||LMP-EVA|You better leave - save it. Save it.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to leave it right here by the ALSEP.||LMP-EVA|Save it. Careful.||CDR-EVA|Jeeminy, I just threw it right here in this little -little ditch.||LMP-EVA|Yes, right. Okay, the other UHT is by the ALSEP. We probably ought to have it with us, Geno. For the sampler.||CC|Have you got one - -||CDR-EVA|Well, you've got one - -||CC|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|Yes. That's all right. Keep it on the ...||CC|Okay, we gather you're on the way back to the LM with the core stems there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CC|Okay.|04 22 54 44|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm going to take the TV away from you and get these battery covers squared away before I put the tongs and the camera on.|04 22 54 53|CC|Okay, Geno, and you guys have the gnomon in the little quiver, right?|04 22 55 00|CDR-EVA|Yes, sir. The temperatures on the batteries are 96 and 110.||CC|Okay, thank you.||CDR-EVA|Can I close the covers?||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Can I close the covers?||CC|Roger; Roger.||||||Tape 80A/25||CDR-EVA|Hey, you're turning our voice around, Bob.||CC|No, I said - -||CDR-EVA|We're getting a repeat.||CC|"I said, ""Close the covers, please."""||CDR-EVA|That's right. I heard what you said, but you're turning our voice around.||LMP-EVA|(Singing) I was strolling on the Moon one day -||LMP/CDR-EVA|- in the merry, merry month of December -||CDR-EVA|No, May.||LMP-EVA|May.||CDR-EVA|May's the month this year.||LMP-EVA|May - that's ri ght.||CDR-EVA|May is the year, the month.||LMP-EVA|(Singing) When much to my surprise, a pair of bonny eyes - be-doop-doo-doo - -||CC|Sorry about that, guys, but today may be December.||CDR-EVA|Okay, the battery cover - -||LMP-EVA|(Humming) Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dee-da-dee - -|04 22 56 17|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, the battery covers are closed. I'm ready to go MODE switch 1. I guess I'll just wave goodby. You look pretty clean, so I won't touch you.||CC|Okay, thank you.|04 22 56 36|CDR-EVA|Oh, man. It's even hard to move you counterclockwise. Here we go. Counterclockwise, facing aft. Okay, I'm going to go MODE switch number 1. Okay, we're MODE switch number 1 - -||||Tape 80A/26|||04 22 56 56|CC|Roger. We can confirm that.||CDR-EVA|- - and you want me to leave those two blankets open 100 percent, right?||CC|Roger, That's affirm.||CDR-EVA|Okay, now I got - now I got to mount my camera and tether my tongs. Boy, Jack, I can bare - I can't see you at all. Looking into the east is terrible. All I can tell you is that there's a LM there.|04 22 57 24|CDR-EVA|Okay, mount camera, tether tongs. See if my camera's going to work. Bob, I'm on - on Bravo -mag Bravo and frame count 19.||CC|Okay; copy that, Gene.|04 22 57 50|CDR-EVA|And for EMU status, I can give you about 36 percent, no flags, 3.85, and I'm on - I'm still INTERMEDIATE cooling.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, inventory. Camera, tongs, gnomon. Okay, I'm ready to get on. Ready to get on.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you want us to take the - Ouch! That rock by your front porch is really a major nuisance.||CDR-EVA|Oh, doggone it.||LMP-EVA|What's the problem?||CDR-EVA|Oh! Every time I get on, I get dust around. I still haven't learned how to get on yet. You'd think after three times, I'd know better. I know better, but it's - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, I've got the transmitter. I'm heading west -or east. (Laughter) Heading east. Sorry about that. (Humming)|04 22 59 11|CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm PRIMARY. Okay, you want a nav initialise here, huh, Houston?|\|CC|Th at' s af fi nnat i ve.||||||Tape 80A/27||CDR-EVA|By the way, Bob, station 6 is pretty obvious up on the hill. It's fairly high up.

Thinking you can see the boulder and that's how you can tell, right?||CDR-EVA|Yes. And the crater. A shame not to - Well, maybe that's the wrong one. I'll have to check the map. A shauie not to go to station 1. Sure is a shame. Why don't you consider station 1 as a possibility? Okay, Bob, let me give you some numbers.||CC|We're ready.|04 23 00 13|CDR-EVA|Sun shadow is zero. I am rolled right 4 degrees. I am pitch zero.

Copy that, Jack.||||Tape 80A/28||||LMF-EVA|I'm at the SEP site, and I found a place I think we can lay out a pretty good grid.||CC|Okay, Jack, and when you lay it down there, we want to put it down with the gnomon side, the side you're going to face, you want to put that facing away from the Sun. We found out a thermal constraint this evening, just as the EVA started.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Away from the Sun. Gnomon - you want the gnomon side or corner?||CC|The gnomon side away from the Sun. That's those -the side with the solar panel has to be away from the Sun. The sides with the solar panel ... to be in the shade.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|04 23 03 31|CDR-EVA|Bob, everything's working fine so far. She's zeroed ard I'm torqued. And I'm ready to press on. RESET is back OFF. Okay, Jack, here I come.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You see me?||CDR-EVA|No, I'm facing the other way.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I tell you - just about all you can see in that direction is the LM. Boy, that's tough driving into the Sun!||LMP-EVA|Go right to the LM, and then a little bit to your left, to the left of the LM.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I've got to go to the LM and give them a reading here.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|That' s affirmative, Gene.||CDR-EVA|You get that - that shadow up there and you're all right.||CDR-EVA|Say again, Bob?||||||Tape 80A/29||CC|That's affirmative. We want the range and bearing at the LM. I'm glad you remembered.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, I'll give it to you. I even got - Oh, oh, don't get in there. Whoo! I even got the low gain working for you. I don't know if you're using it.||CC|I think we're using the LM right now.||CDR-EVA|Boy, that LM is pretty. Whoo!||LMP-EVA|Bob, everything I've seen so far indicates that the so-called subfloor boulders, if we have gotten that deep, are this gabbro. I'm out here at the SEP site, and the large blocks are still the plagioclase pyroxene - -||CDR-EVA|Jack, let me give them a range. I'll be on my way out.||LMP-EVA|Go ahead.|04 23 05 45|CDR-EVA|Okay, bearing 292, 0.2, and 0.2. I'm standing right in front of the MESA.||CC|Okay. Beautiful, Geno. Thank you.|04 23 06 00|CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm coming, Jack.||LMP-EVA|The zap pits are nice white halos, although, for the most part, the rock's too coarse to show them very well. Some of the larger ones have white halos. We may not be down to the subfloor, but -it's hard to say.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Bob, making 8 to 10 kilometers, and I'm barely moving.||CDR-EVA|Where've you got the SEP, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Right out over there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me give them a bearing, distance, and range, and some numbers here. Meet you over there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 80A/30||||CDR-EVA|Oh!||LMP-EVA|Bob, I did see a dense gray rock that's different than the others on my traverse out here. We'll try to find some of that, too.|04 23 07 12|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I'm reading 278, 003, and 003 at the SEP site.||CC|Okay. Copy that, Geno. And how about giving me amp-hours and batteries just as long as you're there?|04 23 07 30|CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, it's coming at you. Amp-hours are 112 and 110; batteries are 9-92 and about 1 -about 112.||CC|Okay, copy that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Motors are all off scale low. ~||CC|Yes, okay thank you.|04 23 07 54|CDR-EVA|NAV is going to RESET.||CC|Say again there, Gene. You're going to go to RESET, right?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir; going to RESET.|04 23 08 04|CC|Okay. Jack, you can be getting on. You won't need a bomb* and I guess you won't need the LMP camera unless you want it. We'll be deploying the bomb at Steno.||LMP-EVA|(Laughter) I thought we were playing it by the checklist, Geno. Here's the bomb.||CDR-EVA|Okay, give it to me.||LMP-EVA|The charge.||CDR-EVA|I've got it.||CC|Yes, it just happens that the station is at the place we're going to deploy the charge.||||||Tape 80A/31||LMP-EVA|Okay, well, we got it off.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Do you know which aide of Steno he wants us to go, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Not yet.||CC|Yes. We're going - Okay, let me fill you in on the plan, guys. We're going to go to the west side of Steno, -which is where you would have driven by anyway, and the stop is - will be at the 340/1.2, which is where you've got the little Delta for EP 6, in your checklist. And we will plan on spending about 30 minutes there sampling primarily boulders.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Geno, west side of Steno there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got it here. Okay - -||LMP-EVA|You got a good feeling on how to head out of here?||CDR-EVA|Yes. I want to get around the back side - now that I'm down there, on the back side of Trident, and make sure that that's what I'm looking at, is Trident over there.||LMP-EVA|Okay, let me try to get on this thing.||CC|Okay. And, 17, just to fill you in a little bit more here. We're looking at a 6 plus 45 EVA. We've given you 15 minutes to drive to station 1; 30 minutes at station 1; and 15 minutes to drive back to the SEP, and then deploying the SEP for 22 minutes. And then a 40-minute closeout at 6 plus 45.||CDR-EVA|I'm sorry, Bob. After 30 minutes at station 1, what did you say?||CC|Okay. Then we're going to drive back. There's a 15-minute return to the SEP site, and then 22 minutes at the SEP site to deploy the SEP, and then return to the LM in 45 minutes for the closeout.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Understand.||||Tape 80A/32||||CDR-EVA|Okay, you strapped in?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we've got to start getting on this Rover facing 90 degrees to the seats, I think.||LMP-EVA|I did the same thing.||CDR-EVA|Right through dust?||LMP-EVA|Yes, we both did. I tried to knock it all off my feet.||CDR-EVA|Yes. That's impossible. Okay, Jack. Let's see if we can't get around - around Trident East over here.||LMP-EVA|Well, I don't - I wish I didn't have this charge. If they played it by the checklist - I wasn't paying attention. Okay - -|04 23 11 02|CDR-EVA|We're on the move, Bob.||LMP-EVA|Okay, this is Trident, isn't it? So we're starting out - ~||CDR-EVA|Yes. It's got to be.||LMP-EVA|Yes. So, you're starting out on the - You really want to hit about 29 - -||CDR-EVA|No, no, no.||LMP-EVA|No, wait a minute. Where are we?||CDR-EVA|We want to go southeast.||LMP-EVA|181 - -||CC|17, we'll start out on the same general traverse that you've been on. It's just that we'll stop it sooner.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we understand.||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 80A/33||LMP-EVA|We're just getting our bearings, Bob.||CDR-EVA|This has got to be Trident East, right, right here, Jack. See that? That's got to be Trident East. That's the big one.||LMP-EVA|On the right or the left?||CDR-EVA|On the right.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|And we - and Poppy - and was just over about where - -||LMP-EVA|Watch your -||CDR-EVA|Yes. I just want to get our bearings here. You can't look to the east.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I've got to - That's an awful big depression over there, isn't it? Says go along this way.||CDR-EVA|Boy, it sure is. Wheel||LMP-EVA|Watch it. Ho - ho - ho hold it, held it, hold it!||CDR-EVA|Got it, got it, got it .. .||LMP-EVA|Boy, I tell you I've got to get out east.||CDR-EVA|Stand by.||LMP-EVA|Gene, I think - I'm going to head about 120 out of here.||CDR-EVA|Well, it's a -||LMP-EVA|You've got another hole on your right here.||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|Whoa, whoa. I'm not sure what's wrong. Why don't you go left there?||CDR-EVA|Okay.||||Tape 80A/34||||LMP-EVA|Go left around this thing.||CC|And, 17; Houston. For your advice, we're trying to use the low gain antenna on this traverse also. Might try and be good guys and turn it for us when you have to.|04 23 13 05|LMP-EVA|Okay. Bob.||CC|That's general reminder number 1.||LMP-EVA|Gene, I think we need to head south.||CDR-EVA|Yes. We've got to go out here southeast. What's that big map look like in relation to Bare Mountain to you?||LMP-EVA|You mean the - I'm not sure I can get to it. Okay. Okay, I won't - -||CDR-EVA|It calls for 116 at 0.62 - -||LMP-EVA|... near the SEP. I ended up with this charge in my hand. There's a big - What are you headed now, south pretty much?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|I think you're getting - That must be station -that must be Emory over there. See with all the blocks in the wall?||CDR-EVA|Where you looking? Which way?||LMP-EVA|Southeast. Way over there.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|That may very well go - this is very easily Steno right over here. Let's - let's see, we're between the two big ones - that would be - -||CDR-EVA|That would be Powell.||LMP-EVA|That would be Powell on the right.||||||Tape 80A/35||CDR-EVA|You think?||LMP-EVA|Certainly doesn't look like th LNA yet.||CDR-EVA|No, it sure doesn't.||CC|How about a range and bearing, guys, I think we can help you.||CDR-EVA|Okay, 330, 0.3.||CC|Okay, it sounds like you're probably just driving by the East Trident or Trident 3.|04 23 14 45|LMP-EVA|You think all that right there is Trident?||CDR-EVA|gosh, if it is, that's incredible. I - I -That's hard to believe.||LMP-EVA|Well, there - you're going to go in a hole with your right - No problem.||CDR-EVA|I can't see the lip too well because of the - -||LMP-EVA|Well, if that's Trident -||CC|Okay. And, Jack, if you - do you have your camera on - -||LMP-EVA|Boy, I wish ...||CC|- - If so, could you give me a frame count some time?||LMP-EVA|Bob, I got my hands full with this charge.||CC|Oh, okay, forgot about that one. Sorry about that.||LMP-EVA|Looks like 45.||CC|Okay, copy that. Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Boy, if that's Trident, whoo!||CDR-EVA|Hey, you know that is - don't you suppose that's Trident?||||Tape 80A/36||||LMP-EVA|Well, it sure looks like it, doesn't it?||CDR-EVA|Yes. We were quite a ways from Trident.||LMP-EVA|I bet you it is.||CDR-EVA|If that's true, we're at 3^2.4. That's about right; we're half a mile - that's about right. Boy, what I was looking at Trident isn't nearly that - any where near that big.||LMP-EVA|Okay, if that's true, then we want to go - -||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||LMP-EVA|#NAME?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir, we're all right now. That's got to be Trident. Wjt we were looking at before - I've got to stop and see what that is. I've got to look at those maps when we get in.|04 23 16 12|LMP-EVA|Well, it's a triplet all right, with some septar between. Well, wish I could take pictures. Take a few, but - -||CDR-EVA|Well, let me get a few here.||LMP-EVA|No. You keep pressing. We can get them coming back.||LMP-EVA|Take a few, but it's not continuous. My hands are giving out. I wish I hadn't said follow the checklist. Okay, we're at 0.5 and 346. And the surface has not really changed except slightly more hummocky and rolling, because of a larger number of irregular depressions, or craters. The - boom! -the rocks at first glance from the Rover look very much like what we had around the LM. That's the big ones.|04 23 17 21|CC|And, 17, you might be - -||LMP-EVA|There are occasional - -||CC|- - Jack, you might be expecting WATER flag and a tone in a couple of minutes, to go to AUX.||||||Tape 80A/37||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|And CDR will be about 5 minutes after that.||CDR-EVA|I'll get stopped here in a minute, Jack - as scon as I get -||LMP-EVA|Okay. I think maybe that might be Steno over there -||CDR-EVA|I don't think we're too far off.||LMP-EVA|Okay, there' s my - I' ve got to go to AUX.||CDR-EVA|Can you reach it?||LMP-EVA|I hope so.|04 23 18 09|LMP-EVA|Okay, Houston, do you see me in AUX?||CC|Stand by. Roger. We see you in AUX.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to hit some of these broadside, Jack, and then we won't get any roll angle.||LMP-EVA|Okay, how far have you come?||CDR-EVA|I've got to go 0.7 - about another 0.7 mi -kilometers. I may be coming up on the edge of it. I don't know, I may - I'm on the right bearing. Yes. We're all right. Steno has got a dimple on the north. Boy, this is a heck of a way to start out our navigation because it's into the cross-Sun here - not cross-sun - but Sun. Now, that's got to be Powell, wouldn't you say?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Must be.||CDR-EVA|Must be.||LMP-EVA|Listen, you - -||CDR-EVA|Then that's Steno with all the blocks in it.||LMP-EVA|Boy, an I glad we didn't land out here! Whew!||||Tape 80A/38||||CDR-EVA|See this high point up here coming ahead?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|That should give us our bearings, I hope.||LMP-EVA|I can't hold that bomb any longer.||CDR-EVA|What are you going to do with it?||LMP-EVA|I'm going to drop it at my feet.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Okay, it's there.||CDR-EVA|Keep it between your feet.||LMP-EVA|It will, VSy hands aren't going to be any good for sampling.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's Powell, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes.|04 23 19 53|LMP-EVA|Okay, if that's Powell. Quite a ways over there, but I think the thing to do is get up on that little ridge there.|04 23 20 03|CDR-EVA|I think we may end up looking right into Steno when we get up there. Bob, we're 342.9-||CC|Okay. Copy that.||CC|3-0 and 1 - -||CDR-EVA|Are you reading the low gain, by the way?||CC|Yes. Roger. Beautiful. 340 and 1.2 is what we expect the station to be.||CC|And it should be up on the top of a little bit of a rise. That you see coming up there. Almost to that rise. You ought to be in the vicinity of some very large boulders.||||||Tape 80A/39||CDR-EVA|Houston, there's a - there are certainly a lot of big boulders - Whoops! Let me take a look into the Sun here. That doesn't look what I thought Steno looked like. There's no dip there. 1.2 he said. All right. This is it over here, though, I guess.||CC|Yes, Steno ought to be at - right at your 9 o'clock there, Gene.||CDR-EVA|At my 9 o'clock. Yes.||CC|Either that or your 3 o'clock. I forgot which one it is.||LMP-EVA|How do you know where we are?||CDR-EVA|I think, you're probably right, although it doesn't impresss me as what I saw in the LNA. How much time have we got to drive now, Bob?||CC|Okay5 stand by.||CDR-EVA|I think that's probably Emory up there.||LMP-EVA|That's Steno, I guess.||CC|Yes, yes, Steno - Gene and Jack, we'd like you to -If you're in the vicinity, we think you're just about there. We were planning on you leaving the SEP and getting to this place at about 4 plus 58 and we're showing about 5 plus 00 right now so you're right on time. And if you're at 340 and 1.2 in that vicinity, you must be at the station or very close to it where you can see. Over.||CDR-EVA|Well, it doesn't look real familiar, Bob, as far as Steno's concerned.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I got - I think they can locate us if we work that block field right there.||CDR-EVA|Let me get my water.||CC|Okay, on the map we're showing, Jack, that you're probably looking at, you're seeing that there's a couple of boulders at - just above - at about the -With north being 12 o'clock, there are a couple of boulders at about the 09:30 position on Steno.||||Tape 80A/40|||||And then there's a couple of more at about the 9 o'clock position on Steno. And we're putting the station right in the midst of all those boulders. Over.||CDR-EVA|Well, Bob, I don't know. It's hard - hard to follow that that's where we are. I'm not sure. It doesn't look like what I expected Steno to look like - -||LMP-EVA|No, me neither.||CC|Okay. What's the range and bearing one more time?|04 23 23 03|CDR-EVA|Okay, 346; 1.1. I think it would almost be worth -I bet that's Emory up on that hill. It's got to be.||LMP|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, well, let's - -||LMP-EVA|We better park in this boulder field here.||CDR-EVA|... boulder field.||LMP-EVA|Wish we could have gotten near one of the big ones, but let's do it. We're going to run out of time.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CC|That's affirmative, guys - -||CDR-EVA|... big one anyway.||LMP-EVA|Okay. You want me - -||CC|- - There's no point in deviating around and spending 15 minutes trying to get a particular spot or down to a bigger boulder. You must be in the near vicinity. If you're really worried about it, I guess you might drive a little bit to the east to the rim ||LMP-EVA|Okay. We got - -||||||Tape 80A/41||CC|- - crater, unless you're there. Over. Your judgment.||LMP-EVA|No, we're okay. We got a good place.||CC|All right.|04 23 24 02|CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm parked - I'm parked 180.||CC|Roger. Stand by on that a minute.||CDR-EVA|You want us to get off? What do you mean?||CC|Okay. No - -||CDR-EVA|What heading?||CC|- - Okay. I was just wondering about where you were going to park. Go ahead and park 180. There was a question on whether they wanted us to park into the Sun, but don't worry.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm heading - -||CC|180 is a good heading.|04 23 24 27|CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm headed -I'm headed - I'm headed 182, 346, 1.2, 1.1, 110, 108, 100, and 118, and off scale low on all of the bo - motors.||CC|Okay. I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, can we deploy - Okay. You want this charge deployed here?||CC|That's affirmative, Jack.||LMP-EVA|I'll deploy it now.||CC|You can deploy it right now. That's good.|04 23 25 25|LMP-EVA|Okay, the centers [?] are still on, thank goodness.||CC|Beautiful. We'll give you the Taper of the Year award.||||Tape 80A/42||||LMP-EVA|Boy, you're going to have to give me the Dunce of the Year Award after this.||CDR-EVA|Pan 1, ... two -|04 23 25 44|CDR-EVA|MARK, SAFE.||CDR-EVA|Pan 3 -|04 23 25 47|CDR-EVA|MARK, SAFE.||LMP-EVA|That will be in the pans, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|Okay, I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Bob, you got MODE ... - -||CC|... confirm that is EP-6, right?||CC|17, Houston. Do you read?||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob; we're about 15 meters from a 20-meter blocky rimmed crater. It's about 3 - 3 to 4 meters deep. All the blocks on the rim look like the pyroxene, plagioclase gabbro - the vesicular rocks seen at the LM. At least all that I've seen so far.||CC|Okay. I copied that, Jack. And is this crater to the east or west?|04 23 27 01|LMP-EVA|It's to the northwest of the Rover.||CC|Okay; copy that.||LMP-EVA|The vesicu - visicle popula - the vesicle population varies from about a 2 milli - a millimeter to 1 centimeter. It forms about 15 percent of the rock -10 to 15* And I've given you grain size and -for the rocks near the LM and that goes well for this one.||CC|Okay, I copy that, Jack. Very good.||||||Tape 80A/43||LMP-EVA|There is - the parting that I mentioned, still of somewhat unknown origin, and we'll try and get a sample along a parting plane. It's clearly evident in one of the bigger blocks.||CDR-LM|Hey, Bob, just as we stopped the Rover, I went on AUX water. Do you want me to turn my primary water off - I don't have to, do I?||CC|No, no, no need to.||CDR-EVA|That's what I figured. Just wanted to cover all bets. Okay, Jack. I think, I've got my housekeeping done.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Hey, get your hammer. We're going to need it.||CDR-EVA|I've been carrying it all day, it's about time I used it. Okay.||LMP-EVA|Bob, you're going to want a core at this site?||CC|Roger. We'd like to get - number 1 priority will be some black samples, including any dirt that was on the blocks, If there is such. And then the second priority is a rake soil sample; the third priority is a double core. Then, also in there, the pans, of course, and other documented samples. But the double core is there although it is third priority.||CDr-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Gene, do you think - Got you gnomon, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I've got my gnomon, and I've got to give a TGE. When you said, bring a hammer, I came -||LMP-EVA|I'm sorry.||CDR-EVA|No, no problem.||LMP-EVA|Well, I shouldn't have -||||Tape 80A/44||||CDR-EVA|The two go hand-in-hand. Nothing disrupts your thought patterns more than somebody saying something.||LMP-EVA|Well, listen, this is my first geology stop. I guess I'm entitled to do that; Bob, you ready for a mark?||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|04 23 29 37|LMP-EVA|MARK it. The light's flashing.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you got one picked out?||LMP-EVA|Yes, let's hit this „ see if we can work on that one, it's at the edge, but it's got - we can chip at the parting plane. And that's one of the things that's come up that I think is of interest that we've got to figure out why they have that foliation in them.||CDR-EVA|Boy, that rock is one of the more vesicular ones I've seen around.||LMP-EVA|Well, they're all about that, Gene. They're too -they're either that or mixed with that variety. In the same boulder, you'll see a - see a nonvesicular -a relatively nonvesicular. Okay, that's the - -||CDR-EVA|Watch your shadow.||LMP-EVA|- - that's the down-Sun. Okay, right into the Sun.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Right at that overlapping fracture, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Let me get where I can maybe save the rock. If you can hook your -||||||Tape 80A/45||CDR-EVA|That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to try and get it right - right up on top is where I'd like to -||LMP-EVA|If you hit it - if you hit it on the right side, it'll go this way, maybe. There you go. Good man.||CDR-EVA|Piece right there.||LMP-EVA|I can get another one, too. Try another one; don't lose that one.||CDR-EVA|Let me get that one for you.||LMP-EVA|I can get it.||CDR-EVA|Got it? Whoops. Can you keep it in sight here for a minute? Is that it?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Go ahead. Try hitting - There you go. Can you use the other end against the right side of the Rock?||CDR-EVA|I'm pressing.||LMP-EVA|Oh.||CDR-EVA|It's coming.||LMP-EVA|That's all right.||CDR-EVA|I'll get that one, wait a minute.||LMP-EVA|Be careful down in there.||CDR-EVA|The whole thing is going to fracture off here, in a minute.||LMP-EVA|That's why -||CDR-EVA|Trying.||LMP-EVA|It's trying to fall. Don't wear your hand out. That's good, Gene.||||Tape 80A/46||||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute. Let me give one more whack. The whole thing is -No, that's too tight. Let me get that other piece -|04 23 32 21|LMP-EVA|Okay. Bag 476 is the rock sample with a little bit of the soil near it - with a chip - chip off the rock, and it's the - Watch it, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Here's your other chip. If I go down there, that thing is about 15 feet deep.||LMP-EVA|Right. Got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Now, do you think you can chip off the other side of that plane, up on the edge?||CDR-EVA|Yes. Yes.||LMP-EVA|Then we'll get the soil, and maybe just a small rock, one nonchipped.||CDR-EVA|Let me tell you - n$r hands from that drill - -||LMP-EVA|Yes, I'm sure they are.||CDR-EVA|- - Really know I've been out here today.||LMP-EVA|476, Bob.||CC|Copy that, Jack.||LMP-EVA|It's from the southeast - southeast side of the parting plane -||CDR-EVA|There it is - a whole big slab, right there.||LMP-EVA|Okay, very good.||CDR-EVA|Oh, look at those dark minerals in there. Are those dark black?||LMP-EVA|Yes, they may be ilmenite or fresh pyroxene. We'll look at it. Gives the impression of pyroxene.||||||Tape 80A/47||CDR-EVA|Okay, you want my bag? I tell you, if you work on any kind of slope, like this little crater - Okay, I'm going to leave it open for a minute.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|While we get that one.||LMP-EVA|I'm going to have to - you're going to have to use your tongs on that one, I think.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I got it.||CC|And, 17, a reminder to factor into your thinking, this is only a 30-minute stop, and there's about 20 minutes remaining.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. But we got to sample something.||CDR-EVA|Here's a big one. Get him the bag number, too.|04 23 34 27|LMP-EVA|Bag 454. Okay, and the flashes are from inside of vugs and recrystallized vesicles. They looke like pyr - pyroxene flashes; they could be ilmenite.||CDR-EVA|I'll get my after picture.||LMP-EVA|Okay; let me - and let me get in there and get sane soil.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let's get it first.||LMP-EVA|From the north side. Whoops. Okay, the bag tore around that; it's pretty jagged rock, but I think it'll hold.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|... in yours. Okay? It's in Gene's sample collection bag. And a scoop sample. You got a bag handy, Gene? Okay, bag 455, Bob. It's from the west side of the rock. It's under a slight overhang of the rock - in a shadow, anyway. Okay, that's from about 1 centimeter down - deep, 1 to 2 centimeters. And the next one is down to about 5 - 5 or 6. And it's got some chips in it.||||Tape 80A/48|||04 23 35 53|CDR-EVA|That's bag 456, Bob.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay. (Laughter)||CDR-EVA|I know. I know.||LMP-EVA|Oh, shoot. 1.2 kilometers is a long way from the LM. Look at the Challenger down there. Makes you get a feel for how big this valley really is.||CDR-EVA|I'd rather not.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'll help you.||CDR-EVA|I got it.||LMP-EVA|Turn around and let me help you get these in your bag.||CDR-EVA|I learned now. You learn of necessity out here. Okay. See if we can't fill this up for Christmas. Okay, let's - You happy there?||LMP-EVA|Yes, let's - get your after -||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|And if we can, we might get just a block instead of breaking on it, and then we'll go to the rake. Let's go around to the -||CDR-EVA|Bob wanted a core here, too, huh?||LMP-EVA|Yes, but the rake's next, as you might imagine. Geno, now this - this looks - this stuff here looks a little less vesicular. Why don't we try that one?||CDR-EVA|Hey, here's - ro - look at this rock, where the vesicularity changes from a hummocky vesicularity to a very fine vesicular. Look at this. Let me try and crack - get a - See that? The change?||LMP-EVA|Yes, that's what I'm after; that's it.||||||Tape 80A/49||CDR-EVA|Let's see if I can't crack - -||LMP-EVA|That's it. That's what I saw in that other boulder.||CDR-EVA|Let's see if I can't crack the corner and get that contact.||LMP-EVA|Yes. And get a piece of both - I think you can get - if you can reach down there.||CDR-EVA|See if I can't get a -||LMP-EVA|That's a contact in a rock.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||CC|Beautiful. And you guys - do you guys see any 2-meter blouders around there?||CDR-EVA|We just sampled one. ... - -||CC|Well, if that one showed up in the photos , I wonder why those down near the ALSEP didn't show up.||LMP-EVA|No, we're not where you think we are. We're not sure where we are. Gene, can you get down into that? Need some help?||CDR-EVA|Yes, just - give me the shovel to hold myself with. Give me a shovel.||CC|I don't know.||LMP-EVA|How about that one?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Get that little piece.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I see it. It's pretty hard. See if I can't -It's low and hard to hit.||LMP-EVA|How about - how about coming around from this side?|04 23 38 59|CDR-EVA|Well, I got the gnomon in the wrong place really.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 80B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|04 23 18 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV l8|04 23 49 22|CMP|Houston, America. ...||CC|Go ahead, Ron.||CMP|Okay. Had ny headset off here, and I wasn't paying much attention when AOS came.||CC|Oh, I wasn't even talk - listening for you. I was talking to your wife.||CMP|Oh, okay.||CC|Did you get a decent meal?||CMP|Well, it wasn't too bad.||CC|Jan said - -||CMP|Turkey and gravy.||CC|Jan said she's - you're the last person she would ever think would miss a meal up there.||CMP|(Laughter) That's probably true, really.|04 23 59 08|CMP|Thank heavens.|05 00 00 05|CC|Ron, are you out - glued to a window, or are you just eating now?||CMP|I'm really just eating.||CC|Roger. Just thought I'd update here before you get into your presleep checklist ... Have a little bit of news from the day, but today's - -||CMP|Oh, okay.||||Tape 80B/2||||CC|- - sure not much news today. It's a good thing you guys made the landing today, because there wouldn't be any news in the paper tomorrow if it wasn't for you all.||CMP|(Laughter)||CC|Let's see. Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka's Liberal Democrats lost 26 seats, but he still has a firm hold on the Diet, and Tanaka still has a firm majority. And Henry Kissinger and Le Due Tho's secret Paris peace talks have bogged down some more, and they think they are bogged down under some academic situations. And - news out of Kansas City isn't too good, but President Truman is - feeling some irregular heartbeats and has reduced the optimism for his recovery.||CMP|Not too good.||CC|This last one has got to be the height of trivia. I'm just going to read it to you exactly the way it is. It's from Saigon. Question? What does an Air Force enlisted man do when he meets a naked general? He salutes. An order issued by Major Paul M. Boseman at Tan Son Nhut Air Base makes the requirement clear. Salute when you recognize an officer, even though you both are nude. An Air Force spokesman said he didn't know under what circumstances officers and enlisted personnel might encounter - encounter each, other in the nude. End of - news for tonight.||CMP|(Laughter) News - a little trivia, isn't it?||CC|Yes, indeed.||CC|Everybody from the homefront sending their love. They are having a little trouble hacking out the -the comm, since we're all on a squawk box together. So they are going to try to get it set up so just the CSM loop will go into your house tomorrow night. Tonight we had all of it, and it was kind of a jumble for them.||||||Tape 80B/3||CMP|(Laughter) I imagine so, wouldn't it? They can't turn one down - or something, huh?||CC|That's right. Well, they are going to - they are going to try and get it worked on for tomorrow so that only the CSM loop will go in there. They just had to finally give up on it and go watch the - the surface work on television because over where the loop was, it was just too much.||CMP|Yes, I bet.||CC|When you get into the presleep checklist, you. can delete the stir cryos, which is in the checklist. We won't stir the cryos, and then as you get further downstream closer to LOS here - the sleep period, we'll have you turn the TANK 2 FANS to the ON position. I'll give you a reminder on that.||CMP|Okay.|05 00 05 06|CMP|Okay, Houston-, America. BAT C is about 36.8 or 9é something like that (cough).||CC|Say again.

It - they - they - -||CMP|After the ALSEP wsts all deployed?||CC|Yes. The ALSEP's deployed. They had to cut their time at Station 1 a little bit. They got to curtail the EVA slightly short of 7 hours due to the high oxygen usage during the - deploying the ALSEP. Only 15 minutes early, so it's no big deal.||CMP|Oh., I see. Well, that's not bad.||CC|No, they1 re - Gene was working pretty hard putting tkat drill in the ground, and it was some pretty difficult work.

Let me -||LMP-EVA|Get them both with your -||CDR-EVA|Let me get them both right now.||LMP-EVA|You can stick that in the ground if you -||CDR-EVA|Okay, this is a sample of the - of the more coarsely vesicular rock.||LMP-EVA|You got it in your hand?||CMP-EVA|I got them both.

We're going to.||LMP-EVA|In bag 478 is the chip from the finely - more finely vesicular rock. Both of them are coarse.

I guess you want to sort of - out in nothing's land here, huh?||LMP-EVA|I can bag it for you, Geno.||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|That's all right. I want to get this closeup here.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I've moved about - 5 meters - 5 to 8 meters northeast of the Rover. And - as soon as Gene gets here with the gnomon -||CDR-EVA|Coming, coming.|04 23 43 50|LMP-EVA|Bob, I've got a - a sample that was laying next to that boulder. I did not get an after picture of it, but it's - as I was taking my closeup pictures, it - is on my side of the boulder just 4 or 5 inches, covered with the dark mantle.||CDR-EVA|I think we - I think we probably disturbed that one. It'll probably show up in the befores.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, we want a rake.||LMP-EVA|That's in bag 479-||CC|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Gene, let's rake - let's rake right out there.||CDR-EVA|Look, let's go ahead and bag that one; and I'll get the gnomon out there.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 81A/5||CDR-EVA|Bob, as you might have seen from the camera, up towards where we think Emory is you get a pretty high concentration of boulders up there.||CC|Okay. And I think that that's where we thought we were a little bit closer to Emory than you are.||CDR-EVA|Well, we thought about going on up there; although -we're in a pretty good area here, too, from the standpoint of boulders.||CC|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Again, I think - Face the Sun.||CC|||CDR-EVA|I think for the most part, large and small, all the frag - all the fragments seem to be - seem to be filleted or even mantled by the dark material.||LMP-EVA|Let me get out of your way.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I've got to clean my camera; I can't even see. What area are you going to rake?||LMP-EVA|To the - your left of the - well, ahead of the -ahead of the gnomon and to your left, there.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I got it.||CC|Okay, Gene, we copy that. That's a good observation. And I also gathered that most of the rocks look pretty much the same.||LMP-EVA|That's what I said.||CDR-EVA|Yes, except a change in vesicularity - -||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|- - in terms of the size of vesicles, where I described one as being a more hummocky vesicular-type rock. The first time I've noticed any of the dark minerals was when we took that one big flat chip off that boulder.||||Tape 81A/6 .||||CC|Okay; copy that.||CDR-EVA|I didn't look at it that close to see what it was.||CC|Copy that, guys.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to get a pan, Jack, while you're doing that.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|Good idea, Gene.|04 23 46 4i|CDR-EVA|Man, are there some good targets for the 500 around here. We've got to get those massifs with the 500.||CC|And, 17; again, we'd like - -||LMP-EVA|And, Bob, I'm really only penetrating - I'm only penetrating about, at the most, 3 centimeters into this area with the rake. I've picked up a very good sample of bla - of boulders but most of them were - were in that distance of the surface and projecting out of it.||CC|Okay; I copy that.||LMP-EVA|You ready, Gene?||CDR-EVA|A couple of more. Jack. Okay, coming at you. Bob, the pan is complete. I'll give you a frame count shortly.||CC|Copy that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|There's two bags, I think.||LMP-EVA|Two bags full. First bag is 457 - -||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|457||CDR-EVA|Let me, let me - don't let me lose them. That's enough. Give me a couple of small ones.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||||||Tape 81A/7||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's good. That's good. Okay.||LMP-EVA|Here, ... They are.||CDR-EVA|Okay, in bag 458 is the rest of the - the rake sample. They're all fragments.||CC|Copy that. Now we need the kilogram of the soil.||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob. All the fragments, of course, are -are completely covered with - the mantle; and they are slightly - oh, maybe 20-percent vesicular. I just took a glance at them. But, for the most part, they appear to be rounded and subrounded fragments.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let's get the kilogram.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Oh, well, shoot. Start all over.||CDR-EVA|Try it again. 459 will get the kilogram, Bob.||CC|Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Get some more.||CDR-EVA|Okay, fill it up.||LMP-EVA|Can you close it?||CDR-EVA|Yes, yes, I can close it.||LMP-EVA|That's a good kilogram.||CDR-EVA|Well, I just can't even read my camera anymore. I've got to learn how to control the dust. Okay, that's in.||LMP-EVA|Okay; you get the answer?||CDR-EVA|I tried to blow the dust off my camera - -||||Tape 81A/8||||LMP-EVA|If we could get a - I think it's going to be hard to get a double core here. We could try a single right there. Bob, we got time to get the core?||CC|Negative. The core has been deleted. We'd like for you to get your second pan, Jack, and then we'll press on.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|I'll get it over here where our two sample sites are in view.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Well, now I know why I felt that we were much too close to Trident than what I thought. We weren't really too close to Trident because Trident is way out here. That makes me feel better. A guy would know if he landed 100 meters from a big set of craters like that. You know, on a landing site like this, you ought to know exactly where you are. Anyway, I landed where I wanted to. Okay, Bob, here's a reading for you.|04 23 51 34|CC|Okay. Ready for it.||CDR-EVA|670, 012, 901; 670, 012, 901.||CC|Okay; copy that, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay, and we - no more charges to deploy back -going back, right?||CC|No, we will deploy charge number 7 on the way back.||CDR-EVA|On the way back. Okay.||CC|Roger. It will be deployed at the same location we were originally planning on deploying it, which was in the checklist there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Very good, sir. We'll get at it.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I'm taking your camera.||||||Tape 81A/9||CC|Okay. And, Jack, you got the pan or getting it?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir.||CDR-EVA|And, Bob, CDR is on frame count 60.||CC|Okay ´||LMP-EVA|Which one? And the LMP is on 95-||CC|Copy, 95.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Gene.||CDR-EVA|We need EP-7é Jack.||LMP-EVA|You got the gnomon?||CDR-EVA|Got the gnomon.||LMP-EVA|And the rake and the scoop?||CDR-EVA|The rake and the scoop are back on. Okay, get the charge. I'll set the low gain, and we'll be -ready to do it.||LMP-EVA|Bob, my impression right now is that the dark mantle may just be a - a - well, at least in here, it's indistinguishable from a regolith that might be derived from these other rocks. It seems to be a little dark for that, but that might be the answer.||CC|Okay. We'll - -||LMP-EVA|EP-7?||CDR-EVA|EP-7.||CC|We're ... to do on that again tomorrow. And EP-7 is the charge, right?||CDR-EVA|Jack, I figured out if you - if you mount the Rover at 90 degrees, when you kick up your feet, you - you'll miss the dust.||||Tape 81A/10||||LMP-EVA|Let me hook you in before I do that.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Just put your seat 90 degrees to it.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Well, you certainly ride high.||CDR-EVA|Do I?||LMP-EVA|Yes. I'm surprised the belt fits.||CDR-EVA|Yes, it fits fine. Okay. I'm in.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Oop -||LMP-EVA|Not too good, huh?||CDR-EVA|Yes. We're learning. I hope my bag was closed. Yours was. Did you get it?||LMP-EVA|Yes - yes. I - as a matter of fact, I did. I thought that.|04 23 55 07|CC|Okay, we mark you underway.||LMP-EVA|Hey, you ought to put that sampler d - -||CDR-EVA|Not yet.||LMP-EVA|It's not the sampler - it's these bags with Emony [?].||CDR-EVA|This thing is too high for you. You're hitting it all the time. No, we're not on our way, Bob.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. And you want the - charge deployed at 320.7, huh?||CC|Roger. It will be 0.6. We'll change that to 0.6 on EP-7 but - and it will really be just wherever you cross 0.6 on the range.||||||Tape 81A/11||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Well, it fit once.||CDR-EVA|Did you twist it, Jack? 180, that took out some of your - Wait a minute - here.||LMP-EVA|Which way?||CDR-EVA|Well, I can't see. Your left hand's in the way now. Away from you. Twist it away from you 180 degrees.||LMP-EVA|Like that?||CDR-EVA|Yes, now the other 90. Okay, now try it.||LMP-EVA|Well, let me see.||CDR-EVA|You got it?||LMP-EVA|That should - that should do it. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay?||CDR-EVA|Here's your charge. I think you're learning. That's half of the first EVA. Okay, Bob, we are rolling.|04 23 56 47|CDR-EVA|MARK it.||CC|Okay, copy that, Jack - Gene.||LMP-EVA|Okay, what was it - where did they want it deployed?||CDR-EVA|Six-tenths of a kilometer.||LMP-EVA|Back, huh?||CC|Roger. It'll be at a range of 0.6, guys.||LMP-EVA|You've got a block right ahead of you.||CDR-EVA|I got it.||||Tape 81A/12||||CC|Okay. And remember you'll be taking photos coming back here, Jack - -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. Thank you. I got a few going out, Bob, but they weren't too well spaced.||CC|Okay. And I assume you've got the low gain antenna aligned.||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir; it's aligned. Okay.||CDR-EVA|That's got to be Trident, Jack, because that's too big for anything else.|04 23 58 52|LMP-EVA|Okay* Houston. There's - the classic raindrop pattern over this fine debris. I'd say that the surface definitely is sorted, the fine regolithic material forming one fraction and then the blocks another. The blocks are prob - those blocks are greater than a - 2 centimeters in diameter. In general, make up less than 10 percent of the surface. But there are some big ones. And it - fairly uniformly distributed. There are blocks a meter in diameter.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack, that big crater out there at 2 o'clock has probably got to be Sherlock. That's got to be Sherlock over there.||LMP-EVA|Yes, probably. I think the only place I've really identified that we can go to is to station 6.||CDR-LMP|Yes, but you can't - we've got to get on a high vantage point here one of these days.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Wall, I think we'll find Camelot without any problem.|-|CDR-EVA|Yes. Okay, watch. I'm going through it.||||||Tape 81A/13||LMP-EVA|Okay. No problem.||CDR-EVA|No, I'd rather straddle or go through those little ones.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Bob, here's another crater about the same size we sampled - the last station. And it doesn't have as many blocks, but it does have blocks. And from this distance, their vesicular texture and their light color shows up very well. I suspect they're the same general kind. There's a glass-bottom crater.||CC|Okay. You got a range and - -||SC-EVA|...||CC|- - bearing, there, guys, please.||CDR-EVA|Okay, 341.8.||CC|Copy that.||CDR-EVA|Did you take a picture, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|You're pointed right at station 6,1 think, Gene.||CDR-EVA|I think you may be right. There's that boulder. I just want to get up here where I can ... - -||LMP-EVA|Not the one on the track but the one over there to the right of that.||LMP-EVA|Unless the one with the track -I'm - I've got mixed emotions which is 6.||CDR-EVA|That's - that's probably - look over there to the left. You see that.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|That's Trident. Man, I'll tell you.||||Tape 81A/14||||LMP-EVA|Look at this thing. That looks like the same kind of rock except it doesn't have any vesicles.||CDR-EVA|There's some white stuff in that rock. Just let me take a quick pic ...||CDR-EVA|See that one right in front of it? Take a picture of it.||LMP-EVA|Oh, you mean this one, here.||CDR-EVA|Oh, that's a - that's a big zap pit, isn't it? Take a picture of that?||LMP-EVA|Yes, they're big zap pits. Same rock with big zap pits. I got to change the - well, ... Okay. Although there are - I think those are zap pits. It's a little hard to say.||CDR-EVA|Looks like a big chip out of the rock.||LMP-EVA|They're white halos; it just has more of them.||CDR-EVA|But it's a big one; it's about an inch and a half or 2 inches across.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I tell you, I've got to go and get my skies and geometry squared away.||CC|Okay, 17, how about - -||CDR-EVA|Did you see this one?||CC|#NAME?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay. 341.7- Bob, we're moving at about 11 clicks rigjit now.||CC|Copy that. Beautiful. Remember the charge goes off at 0.6.|-|LMP-EVA|Doesn't sound like - Okay.||||||Tape 81A/15||LMP-EVA|Okay, we want to - -||CDR-EVA|Over there's the mantle - there's the white mantle Jack, look over there. Can you look to your left?||LMP-EVA|Yes, it does. Yes.||CDR-EVA|That's the white mantle.||LMP-EVA|Swing around that way.||CDR-EVA|Call it a slide or not, but that's the white mantle. Whoo! That's my first real good picture of it. That is something.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I got some of that. Okay, how are we doing?||CDR-EVA|I don't want to go in that crater, that's what I don't want to do. Okay. We're at 0.6; how about 339 ...||LMP-EVA|Okay. I got a couple of shots right in there.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Coming right around to you.||LMP-EVA|Oh, that's good. Hold that heading. Whoa. That'll be good.||CDR-EVA|Right here?||LMP-EVA|Yes, whoa.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Let me get my - Okay, I got my locator.||LMP-EVA|Okay, now this one we want me to get a partial pan until something's identified.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We'll do that. We've got to turn that way anyway.|05 00 02 32|LMP-EVA|Okay, pin 1, pull, SAFE. Pin 2, pull, SAFE. Pin 3 -|05 00 02 4l|LMP-EVA|MARK it, pull, SAFE.||CC|Okay. And I copy that as charge number 7-||LMP-EVA|That's affirm.||||Tape 81A/16||||CC|Okay. And we'd like a frame number when you get done there, Jack, after you get it on the ground.||LMP-EVA|Okay, stand by. Okay. I think we'll miss that.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Bearing is 339.6.||LMP-EVA|Okay, start a - a pan around it, Gene - -||CC|Copy that, Gene - -||LMP-EVA|Okay, let me get it out - Okay, camera starts slowly ... Okay.||CDR-EVA|Going to miss it?||LMP-EVA|Yes, by a lot.||CDR-EVA|Okay, taking your pictures?||LMP-EVA|Yes, sir. Wheels cleared it by - it's got to be a lot. Is my low gain dropping out?||CDR-EVA|How much are my wheels missing it by - going around?||LMP-EVA|Lots. About a meter. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay. We're on our way. The low gain is set again.||CDR-EVA|Okay, we're heading on back to SEP.||CC|Okey, and a frame count there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Okay, pan - was more - the pan was more or less complete at l46.||CC|Copy, 146 on auto[mobile].||LMP-EVA|Bob, you know, the more I look at this - Watch out for those babies there - at this - at this dark dust, if you will, the more it doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd expect to have been „ derived from the underlying bedrock. But I think you're going to have to play that game in the lab right now.||||||Tape 81A/17||CC|Okay, I copy that. Can you - -||LMP-EVA|We'll see how it works out later.||CC|Roger.||LMP-EVA|It just seems dark and much too fine grain. It -don't have the impression that you're getting the size distribution you'd expect to get by having all these blocks around.||CC|Okay, I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Definitely, I think, at least in my mind, ... population - size population - -||CDR-EVA|Jack, that almost looks like bedrock over exposed in there. See that?||LMP-EVA|Yes, why don't you take a pass over that way. Get through there?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I can get through there.||LMP-EVA|Do you know where you are?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|In Trident?||CDR-EVA|Yes, no - no, we're not in Trident. That's awful - that's pretty steep down in there. I'd walk down there. I'm not sure I want to drive down there yet.||LMP-EVA|No, I didn't mean down in there. I meant right over there.||CDR-EVA|Well, here's some right here.||LMP-EVA|Yes. ...||CDR-EVA|Take a picture of that?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||||Tape 8lA/l8|CC|And how about a range and bearing when you stop, to take the picture.||CDR-EVA|Okay - -||CC|We need a - -||CDR-EVA|336.4.||CC|336.4. Roger.|05 00 05 59|CDR-EVA|Bob, I get a distinct impression that - Jack says it's going to be hard to tell whether this is regolith composed from the rock field we see around, but - I get a distinct impression - you can see that dark mantle over on top of almost all the rocks. Except we have fresh glass, possibly, in the bottom of some of these small craters.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Everywhere else there is actually mantle, I believe, in and around some of the crevices and in the vesicles and what have you.||CC|Okay, I copy--||CDR-EVA|It's all material though, that could be - it's material that could be knocked in there by the local impact.||CC|Okay; but I gather you find a lot of material on top of the rocks.||LMP-EVA|I think we lost them.||CDR-EVA|Not a lot, Bob. Not a lot. It's there, though.||CC|Okay; copy that.||CDR-EVA|They're not nearly as covered with dust as they -as they get when - when you drop one. It's just a - it's really a salting or a scattering of debris in the depressions - -||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 81A/19||CDR-EVA|#NAME?||CC|Okay. I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Yes, but most of all - most of all the craters are - have relatively ..., except where the rocks are showing the boulders on the side, or - within the craters are evident - are suddenly covered over with this mantle. You don't see any good sharp ridges on - walls on some of these craters. Even the small ones.||CC|Okay. Roger on that.||CDR-EVA|Man, I tell you, you could lose the rear end of this thing in a hurry, if you'd like.||LMP-EVA|I think you have lost a fender. I keep getting rained on here.||CDR-EVA|Oh, no.||LMP-EVA|Look at that rooster tail - look what's ahead of us here.||CDR-EVA|Yes, that's probably it. It probably didn't stay. I can see it in a shadow.||LMP-EVA|Sure, look at it.||CDR-EVA|Oh boy, that's going to be terrible. That is really going to be bad.||LMP-EVA|I didn't see it. We probably lost it. I think I know when because I just started to notice it. Bob, I'm going to state what Gene said slightly differently. There just aren't a lot of very sharp, bright craters, but there are some. All the craters seem to be pretty well formed. It isn't an extensive mantle. Matter of fact, for example, hasn't filled the ... Are we due to deploy that thing now?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I - want to - want to - come in at a -||LMP-EVA|Hasn't filled the bottom of the craters.||||Tape 81A/20||||CDR-EVA|I'm going to come in at a heading here and see if I can get on it for you.||LMP-EVA|Okay, drop me off there.||CDR-EVA|Look at that fender. Look at the dust it's produced. Look at the LCRU.||LMP-EVA|Yes, it's going to make - -||CDR-EVA|I don't know how to keep that thing on.||LMP-EVA|Make it west.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm rolling west right now.||LMP-EVA|That looks good. That looks good. Hold that heading.||CDR-EVA|Boy, I don't like losing that fender.||LMP-EVA|We're back at the SEP, Bob. I'm starting to lay out my first track.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|How's our time, Bob?||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CC|Roger. You're about 5 minutes behind on the -the arrival time at the SEP. But we're - we're -No real problem. And I assume that the range and bearing, when you got there, was about zero.|05 00 11 02|LMP-EVA|Okay, get - Let me leave my camera.||CDR-EVA|Well, let me read it. 252, 2.5, and 0. I'm resetting.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|And the LMP frame count is 19 - 197? and it was s till turning. ^||CDR-EVA|Amp-hours are 108 105 5 and batteries are 100 and 120.||||||Tape 81A/21||CC|Okay. Copy 100 and 120.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Oh, wait a minute. I need my camera, don't I?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir.||CC|I don't think it's much good to you with a 197 there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|No, I don't. I don't need my camera.||CC|Roger on that.||LMP-EVA|We're deploying it. No, you take the pictures. I don't need it. Go ahead, play it out.||CDR-EVA|Okay; you're right. Okay, here we go. I'm headed out.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Houston. The location is in about the least cratered area I could find, between a large crater or a large depression that's about - oh, ranges from maybe 50 to 150 meters behind the LM. That's maybe - south - or east-southeast; and it's between that depression and another large depression that is really a doublet with a blocky septum between them. That's to the northeast of the LM about 200 meters; that's the start of that second depression. I think we can get a nice layout, although there'll be a general slope, I believe, towards the LM - of about 1 degree.||CC|Okay, that's no real problem, Jack. No problem, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Jack, am I about abeam of you? I can't see.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll turn in around this crater.||LMP-EVA|Hey, if you come right -||LMP-EVA|That depression to the northeast is at least a couple hundred meters in diameter, and it's joined with one that's probably of comparable size just to the northwest of the first depression.||||Tape 81A/22||||CC|Okay, I copy that too, Jack.||CDR-EVA|Okay. How's that look, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Great.||CDR-EVA|Far enough?||LMP-EVA|Yes. Yes, come back.||CDR-EVA|... we head on up to station 2 without that fender and are we going to be full of dust.||LMP-EVA|Okay, there's no special -||CDR-EVA|I can park 180 but -|05 00 14 03|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I've stopped - back at the SEP.||CC|Copy that, Gene.||CDR-EVA|Dropped the - One came out, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Oh, yes. This thing is a lot harder to turn than it was in training.||CDR-EVA|Oops. Okay, that's the first two we've got to deploy. Can you bring your tongs?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Bob, do you want me to dust this? I'll dust b ack at the LM. We're going to deploy the SEP. God bless.||CC|Okay. They all say to dust, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay. You're going to have to wait for me, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Well, I've got antennas all over the place here.||CDR-EVA|Yes, as a matter of fact, you do. Stand by 1 second. I'll make it a quick one.||LMP-EVA|That's all right. No, I can handle it, I think, here. But we're going to need your tongs to pick them up and not get them all confused. Okay, where's the shadow graph? There it is. Sun quadrant - that's the Sun quadrant.||||||Tape 81A/23||CDR-EVA|For sure we lost that fender.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'll deploy number 2 and 4. And, let's see, that's number 1. This one must be number 2. It is.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm almost there, Jack. Let me run around and dust. Let me tell you, this dust isn't going to be fun tomorrow.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I won't bore you with details on why you see the antenna all over the ground (laughter) but it has to do with 1/6 g.||CC|Roger, Jack. Understand you dropped a couple of the antenna reels.||LMP-EVA|You know, Bob, they're very - more accurately, I dropped three of them. Bob, you know this finegrained dust that we're in could be groundup pyroclastic. It might grind more easily than other things, and the blocks are just the - those blocks that have been excavated from below that pyroclastic by the larger craters and some of the smaller ones in the area.|05 00 17 46|CDR-EVA|MARK, gravimeter reading.||CC|Okay; mark that. Roger, Jack. That would make a nice story, wouldn't it?||LMP-EVA|... Well, you'd think glassy pyroclastic might turn into regolith a little bit faster than some of these other things. But we'll check that one out.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|You want 2?||LMP-EVA|Two, and you get 1. Right there.||CC|And, Jack, did you get the reels straightened out again?||LMP-EVA|Yes, they're okay.||||Tape 81A/24||||CC|Thank you.||LMP-EVA|How can you stop a crew like this?||CC|I don't know any way.||LMP-EVA|In all modesty, I mean. Okay, Geno, I'm on my way. Pull gently on that thing because I - it's awful easy to knock it over. I had that geophone module all over the place.||CDR-EVA|I can't tell whether I'm pulling gently or not.||LMP-EVA|Any time you feel a tug, stop.||CC|Careful, guys.||CDR-EVA|At least we're pulling at the base. I better watch what I'm backing into. There's a lot of holes around here.||LMP-EVA|Well, it happened, Bob. I'm glad we Velcroed those - tabs.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm at the end, Jack. Are you having -||LMP-EVA|Well, I - What happened was which we thought might happen. It twisted on my - I'll be there in just a second.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I want f/ll at 250 and 74 feet. Well - ah, ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, yes; you're pulling it over.||LMP-EVA|I'm not. You are.||CDR-EVA|No, I'm not. I've got all sorts of slack in here.||LMP-EVA|Okay, it's okay.||CDR-EVA|All right. Are you out there?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me back up - a skosh and take the slack out. And I would say, offhand -Oh, boy, what have you got a - that's about as close to a 1/6-g orthogonal - at least, not orthogonal yet, but straight lined. That's it Jack, here.||||||Tape 81A/25||LMP-EVA|Stay there, and I'll take a picture.||CDR-EVA|I thought you did.||LMP-EVA|No. Okay, I got it now.||CMP-EVA|Hey, if you try and stick that thing in, Jack, you're going to fall over. Just set it down, and we'll stay away from it.||LMP-EVA|Yes. You talked me into it.||CDR-EVA|That was a good idea, but - that's a good straight line.||LMP-EVA|(Singing) We were strolling in the park one day -Well, we've had lots of good ideas in our time.||CDR-EVA|Oh, boy; the thing that makes me sick is losing that fender. I can stand a lot of things, but I sure don't like that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I get number 4, which - Where is it? Is that the one on the ground?||CDR-EVA|It's probably the one on the ground. Got it? Is that the right one?|05 00 22 16|LMP-EVA|Well, 3 - No, this is yours.||CDR-EVA|No. Take it; doesn't make any difference.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm deploying the - the LMP's deploying reel 3 for your photography purposes.||CC|Roger. Copy that.||LMP-EVA|Oh, - Hey, push that in.||CDR-EVA|Roger.||LMP-EVA|Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha.||CDR-EVA|Serves you right.||LMP-EVA|This doesn't push.||||Tape 81A/26||||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm ready to stroll.||LMP-EVA|(Humming) I found a brown rock that I'm going to bring back.||CDR-EVA|Please do.||LMP-EVA|I think it's the back side of a piece of glass, but it's brown.||CDR-EVA|Well, I think I'm more or less on your track. It wiggled a little bit.||LMP-EVA|Well, we're - Oh, oh, oh, ooh, stop, Geno.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, wait a minute. That looks orthagonal to me. Got your picture?||LMP-EVA|Will have in a sec. Wait a minute. Every time I do something, I change the setting. Okay, I got it. I straightened the line out a little bit better after I took the picture - a few kinks in it. Now where's my brown rock? I saw it when I was driving with the Rover. I knew I'd be able to come back here because of the tracks. Looks like an old piece of bread.||CC|Is that the one that came out of the hatch?||CDR-EVA|„ the heck is that? Huh? Oh, it's a piece of -Well, it's a piece of glass, all right - crumbled -part of it crumbled but - I got to get that in a bag. Oh, man, is that a nice piece of glass. Just laying out there all by itself. Jack, well -you got a bag handy while I take wy pan. I can't reach a bag; I got this sample in the wrong hand.||LMP-EVA|I don't have a bag.||CDR-EVA|You don't have - well, take one off of mine and give it to me. I'll take it back to the Rover. Wa, wa, wa! Watch it; you've got a wire under your foot.||LMP-EVA|Bag number 460.||||||Tape 81A/27||CC|Copy that. 460 has brown glass.||CDR-EVA|I'm halfway out on the north course - -||CC|Sorry about that.||CDR-EVA|- - I'm halfway out on the north course of the -of the SEP.||LMP-EVA|It's brown vesicular glass. Sort of a yellow-brown, as a matter of fact.|05 00 26 01|CDR-EVA|Okay, it says - take locator photo to LM. I thought I took a pan here. The LM wasn't - Okay.||CC|Yes, the locator is really all you need; but a partial pan to show the area would be appreciated.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'm here. I'm going to get a partial pan, Bob.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|The only reason I'm doing it is I know it would be appreciated.||CDR-EVA|Okay, take locator to photo LM; I got it. Bob, I'm on - if I can get where I can read it - on about 71 on my frame count; and let me give you -Boy, we got to stay out of this area, Jack. We'll pick up these cables just as sure as the devil. Oh, that fender. Boo - boo.||LMP-EVA|Hey, Houston, will you look at your solar panel?||CC|Roger. We see the solar panel.||LMP-EVA|You notice how they flop up?||CC|We noticed that, too.||LMP-EVA|I think we need some gray tape.||CDR-EVA|Okay, 670, 010, 101; that's 670, 010, 101.||CC|Okay, I got that one, Geno.||||Tape 81A/28||||CDR-EVA|The wires have memory. Okay, let me - -||LMP-EVA|I need gray tape.||CDR-EVA|Let me put this in your bag, and I'll get the gray tape.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|..., Jack, we didn't break any records collecting samples, but at least we got an ALSEP deployed. That gray tape, Jack, is not going to stick on anything with dust.||LMP-EVA|I know; that's what I was thinking.||CDR-EVA|Because I just been there with that fender.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's try it. You have a -||CDR-EVA|I don't need the scissors. I can cut it without it. Come on. Once we - Don't back up in that wire - Just like the cover of a -||LMP-EVA|Got it?||CDR-EVA|... that?||LMP-EVA|Yes, I guess. Okay.||CDR-EVA|Get this side?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Keep from falling over. You want to take those polar - solar panels off?||LMP-EVA|Let me hold on to you.||CDR-EVA|Okay, lean on me.||CDR-EVA|If not, let's take them off and hold them.||LMP-EVA|No, I think it's going to be easier this way.||||||Tape 81A/29||CDR-EVA|Okay, try it. I don't think they're going to be much problem the way they are, anyway.||LMP-EVA|You holding?||CDR-EVA|Yes, go ahead and lean if you want.||LMP-EVA|I don't know how long it will stay.||CDR-EVA|No, I don't know. Okay, there's one.||LMP-EVA|Give me another one.|05 00 29 49|CC|It's only going to stay for 2 days, guys.||CDR-EVA|... pull the whole thing over.||LMP-EVA|This will be a - this will be a test. If it holds -holds until we see it again -||CDR-EVA|... Don't knock the whole thing over.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm leaning on you.||CDR-EVA|Okay, lean.||LMP-EVA|The piece of tape is so dusty - it may not work.||CDR-EVA|Try it somewhere. Okay, are you happy with the alignment?||LMP-EVA|I was. Is the gnomon the zero mark?||CDR-EVA|Gnomon is right up to zero mark.||LMP-EVA|That's where it's supposed to be.||CC|||CDR-EVA|Okay, and the level bubble is just touching the -the inner circle.||CC|Okay, copy that. And we have that transmitter switch in STANDBY, right?||CDR-EVA|Bob, there's just a couple little bows around the transmitter, is that -||||Tape 81A/30||||LMP-EVA|It will be -||CDR-EVA|Oh, those are all right - those are okay.||LMP-EVA|Let's forget those.||CDR-EVA|Jack, looking where the LM is, if I were you, I'd just walk down.||LMP-EVA|Come here, Gene.||CDR-EVA|What do you need?||LMP-EVA|I need same support.||CDR-EVA|Yes; boy, that's the key around here.||LMP-EVA|Everything on this SEP is coming off harder than it did in the - when we deployed it at the Cape. See that? It just ... It may not be harder, but it ...||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Now, I got to reorient it.||CDR-EVA|Now, let me see. You're STANDBY - now let me look at it - The gnomon's right at zero.||LMP-EVA|Okay, right at zero.||CDR-EVA|It's just the same - it settled back just the same. Zero gnomon and inner circle.||CC|Okay; beautiful.||LMP-EVA|Let's go.||CMP-EVA|You want to walk back or ride?||LMP-EVA|Let's see -||CDR-EVA|It's up to you but -||LMP-EVA|Oh, I'll walk back.||CDR-EVA|Man, I hate this dust. I got to make a new fender tonight.||||||Tape 81A/31||LMP-EVA|Well, let's see, I guess I'm supposed to -||CC|Hey, Gene, I presume that the fender that came off is the fender that came off before, right?||CDR-EVA|Yes, same one. My tape didn't hold; it was too dusty.||CC|All right.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Hey, watch out for this antenna line I found out here.||CDR-EVA|Yes. Okay, travel to LM, Okay, Bob, I'm not going to change anything right now except get in and travel. All right?||CC|That's affirm. Time to go home.||LMP-EVA|How's our time, Bob?||CC|You'll have a nominal closeout, guys, as soon as you get back. We're right about on the time that we've been figuring on for you guys to get back there on. Right now, you are 6 hours and 11 minutes into the EVA.||CDR-EVA|Boy, here's a big boulder.||LMP-EVA|Gene, I discovered something - I learned a lot today, let me tell you.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you're going to lose TV because the high gain is going to be out of whack here in a minute.|05 00 33 39|LMP-EVA|Hey, I got a football-size rock of this vesicular -coarsely vesicular gabbro, Bob. It's off a large 3- to 4-meter buried boulder to the north -oh, let's say, northeast of the LM about 30 meters.||LMP-EVA|Do you read, Bob?||CC|Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear on that one.||LMP-EVA|Okay. It'll be in the big bag.||||Tape 81A/32||||CC|Okay, ...||LMP-EVA|Undocumented, it's about - it's roughly tabular -15 by 25 centimeters and about 5 to 7 centimeters thick. One - one face is very flat; looks like it was off of a parting plane, which were in that rock.||CC|Okay, and if it fits in the SRC with all the other samples, you might put it there because the SRC's going to be kind of empty.||CDR-EVA|Got any new parking angles for your batteries or anything?||CC|No, it will be a heading of 013, which is hardly a change at all from the 012 in the checklist.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'll buy that.||CC|Jack, did you copy my comments about putting that thing in the SRC perhaps?||LMP-EVA|Well, it was pretty big. It's in the big bag now. We can do that.||CC|Well, I'd get*the other samples - the small ones and particularly soils in the SRC first.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Are you through?||LMP-EVA|No, I'm going right - right about here. Now I'm done.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Right there.|05 00 36 15|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, 086, 0.5, 0.1, 108 - Oh - oh, 102.||LMP-EVA|Stand by 1.||CDR-EVA|Amp-hours are at 108, 102; volts are 74 and 75-Batteries are 108 and 123. Motors are all off scale low, all four of them.||||||Tape 81A/33||CC|Roger, Gene. Understand 108, 102 on the amp-hours, hub?||CDR-EVA|That's affirm; 108 and 102.||CC|Okay; copy that.||CDR-EVA|I can't read this thing, because it's full of dust, so I've got to get off and dust it.||LMP-EVA|Okay, the SEP receiver temp is 45, 45-||CC|Copy 45* Beautiful.||LMP-EVA|You know, I think they left some Velcro off of this thing, Gene. There's no Velcro holding those flaps down.||CDR-EVA|Isn't there?||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I've got to get the brush and dust that thing - a minute or 2.||LMP-EVA|Okay, ... get the high gain.||CDR-EVA|I feel like taking some core tubes tomorrow.||CC|I have a feeling you've got a couple left over, don't you?||CDR-EVA|Bob, you got -||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Bob, you got the high gain?||CC|Okay, thank you.||CDR-EVA|Is that - is that my bag, Jack, you got?||LMP-EVA|Yes .||CDR-EVA|That's pretty good.||||Tape 81A/34||||CC|Okay, let's put all the stuff in that bag, Jack -both the stuff that's in yours and the stuff that's in Gene's.||LMP-EVA|Okay. ... Samples - two samples from under the LMP's seat.||CDR-EVA|Put these under the seat. Clean you up here while I'm at it. Oh, man, I tell you, it's going to take us half - a dozen Sundays to dust. Look at that fender; that's terrible.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you want to get my bag off?||CDR-EVA|Yes. If you're ready.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|I've got to put your - those samples in the SRC, in your bag; and we'll save this one, I guess.||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute. Let me clean you up.||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Did you get me cleaned up?||LMP-EVA|Yes, you've lost your - -||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute.||LMP-EVA|- - your strap though, here.||CDR-EVA|Wait a minute, now, ... Okay, you get my hook back up over here.||LMP-EVA|Okay, - my - turn around. Your hook's up, but I'm not sure I closed your - your other one. Take a look at it. Yes, it's all closed. Okay, you're good. There you go.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you're filling which bag, the -||LMP-EVA|Putting them in the bag that goes into the SRC -||CDR-EVA|That's SRC - SCB 1.||||||Tape 81A/35||CC|Roger.||CDR-EVA|Okay; let's see, offload LM - PLSS - core cap dispenser tools. Okay, as soon as you get that, I'll take that SCB 1 from you, and I'll close the SRC 1.||CC|Okay; and I gather you didn't have any Rover samples today, did you, Jack?||CDR-EVA|I've still got my tongs here. I got - -||LMP-EVA|No, I have one sample bag in my pocket that has a rock in it.||CC|We'll have to take that out when we get in the Rover, I assume.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Gene, where's that - you want to put that little rock?||CDR-EVA|Yes, is it there?||LMP-EVA|Well, what did you do with it?||CDR-EVA|It was on the floor on my side.||LMP-EVA|Your side?||CDR-EVA|There it is; let me get it.||LMP-EVA|We can put that in one of the core tube slots here.|05 00 43 02|CDR-EVA|Boy, that one fender just - just is an order of magnitude more of a dust problem. Here can you reach it?||LMP-EVA|Okay, the rock that Gene picked up - early - right at the start, is in a core tube slot in the SRC 1.||CC|Okay, I copy that.||LMP-EVA|Okay, Gene, you want this one?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I want the full one.||LMP-EVA|Yes. Latched.||||Tape 81A/36||||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Bob, that's almost full of samples, and I think that big rock would be - probably wouldn't fit in there.||CC|Okay, then we'll put that in the big bag.||LMP-EVA|It's in the big bag.||CC|Good enough. And I gather there's no Rover samples today, right?||CDR-EVA|Okay - No Rover samples; sorry.||CDR-EVA|Okay, the seal is clear, like I promised I'd make it, coming over the top. Bob, the seal is clear.||CC|Beautiful.||CDR-EVA|I don't know if it's beautiful, but it's clear.||CC|It's clearly beautiful.||CDR-EVA|Okay, okay, that big mamou is locked. I got a lot of oxygen. I still got 22 percent.||LMP-EVA|I expect our feedwater may be getting a little low.||CDR-EVA|I'm going to leave this right here until I take it up to you. Okay, close ... verify good seal, place in plus-Z. Okay, LRV circuit breakers: LRV LCRU power OFF. Dust - well, let me get at that dusting first.||LMP-EVA|Give me a yell when you need a spell there.||CDR-EVA|What, dusting?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Well, I need a fender, that's what I need. Figure out something we can make a fender with.||LMP-EVA|How about one of the others that's not as critical?||||||Tape 81A/37||CDR-EVA|Yes, but I wouldn't ever take one of those off. You know, getting it - I had one to put on and it didn't stay, which is what I figured.||LMP-EVA|I thought you said it was broken, though?||CDR-EVA|Well, it was. But these aren't supposed to come off, either, unless you break them. I broke that one. My hammer got caught underneath it. It wasn't the fender's fault.||LMP-EVA|Okay, the core tube is packed.||LMP-EVA|Every time I read containment bag, it fools me; I can't figure out what it is.||CDR-EVA|Every time what?||LMP-EVA|I read containment bag.||CDR-EVA|(Laughter) You've been thinking of the other kind too long. You've been living in the command module too long.||CDR-EVA|That's a pretty good day's workout, you know. You know, I don't think we need an exercise period. We get back in there. I don't think we have to apologize to anybody. I'm sorry we didn't get out to station 1. One of the main reasons is, I think, we could have got our navigation bearings a little bit better.||LMP-EVA|Well, I'll tell you. That new ALSEP had more to it than met the eye.||CDR-EVA|This hole out here - you know, this is just such an easy site to find out and to identify yourself on and to land in. But, I tell you, all of a sudden there is so many local holes that I can't think big enough.||LMP-EVA|Does that sound familiar?||CDR-EVA|Okay, Jack, ... rest of my dusting until - -||LMP-EVA|Am I in your way?||||Tape 81A/38||||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'd like to get over there to get the - this last battery cover. I can. That's good enough. I can get over there now. I want to make sure these things stay clean because I don't want to walk.||LMP-EVA|I agree. Okay, Bob, containment bags and two cameras are stowed in the ETB.||CC|Copy that. And don't forget the scissors, guys.||LMP-EVA|Don't worry. I've got them right here.||CC|Beautiful - don't want to go hungry.||LMP-EVA|It's a good call, Bob. That's right.||CC|And, Jack, give me your consideration - or Gene -on that question of bringing back the big bag into the cabin. The people down here are saying they want to bring it in, and then we'd end up bringing it back out in the second EVA. What do you guys think about that?|05 00 47 23|LMP-EVA|That's all right; we can do that.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we can do that - I guess just because that rock's in there, huh?||LMP-EVA|I'd like to do that - look at that rock with the handle in it.||CC|All right; so then we'd be taking it back out in the second EVA, if you guys are agreeable to that.||LMP-EVA|Yes, we'll do that, Bob.||CC|And, Jack, do you think it'll go in the SCB?||LMP-EVA|Say again.||CC|Do you think it'll go in the SCB number 2?||LMP-EVA|What would - the bock - the rock?||CC|Yes, that's right.||||||Tape 81A/39||LMP-EVA|Well, it'll go in there. It's not that big.||CC|Okay, why don't you put it in SCB - why don't you put it in SCB 2 and bring that in, instead. Leave SRB out, and then we'll just leave SCB 2 in forever.||LMP-EVA|Okay.|05 00 48 18|CDR-EVA|Okay, verify SRC plus-Z pad. What are those things going over? What is that, Jack? Hey, something just hit here! What blew? Hey, what is that?||LMP-EVA|Oh, your antenna - your - it's that styrofoam off the high-gain antenna package.||CDR-EVA|On the LM?||LMP-EVA|No, the one you deployed. The Rover high-gain antenna.||CDR-EVA|tty gosh, it blew up!||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|I thought we'd been hit by a - by a - Look at that stuff just keeps flying over the top of our heads. I thought we were the closest witnesses to a lunar meteor impact. I wonder if ... that's the same glass I picked up?||LMP-EVA|Oh, I don't know.||CC|John says it blew up on his mission too, guys.||LMP-EVA|Isn't that what you thought it was? Isn't that what you thought it was? Huh? I thought you were kidding.||CDR-EVA|No, I've never seen that before.||LMP-EVA|Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was -||CDR-EVA|No - you just - you just - Well, you saw that stuff coming. I didn't see that at all. Holy Smoly!||||Tape 81A/40||||CC|Roger, 17- And John says that it blew up on his mission, as well.||CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I guess I'm going to take the TV away from you.||CC|Okay. And, Gene, one thing we'd like before you guys leave the Rov - -||CDR-EVA|||CC|- - one thing we'd like before you guys leave the Rover is a fairly good description of what happened to the rear fender when it came off. Is the damage primarily to the piece that you've lost, or are the rails on the pieces remaining fairly bad?||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Mag - -||CDR-EVA|- the - -||LMP-EVA|#NAME?||CDR-EVA|Well, a piece of the rail on the - on the aft - aft inboard side here - the rail isn't missing - it's just a piece of the flange - the rail that fits against the fender - but that doesn't hold any part of the fender on. I don't remember what I saw on the fender - The rails look pretty good, Bob. And I had one of them completely on, and I just couldn't get the other one on. If I had known what that dust was, I would have tried an awful lot harder.||CC|Okay, do you have any feeling that - -||CDR-EVA|I heard John telling me, but - -||CC|Do you have any feeling that you could get away with putting a front fender on?||CDR-EVA|Well, I have done it before, but it's not easy.||CC|Okay, as far as you can tell, so that we can look at it over night, the rear fender - the part that's remaining - looks in fairly good shape, right?||||||Tape 8lA/4l||CDR-EVA|Let me take a good look at it. Yes, the part you need, I think, to hold that fender on -||LMP-EVA|Let's see - we better take those dustbrushes up there.||CDR-EVA|Yes, there's enough here to hold the fender on, Bob.||CC|Okay, we'll take a look at it here while you're sleeping.||CDR-EVA|Okay, let me get some breakers here. LRV breakers Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta.||LMP-EVA|Bob, while you were talking, I got all the mags -Romeo, Alfa, Bravo, Charlie.||CC|Hotel. Hotel.||LMP-EVA|That's on a magazine. That's on our camera.||CC|Okay. Got you on that one; you're right.||LMP-EVA|Is it not?||CC|You're right; my fault - you've got the maps, too.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I need those maps, Gene. Could you hand me the maps ?||CDR-EVA|I don't know. Pretty good clip, splitting apart a bit, too, aren't they?||LMP-EVA|Getting hot.||CDR-EVA|This thing keeps falling out of your clip, in case you're interested, or I keep knocking it. out.||LMP-EVA|Put it down here. Okay, I've got the maps, the 500 mag, yes - and the three - two cameras.||CC|Okay, we'll have to get the contamination bags, too, there.||CDR-EVA|Huh?||||Tape 81A/42||||LMP-EVA|Say that again, Bob.||CC|Roger. We've got the contamination bags to get, too - out of the MESA.||LMP-EVA|I've got them.||CC|Okay; copy that.||LMP-EVA|Mentioned that earlier.||CC|Sorry about that.||LMP-EVA|They're in there.||CC|Okay; do you know when you're brushing LCRU, we'd like the blankets left at 100 percent rather than 65 percent - we'd like them all left open; and it's been a little warm, also.|05 00 53 56|CDR-EVA|Okay, Bob, I've already dusted everything. And it all looks pretty good. The bay - the breakers are OPEN; the LCRU power is OFF ... Where do you want the TV camera? Do you want it tilted down and aft?||CC|Roger. Down and away from the Sun, like we talked about. Think that's what you mean by aft.||CDR-EVA|That's what I thought. Okay. It's down - yes, it's there.||CC|Okay; can you confirm that that's 100 percent on the LCRU blanket rather than 65 percent as per the checklist?||CDR-EVA|Yes, sir; I sure can.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm opening all the battery covers. The batteries are not dirty. I've been dusting the covers every stop.||CC|Okay; good.||LMP-EVA|Are you through - are you through with the SRC?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I just left it there.||||||Tape 81A/43||LMP-EVA|I've got to get to the table.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Okay, the batteries look pretty good. Bob, you got -you got - The left-hand forward reflector on the batteries is about 10 percent in shade. The others are in the Sun. Is that what you want?||CC|Stand by. Okay; that sounds right, they say.||CDR-EVA|Okay, the LCRU has been dusted; everything is dusted. Our blankets are open 100 percent. ... I'll check. Battery covers, open; LCRU blanket is open 100 percent; samples off. You got them all off, Jack?||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|And anything else? Let me look around. I got to get the TGE.||LMP-EVA|Check it one more time.||CDR-EVA|Samples off; let's look under here. There's nothing tinder here. This bag is empty. Those are sample bags.||LMP-EVA|Okay, we do not bring up the LM ECS canister. Is that correct?||CC|That's correct, 17-||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CC|And, Jack, confirm you have the scissors in the ETB. Roger.||LMP-EVA|Just a second. (Laughter) Yes, sir. Thank you, again.||CDR-EVA|Okay, ... the old blanket.|05 00 56 39|LMP-EVA|Okay, that pin's green; that pin's green. Both pins are green.||CC|Copy that.||||Tape 81A/44||||CDR-EVA|Boy, that's dirty.||LMP-EVA|Okay. Okay, I'll take some stuff up. SCB 2, we don't have. Oh, wait a minute. What did we decide to do - -||CC|SCB 2 for the big rock there, Jack.||LMP-EVA|Put that big rock in the - Oh, okay.||CDR-EVA|How's our time, Bob?||CC|No problem on time.||LMP-EVA|A little in on those ... Can I sneak in and get a bag?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|See you later, Rover.||CDR-EVA|Okay, the SEP blankets are open; it is dusted. Okay, and I verify that the DSEA is OFF, and the power's OFF.||CC|Copy that, Gene; thank you.||CDR-EVA|Okay, you want the TGE, right side of the MESA, but in the shade. Okay.||CC|That's affirm.||CDR-EVA|Boy, did it get covered with dust, too.||CDR-EVA|Bob, no trouble with the TGE in the TV, huh?||CC|None so we can tell. We'll get another reading here when we see it on the ground here.||CDR-EVA|Hey, Jack, if I set this here, we'll - Jack?||LMP-EVA|What?||CDR-EVA|Okay, I just want to set it here so you don't knock it over.||LMP-EVA|What's that?||||||Tape 81A/45||CDR-EVA|The TGE, right where you left foot is.||LMP-EVA|Oh, well.||CDR-EVA|I'm afraid we'll knock it over if I set it anywhere else.||LMP-EVA|Well, stand by; I've got a lot of stuff here.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|You should have volunteered to take the big bag in.||CDR-EVA|Why? You having trouble getting that thing in?||LMP-EVA|Oh, it's just ... Yes, I'm having trouble.||CDR-EVA|Well, here; let me help you.||LMP-EVA|Hold this big bag, please.||CDR-EVA|Just don't back up if you can help it.||LMP-EVA|Hold the bag. This big one, this one. No, the other one, the other one; don't.||CDR-EVA|I can't ...||LMP-EVA|I got it. That's a big rock.||CDR-EVA|... fit there is long ways.||LMP-EVA|Okay, there should be another one in there. Is there? Feel it, squeeze it, hit it.||CDR-EVA|... the box, see if there's any in there.||LMP-EVA|||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Well, let's leave it. ... let's get it out. Here, pick it up. We'll get it out.||CDR-EVA|Hold the top.||||Tape 81A/46|||05 01 00 39|LMP-EVA|Shake it. Well, I thought there was one in there.||CDR-EVA|I don't think there's anything in there.||LMP-EVA|I thought I put one in there.||CDR-EVA|Okay.||LMP-EVA|Well, I guess not. If I did, it's gotten out. Okay, got away.||CDR-EVA|Okay, I'm going to leave the TGE right here. I'll put the TGE right side of MESA. Okay, I might give them a gravimeter reading, believe it or not. Boy, I'll tell you, the only thing bad about putting this thing on the ground - it's like everything else - you have to bend over to get at it. And you need support to get back up. Okay.|05 01 01 18|CDR-EVA|MARK, gravimeter.||CC|Roger. Mark.||CDR-EVA|And she's flashing, Bob.||CC|Thank you.||LMP-EVA|Okay, I'm supposed to take this and the core stem bag up there.||CDR-EVA|I'll get it for you.||LMP-EVA|Can you get the core stem bag?||CDR-EVA|Yes, I'll get it for you.||LMP-EVA|Okay, you got a core stem bag?||CDR-EVA|Yes, let me give it one zap with the brush.||LMP-EVA|Okay. I didn't mean to drop that, but I did.||CDR-EVA|Yes, we got to - we got to keep from dropping everything. I'll tell you, the big lesson today - -||||||Tape 81A/47||LMP-EVA|Dropped.||CDR-EVA|Dropped, I guess.||LMP-EVA|The big lesson is that it's going to get dropped if your hands get tired.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|... come down. Got it.||CDR-EVA|Okay. Me see. Okay, the TGE is reading. We got to stow our antennas and ... dusting down here. I'll make a check of what you've got up there. What have you got up there so far?||LMP-EVA|Just the SRC 2 and the core steins.||CDR-EVA|Okay, SRC 2 and the core stems. Okay- Where's EVA pallet?||LMP-EVA|It's on the MESA table.||CDR-EVA|Okay, that's good; that's ready. Where's ETB? That's ready to go up.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||CDR-EVA|Okay, core stem bag, SRC 2; SRC 1 is in the - SCB 1 is in SRC 1. ... It's there. Big bag is not required. Okay, any more room up there? If not, why don't -||LMP-EVA|No, I think - -||CDR-EVA|Why don't I dust you here.||LMP-EVA|Okay. This rock you laid it on here.||CDR-EVA|Watch your foot; you're caught in that thing.||LMP-EVA|Yes.||||Tape 81A/48||||CDR-EVA|Pick up your right foot. Jack, you're just going to have to get up on that ladder somewhere so I don't - don't get the dust all over this thing.||LMP-EVA|Well, I've got to dust you, too.||CDR-EVA|Well, okay. Go ahead and get me.||LMP-EVA|Yes, where's your brush?||CDR-EVA|Right on the hook.|05 01 04 18|LMP-EVA|Right; see what I can do. Kick most of it off, I hope.||CDR-EVA|You have to go anywhere else, now?||LMP-EVA|Just right around here; no place but right around here. Man! That's a - that's like a super-endless task.||CDR-EVA|Get the top of that thing if you can.||LMP-EVA|Oop - oop. It landed on a slope.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Okay. That's good.||CDR-EVA|About the arms?||LMP-EVA|Yes, hold them up and shake them, too, in case there's anything down in them?||CDR-EVA|Let me just - Yes.||LMP-EVA|Let me get lower so you can get at me. Okay, how's that? At best, it is going to be bad but we want to get as much off as we can.||CDR-EVA|How about this one?||LMP-EVA|Guess I can come around on the other side, if you want.||CDR-EVA|Yes, I can hold on better that way.||||||Tape 81A/49||LMP-EVA|Just take some of it off.||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|Hold still.||CDR-EVA|I'll get up on that ladder and you get a whack at my legs, best you can. And I'll kick my boots clean.||LMP-EVA|That fender is really going to be a nuisance.||CDR-EVA|Mean going?||LMP-EVA|I'm going to have to get you to bend over, too, so I - not now. Know there's a lot on the OPS.|05 oi o6 45|CDR-EVA|I just will stow - my antenna while you're up there.||LMP-EVA|Oh, boy! That's really putting the finishing touches on the old arms, isn't it?||CDR-EVA|Yes.||LMP-EVA|How'd you get so dirty?||CDR-EVA|Wait until I show you the picture I took of you.||LMP-EVA|Didn't. Okay, Gene. Most of what's left is up on your - get your antenna. Oh, you're going to go up there, first.||CDR-EVA|You want -||LMP-EVA|Okay.||CDR-EVA|I don' t know how you do that.||LMP-EVA|Just - just really spring. You got it.

We're trying to go over this thing pretty thoroughly.||CC|Okay.||CDR-EVA|Pocket is fairly full of dirt.||LMP-EVA|That brush does pretty good, though.||CDR-EVA|Want me to move, or anything now?||LMP-EVA|No.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I'm just a mess. Course, when I do this, I get dirtier.||LMP-EVA|Yes.|05 01 08 34|CDR-EVA|Once I get you this far, I'm just going to shove you on up that ladder and not let you get in the dust.

The two things on the surface yet are the ETB and the SRC and me.||CC|Okay, we copy that.

Yes, we had a lot of turning points.||CDR-EVA|Do you want the LEC in there? You don't, do you?||CC|Negative, you can leave the LEC outside.||LMP-LM|No, just the bag.||CDR-EVA|Where are the scissors, by the way?||||Tape 82A/8||||LMP-LM|They're in the bag.||CDR-EVA|Okay. I hope they don't come out this time.||LMP-LM|Well, I stuck them down in there. I hope they don't.||CC|Yes, Jack - -||LMP-LM|We'll have to figure out something else if they do.||CC|#NAME?||LMP-IM|I think so, Bob. I'll take a peek down there.

Move your right -your left arm.||CDR-LM|(Laught er) Where ? Okay.||LMP-LM|There.||CDR-LM|Okay. Let me make sure there's nothing in that hatch.||LMP-LM|Well, there's dust.

What we really had to get out there on. Boy, look at that visor. No wonder I couldn't see.||CDR-LM|Jack, do you read?||LMP-LM|Yes.||CDR-LM|Okay, I thought you knocked your thing to AR - -||CDR-LM|- - or to A or something. There's a lot of noise in the background. That's why I was wondering. Need some help?||LMP-LM|Stow the visors, huh? What is it?||CDR-LM|Yes, stow them in the BRA.||LMP-LM|No, but I mean - Keep the protective visor down.||||Tape 82A/16||||CDR-LM|Keep the protective visor over it, and stow the whole thing in the BRA.||CDR-LM|Verify safety on the dump valve. I guess I can do that now -|05 01 39 39|LMP-LM|Again?||CDR-LM|That one's still safe. And that one's still safe.||LMP-LM|That was like gunpowder, just like the boys said.||CDR-LM|Oh, it does, doesn't it?|05 01 39 54|CDR-LM|Okay, DESCENT WATER valve, OPEN. Oh, boy. I ran out of water out there. I mean the drinking kind.||LMP-LM|Okay, what's next?||CDR-LM|Okay, DESCENT WATER valve, OPEN.|05 01 40 24|LMP-LM|Okay. Coming OPEN.||CDR-LM|Okay, and then you get your purge valve out.||LMP-LM|It's too hard ...||CDR-LM|... (Laughter)||CDR-LM|"(Laughter) „ If they say anything, just say, ""I told you so."" Okay. Remove your purge valve - -"||LMP-IM|(Laughter)||CDR-IW|#NAME?||LMP-LM|Yes, sir (laughter). If I can. Okay.||CDR-LM|I tell you, I haven't seen anything - Drilling those holes was a piece of cake until I couldn't get that core tube out. I thought that whole - -||LMP-LM|I'm glad there were - -||CDR-LM|I thought that - -||||||Tape 82A/17||LMP-LM|I'm glad there were two of us.||CDR-LM|I thought that whole thing was going to break. It was bending about - at about (laughter)||LMP-LM|Well, next time we have to do it -||CDR-LM|Yes.||LMP-LM|Let's see, OPS. That must be this one.||CDR-LM|Disconnect OPS hose. Connect LM hoses - red to red, blue to blue.||LMP-LM|I don't want LM hoses yet. I'll just get on water right away.||CDR-LM|Let1s put -|05 01 4l 01|LMP-LM|I'm going to - DIVERTER valve, horizontal.|05 01 41 05|CDR-LM|SUIT ISOL, both. I'm going SUIT FLOW, get some flow in this cabin. Okay.||LMP-LM|Here, you want me to get it?||CDR-LM|I tell you, my hands, after working - at - picking up little things.||LMP-LM|I feel the same way. I think you had the worst of it.||CDR-LM|Hey, let's keep as much dust out of those connectors as we can (laughter). Wise guy.||LMP-LM|Okay. Let's wait on these.||CDR-LM|Okay, your diverter valve horizontal?||LMP-LM|Yes. And if we - ~||CDR-LM|Okay, and if you can get to the SUIT FLOW, you can go SUIT FLOW. In the meantime, get your FAN -your PUMP OFF.||||Tape 82A/18|||05 01 42 08|LMP-LM|FAN's OFF. PUMP's OFF.||CDR-LM|Joe, are you still reading us down there?||CC|Loud and clear, Gene. We're following you close and - -||CDR-LM|Okay. I just wanted to see whether you were there.||CC|Roger. Following you close here.||LMP-LM|Keep us honest.||CDR-LM|Okay, we're just looking at 5 psi and all the hatches are battened down, and the safeties are on. You can keep a look at the rest of it for us.||CC|Copy that. And we're saying the same thing -||CDR-LM|Okay, disconnect your PLSS water. Now what I do, Jack, is - I was going to say put your cover on, but we're going to stow those.||CDR-LM|Okay, guess we've got to go off the air for a little while. We're both going 0,||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|And we'll get on our LM comm here, shortly.|05 01 42 53|CC|Roger. Check back in.|05 01 44 49|LMP-LM|... Okay, we got to do some more switching, yet.|05 01 44 51|CDR-LM|Okay. Connect the - Okay. Now in - AUDIO circuit breakers CLOSED. Now, both panels, VHA - VHF A, RECEIVE; B, OFF. Okay. MODE ICS/PTT.|05 01 46 01|CDR-LM|Hello, Houston. Do you read Challenger on LM comm?||CC|Okay, Challenger. This is Houston. Reading you 5 by.||CDR-LM|Okay, we're going to go ahead and charge up the -let's see, the LMPs - PLSS.||||||Tape 82A/19||CC|We copy.|05 01 52 56|LMP-LM|Hello, Houston. The recharge on the LMP: 95 percent.|05 01 53 03|CC|Copy that.|05 01 59 ^0|CDR-LM|Hello, Houston. It's CDR with a recharge of 93 percent.|05 01 59 U5|CC|Sounds good, Geno.|05 02 08 18|LMP-LM|Okay, Houston. OPS pressures: LMP, 6l00, and CDR, 5900.||CC|Thank you, Jack.|05 02 18 01|CDR-LM|Joe, we're changing a cartridge out in my PLSS. We've got the battery changed.||CC|Okay, Geno; thank you.||CDR-LM|You don't have a cold something or other, do you?||CC|I'm sorry you even mentioned it.||LMP-LM|We can think about it, can't we?||CC|Mercy, yes.||LMP-LM|Hey. Does Captain America know all about this?||CC|Roger, Jack. He does. He's been fully advised, and his response is - he's sound asleep, now.||LMP-LM|Yes. I forgot. He was going to bed before we did today.||LMP-LM|Did he have a good day up there?||CC|He surely did. Fine day. And I want to make the observation - as a casual bystander. It was a real pleasure to watch your EVA unfold down here.||||Tape 82A/20|||05 02 19 55|CDR-LM|Thank you, Joe. I think you are more than a casual bystander though-|05 02 27 23|CDR-LM|Hey, Joe. We've got - 1 and 3 - or correction, l's replacing the 3s and 2's replacing the 4s on the PLSS.||CC|We copy.|05 02 30 51|LMP-LM|Joe, we're in the right-hand column of 3-3 now.||CC|Roger.|05 02 35 24|LMP-LM|Joe, bag - collection bag 2 is 16.||CC|Thank you.|05 02 35 01|LMP-LM|And the SRC is 32 pounds.||CC|Copy; 32 pounds.|05 02 37 03|CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. The HEATER is ON for the dump.|05 02 37 10|CC|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 83A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 02 41 51|LMP-LM|Okay, Joe. The circuit breakers are verified. On both 11 and l6, with the exception of the line heater.||CC|Okay, copy that. Thank you very much.||LMP-LM|Okay, Houston, we're going to turn the BIOMED, OFF|05 02 44 12|CC|Okay.|05 03 06 44|LMP-LM|Houston, Challenger. We'll both be off the air briefly here as we swing into getting our suits and LCGs off. The Commander presently has his suit off, and I'll start on mine.||CC|Roger, Jack.|05 03 29 43|CDR-LM|Hello, Joe; you there?||CC|Waiting patiently.||CDR-LM|Okay, if you*re keeping score on the bottom of 3-4, we're both out of our suits. And does that feel good.||CC|Roger, Gene. Thank you.||CDR-LM|Okay, I'm out of icy LCG, if you want to turn the page.||CC|Okay, Geno, and how are your hands feeling?||CDR-LM|Oh, they're a little tired. On both sides, here.||CC|Can't imagine -||CDR-LM|But I think they'll pull through.||CDR-LM|Do I read this that the - that the LMP sleeps on bio tonight? Is that right?||CC|Stand by. Roger; that's affirm.||||Tape 83A/2||||CDR-LM|Okay, so I can take mine off, huh? Ify sensors?||CC|That's affirm, Gene.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|Well, we'll - we'll be up to the EVA debriefing time here very shortly.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|Joe, do you know how much time has elapsed since we initially charged our PLSS's with O2?||CC|Geno, it's time to charge them again, if you want to.||CDR-LM|Okay, I just might pick that up.||CC|All righty.||CDR-LM|We'll let you know where we are, though.||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|Say, Joe, I guess the home front was probably listening in. Any one talked to them?||CC|Haven't talked to them today, Geno. I haven't at least.||CDR-LM|Hello, boss, how are you doing down there?||CC|Just, fine. Waiting for you guys to go to sleep so we can do the same. Had a great day up there, guys.||CDR-LM|Oh, you don't have to wait for that. We're - it was super from here - it's quite an experience, Deke, and quite a challenge.||CC|Yes, it looked beautiful from here.||CDR-LM|I tell you it makes you feel - feel like you had a good day's work behind you, though.||||||Tape 83A/3|05 03 34 42|CC|I can believe that.||CC|We're about to give you the rest of the day off, Gene.||CDR-LM|Thank you, Joe.||CC|Geno - While you troop are -||CDR-LM|Hey, it's 3 o'clock in the - -||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Go ahead, Joe I was just going to say, it's 3 o'clock in the morning back there.||CC|We know it.||CC|It's 3 o'clock in the morning up there, too.||CDR-LM|Yes (chuckle) and we know that too.||CC|Troops, while you're in a listen mood up there, we're going to be coining at you with a number of items here, not too many, but the first will be some surface block data. Then we're going to read up to you a LEVA cleaning procedure which is fairly simple, a real short geology debrief, a one-line change in the Lunar Surface Checklist. And then, we've been doing some thinking down here about how to fix the fender. And it's going to involve, we think, although we'll work on it while you guys are getting some rest, it's going to involve using utility clamps, from inside your LM there, instead of tape, to fasten some sort of stiff material onto the Rover in place of the missing fender. And we'll go with either with one of your - your cue cards, or possibly with part of insulation that, was the flame blanket protecting the Rover during the landing. Or perhaps part of the packing material that was between the Rover wheel and is probably lying on the ground underneath the LM there.||||Tape 83A/4||||CDR-LM|Joe, you couldn't be reading our mind more. We were talking about that, and there is a piece of it right outside my window. I saw it after we got in here. Either that or back of a part of a data book or something - I hate like the devil to tear one of those other fenders off. And the reason tape won't stick is that everything's got a fine coating of dust, and the only way I could finally get it to stick was to put tape on it -rip the tape off - or take the tape off - which took some of the dust off and then tape would tend to hold it. But it just won't hack it up here.||CC|Roger, Gene. That's exactly what we're thinking. And what we're going to do is run through the fix in a pressure suit a few hours from now. And if it looks like we can do it, and it won't cost you many more than say 10 minutes, we're going to have you go through with it. If it takes longer than that, we're going to go back to the drawing board and see what else we can do here.||CDR-LM|Well, you know John and Charlie can tell you just had bad it is. I wouldn't have believed it - I guess I didn't believe it, or I would have worked a little harder to make sure that fender was going to stay on. But it - Man, just that short trip back from where we lost it, and we were just covered. The whole - I couldn't even read the parts of the panel on the Rover, plus all the battery covers and everything.||CC|Roger, Gene. What we really need, I think, is some white mud flaps up there.||CDR-LM|That's a little too old fashioned, Joe.||CC|I guess we'd know wouldn't we?||CDR-LM|I'm afraid so.|05 03 39 56|CDR-LM|Okay, Joe.||CDR-LM|MARK. I'm giving my PLSS a second charge right now.|||||CC|Tape 83A/5 We're watching.||CDR-LM|You sure of that? You should be getting LMP biomed.||CDR-LM|And Joe, give me a hack after about 10 minutes in case I forget on that PLSS recharge.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|Can I do both the - I can do both the water recharge and the 0p recharge at the same time, can't I?||CC|That1s affirm.||CDR-LM|Okay.||CC|Gene, I caution not to tilt the PLSS while you're doing that.||CDR-LM|Yes, good idea. Mine's in the station.||CC|And, Gene, if - if you want to get the geology debrief out of the way anytime, just give us a whistle on that.||LMP-LM|Joe, why don't you give - give me the block data* and then we can go on that geology brief?||CC|Okay, are you ready to copy?||LMP-LM|Go ahead?|05 03 43 03|CC|Okay, Jack surface block data; lift-off times, T21, 128 plus 47 plus 12; T22, 130 plus 45 plus 44; T23, 132 plus 44 plus l8; T24, 134 plus 42 plus 50; T25, 136 plus 4l plus 28. Over.||LMP-LM|Okay, Joey, 21, reading in order 128:47:12; 130:45:44; 132:44:18; 134:42:50; 136:41:28. And what's the present rev?||CC|Present rev is 20, and readback is correct.||||Tape 83A/6||||LMP-LM|Okay, Joe, you can go ahead and fire away at the LMP.||CC|Okay, Jack, and for the geology questions. I'm going to turn the console over to the well-known geologist of the Seifort Galaxies.||MP-m|Can't hack it, huh? You've all forgotten everything I taught you.||CC|I draw my sword.||CC|Okay, guys, you want me to address first those to Gene - those to Jack, and then address them to Gene later on, or you guys both, want to answer them at the same time?||LMP-LM|Well, we're both listening. We can answer them.||CC|Okay, the way you asked that, I wasn't sure.||CC|Okay. Question number 1 is - concerns the Rover mobility rate. The Rover mobility rates over the short span you drove, which is hardly representative, are slower than people had anticipated. Do you think this is due to visibility, terrain, or what? Do you think you can still hack a 7*3 or 8-kilometer minimum or average to Station 2 tomorrow?||CDR-LM|The answer to that is yes, Bob. I think it's partly - partly fam, but it's also the fact that we did a lot of circling. We didn't drive in many straight lines. Trying to find, for the most part, our bearings, and tried to pick some high spots so we could look around. So I think straight-line navigation out in the area we're going is going to be easily 8 kilometers.||CC|Okay, great. Okay. Another question here, Gene, that you should be able to answer with a simple yes or no. Was there any spillage of the material in the drill core while you were breaking it down?||||||Tape 83A/7||CDR-LM|Simple no.||CC|Okay. And - -||CDR-LM|Spillage out of it?||CC|- - Yes, you know, when you broke the sections, did you lose much material out of it?||CDR-LM|No, sir; I didn't lose any.||CC|Okay, next simple question. When you were drilling the deep core where the neutron probe was, could you see the RTG over the rock?||CDR-LM|Yes.||CC|Okay. You have any feel for how high the rock is or how low - how deep the thing was with respect to the - with respect to the RTG? Where you down in a level that was below, even without the rocks being there?|05 03 48 10|CDR-LM|Yes, I think I - yes. I was in a - in a slump. There was a ridge between us and the RTG, and I had the rock in a line of sight between it and where I put that core. And I'd say the rock was certainly near the ridge and it was - what, Jack? -I don't know was it meter to - meter higjh for the most part. And it sloped off, and I'd say at least a half a meter high in the line of sight from where the neutron probe is to the - to the RTG. Plus, there's a lot of undulations - I think it'll be below the line of sight, anyway.||CC|Okay. And a somewhat more general question, here. It says - and I'll read it. We're still puzzled as to whether there is a dark mantle. Could you say something more about the dark regolith surface? There's a lot of discussion, today, about whether or not it could have been a regolith derived from the intermediate gabbro which you were sampling as boulders.||||Tape 83A/8||||CDR-LM|Bob, I - I think I don't have too much to add to what I said, near the end of the EVA, is that I do not have an intuitive feeling that the regolith has been derived from most of the boulders that we're seeing. But - because those boulders are fairly light-colored, they look like they're probably 50 percent plagioclase. The - it could be that the regolith is derived from some other material that has blanketed the area. I don't think we have that answer, yet.||CC|Okay. I copy that.||CDR-LM|Bob, the boulders - the boulders we are sampling -I think Jack, and I both feel that it's probably -we feel we sampled the subfloor because we saw on the sides of the craters where some of these boulders were exposed almost as if they were bedrock down there. In driving back from what we called Station 1, we - we could definitely see the light mantle out in the area where the potentials of a slide are.||CC|Okay, very good. Yes, I think that the - At least, it's a going bet around here that we're sampling the subfloor when we're sampling - at least the top of the subfloor when we're sampling the intermediate gabbro there. The rocks and the boulders.||CC|Okay. We also - -||CDR-LM|Yes, the -||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Bob.||CC|Go.||LMP-LM|It is sort of strange that we don't see a good population of fine - of finer-grained rocks. These rocks look very much like igneous rocks, but||||||Tape 83A/9||CC|they're considerably coarser than comparable -well, they're about the grain size of some of the coarse-grain Mare basalts that tend to differentiate the crystallobalite and tridymite - but we didn't see any of the finer-grain versions. If it's an intermediate crystalline rock, we have not seen any fine-grain equivalents yet. At least not in abundance. Okay, I copy that.||CC|We get - we gather that there's no color change in the dark-mantle material at depth. In other words, the footprints, wheel tracks, and the rake sample, et cetera, were sort of uniform in color.||LMP-LM|No, there's no major change, but looking out the window and I think I commented on it, the disturbed regolith is darker. Oh, I don't know, maybe by 10 percent albedo, something like that, than the undisturbed surface.||CC|Okay, I remember your commenting that when you were walking to the ALSEP, I think, Jack, in fact.||CC|Okay, during drilling of the heat flow holes, Gene - -||CDR-LM|That's right.||CC|#NAME?||CDR-LM|Yes, Bob, both in the core and the heat flow holes, it really didn't - didn't seem to pile it up like you're accustomed to it at the Cape, and I guess maybe that's because I was kicking so much dust around there. But I looked specifically when I cleared flutes, and what have you, and I didn't 3ee any difference in terms of color, texture, or anything else coming up.||CC|Okay, copy that.||||Tape 83A/10|||05 03 53 04|CC|On the - outcrops you think you see in the North and South Massifs, do they appear to be linear horizontal, or subhorizontal? Can you see layers, and do you have any feel for the thickness or the attitude or the continuity of them? Can you discuss these outcrops?||CDR-M|Bob, the -going over yesterday, I thought I could see a - a structure dipping off to the southeast, apparent dip anyway, on the eastern side of the South Massif. Or northeastern side. We haven't examined them in detail because we were in a rush to get out. We'll put the binoculars on them and try to examine that question. There1s nothing very obvious, any more than you can see on the photos, that the ledges were concentrated in the upper portion (cough) - excuse me - in the upper portion of the Massif's units.||CC|"Okay- We copy that. Here's a short one that I'll ask Jack since he did it. Again I guess we'll have to prove this - the shade portion of the cosmic ray experiment. The question is, and I repeat - I quote - ""Are you sure that the detectors, not the decals, were facing out?î"||LMP-LM|I am, Bob, because I said I was sure, and I called you on it.||CC|Roger. I was sure, too, but I had to ask the question.||LMP-LM|I - I under - I know. I understand why it was asked, because I did it wrong at the Cape. But that's why - that's why I mentioned it when I deployed it.||CC|Roger.||CC|And ready to - Okay, and we can go and recharge the other PLSS whenever you're ready there, guys.||LMP-LM|Okay.||||||Tape Q3A/11||CC|Okay, the next question which calls for a little bit of discussion is: The layers of lineaments that you remarked on in the Sculptured Hills, can you say anything about them?||CDR-LM|Yes, Bob, I did. I think I said - and I commented, I'm not sure whether it was the Sun angle or not, but see, I was not looking at the Sculptured Hills. I was looking back at Bare Mountain, I believe. And, to me it looked like there was some organization that was dipping back to the east, somewhere between, oh, 20 and 25 degrees maybe. And it was very obvious to me but I'm a little - a little hesitant because of some of this Sun-angle stuff.||CC|Okay, I copy that. I gather we didn't get any 500-millimeters of these lineations, that right?||CDR-LM|No, but I think we will. I - they were on the western side of Bare Mountain back there, and I think I commented that I thought that Bare Mountain is probably what the Sculptured Hills look like.||CC|Okay, I copy that. Is there a scar above the light mantle material? In other words the slide, is there a scar above that on the South Massif? Can you see anything up there to indicate that it might have come off of there?||CDR-LM|Nothing obvious yet 5 Bob.||CC|Okay, copy that. On the way back to Station 1, you described a small crater with light material on the bottom* Can you say anything more about that crater?||LMP-LM|Bob, I don't remember saying that, or Gene doesn't either.||CC|Okay. You talked about something that was light I don't remember - I thought it was a boulder, but the question's about a crater.||||Tape 83A/12||||LMP-LM|You're right. You're right, there was a large zap pit in a boulder that was very white. It must have been - the crater for the zap must have been 2 centimeters diameter anyway. And it had about that, or maybe 3-centimeters worth of crushed minerals around it, that gave it a vhite, very bright white appearance.||CC|Okay. Well that was indeed a srnll crater, so I guess the question was right.|05 03 57 59|CC|Let me change the mode here and ask you three or four simple ALSEP questions again, to verify for various people, exactly what happened. Just to make sure that they're clear on it. When - Jack, when, you were laying out the geophone leads, you mentioned and asked me if it was all right if the geophone leads crossed one another, if there was EMI problems. And so that made people wonder whether or not it was possible the geophone positions were reversed; i.e., geophone 1 was laid out in geophone 2s' direction, et cetera.|-|LMP-LM|No, that was just a geophone 4 problem. The geophones are in the right directions.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|Geophone 4 fell out of the module and rolled under one of the other lines, or vice versa, I don't know which, and it was - it's crossing one of the other lines, geophone 1, I think.||CC|Okay, no problem. Was the - When you went to put the I£PE antenna in the heat-flow socket, you didn't have - weren't able to do it at first, was it because of there was a lot of dust in there?||LMP-M|No, I think it was the same old problem of that piece of - of aluminum foil or whatever it is going down in the socket and jamming briefly.||||||Tape 83A/13||CC|Okay, I copy that. Did you clear out that foil when you did it, or did you Just push it on through?||LMP-LM|I pushed it.||CC|Okay. When you taped the SEP solar cells down, did you - how much of them did you cover with tape?||LMP-LM|We taped the back.||CC|Ah, very good thinking. And, Geno, a question for you on the Rover when you parked it. Do you have any feeling for the roll angle it was parked at the IM? The roll angle?||CDR-LM|Here let me look. Bob, it's pretty flat. If I had to guess, I'd say zero. And you can bias that by a degree or so, but basically zero.||CC|Okay, is the pitch scale still on it, or did it fall off yet?||CDR-LM|No. I was going to comment on that. It' s still there.||CC|Okay, very good. Okay, when you went to Station. 1A, we're calling the new Station 1 -Station 1A, were the blocks there as well-filleted as those near the IM and the ALSEP? Do they all look the same?||CDR-LM|Bob, they - All the boulders had filleting to a slight degree, but not an extreme amount. I think it no more than what is being caused by the redistribution of the darker, fine-grained regolith.||CC|Okay, I copy that.||LMP-LM|Bob, if had to answer - -||CC|Go ahead.||||Tape 83A/14||||LMP-LM|- - if I had to answer that question, I'd say yes. Yes that the fillet - boulders are filleted over there about like they are over here. That would be my impression.||CC|All right. Is there any indication that the fillets are directional, in other words, that the fillets sire heavier on one side than the other?||CDR-LM|Bob, haven't noticed that.|05 04 01 49|CC|Okay, I copy that. Do you have the feeling that some boulders are more rounded||CDR-LM|Well that's a good -- that's a good -||CC|Roger. I agree with that.||CDR-LM|That's a good re - that's a good reminder, Bob.||CC|Okay, do have any feeling that some boulders are more rounded than others? Apparently this looked this way in some of the TV pictures.||CDR-LM|Some of the big ones that are just barely exposed above the regolith looked quite well-rounded. Most of those around the craters are sub angular. I think - I got the impression that it's Just purely a function of how long the same material's been exposed; but some of the big boulders like the one out near the geophones is quite angular in part and quite rounded on other parts. It's quite variable.||CC|Okay, do you want to say any more about that boulder? Did it seem to have more or less the same morphology, in addition to the variation in vesicle size that the other rocks in the vicinity of the ALSEP, and the other rocks out at Station 1 had?||LMP-LM|It's very comparable to the ones that we saw at Station 1, as a matter of fact.||||||Tape 83A/15||CC|Okay, I copy that.||CDR-LM|Both types of rocks were there, both variations.||CC|Do you have a feeling for where the big blocks in the LM ALSEP area came from? Do you think they were from Camelot, like I've been saying?||LMP-LM|Don't have an idea yet s I'in really not sure.||CC|Okay, and as you drove along on the traverse from the SEP to Station la did the size of the small craters with blocky rims vary? In other words, what we are looking for here is the variation in the thickness of the dark mantle?||LMP-LM|I can't answer that one yet, Bob.||CC|Okay. Let me sum up by saying, that I guess as I indicated before, our best guess is that the vesicular crystalline rock, probably gabbro, or I think you've been calling it intermediate basalt or gabbro, forms at least the upper part of the subfloor. I don't think we've been close enough to a large crater rim to say that it's a - what the deep sections of the subfloor form, but we think that this intermediate gabbro vesicular rock, at least medium-grained, perhaps coarsegrained rock, forms at least the upper layer of the subfloor. Over.||LMP-LM|Yes, Bob, I think that's pretty safe, right now. Once again, I'm surprised that it's as coarse as it is, that being the upper portion of a plains unit.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|Say, Bob, driving back from Station 1, driving back from Station 1, where we did some of our circling and what have you. We didn't have time to get off, but we did see down in - I don't remember whether it was in the slopes of some craters, or down on the slope itself, but I'd say several meters down below the inantle where there was s what we almost agreed to, might be bedrock at least, a deeper portion of the aubfloor.||||Tape 83A/16||||CC|Okay, well, I think we'll get to it tomorrow. I think I might just give you a clue to our thinking for tomorrow. But, I don't think we've seen, or done anything today that is going to make us change very much from the nominal station of - nominal EVA-2 plans. The fact we didn't get the station -to the EVA-1 at the large boulders at Emory is probably going to mean that Station 5 might be shifted a little bit to the boulders on Camelot. But certainly Station 5 on the subfloor and also to Station 10 have assumed a higjier priority than they originally had. Other than that I, don't think we'll see an awful lot of changes to EVA-2. Over.|05 04 06 15|LMP-LM|Okay, Bob. I think that's safe. I suppose somebody's thinking about the possibility of going down to Emory. Maybe you just said that. Going down to Emory late in EVA-3.||CC|I think at the moment they're thinking primarily they're going to Station 10, and not going to Station 1.||CC|Okay, Jack, I've wrested control -||LMP-LM|Some of your experts might - -||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-LM|#NAME?||CC|Okay.||CC|We'll tell them. I'll see you tomorrow, guys.||LMP-LM|Sleep well, Bob.|05 04 07 29|CDR-LM|Okay, I've just got one question, Bob, before you run off. Did the TGA perform okay, with the -with the camera on?|||END OF TAPE|||||APOLLO|Tape 84A/1 17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 04 07 39|CC|As far as I could tell, Geno, it did. As a matter of fact, I didn't see the gravimeter people afterwards to talk to them. But as far as I could tell, it did. We had one funny reading back at the LM very early when it was on the ground, which I'm at a loss to understand right off. But other than that everything seems to have gone very well. The readings were quite uniform in fact, which makes me think they went well.||CDR-LM|Okay, well, I'd like to leave it - You know it's a little change in my thinking - I'd like to leave it on the Rover if we can, although it's a piece of cake to take off. It's very difficult to lean over that bar without losing your balance and taking your - your readings and what have you. So if we can leave it on it would be far better.||CC|Roger. I was noticing that. And I also noticed the only three - three-ball reading we got was whsn it was on the ground.||CDR-LM|Yes.||CC|Gene and Jack, if you'll get Lunar Surface Checklist 3-5é I've got an easy change to read up to you.||CDR-LM|Go ahead.||CC|"Okay. After the line: ""Empty ETB As Follows,"" change the first line which reads, B&W Mag Golf In Forward RHSSC to read, B&W Mag Hotel In LCG Compartment. And then go into the next column, which begins, ""Stow In ETB."" Change the second line, which reads: LMP's Camera With B&W Mag Hotel to LMP's Camera With B&W Mag Golf. That's Mag G, ETB. Over."||CDR-LM|Got you. Hotel, stow it; and go out with Gulf.||||Tape 84A/2||||CC|"That's got it. And I've got a LEVA-cleaning procedure which maybe you could pencil in there. It's an easy three-step procedure. And I'll go ahead and read it step-by-step here. Step number 1 is tap LEVA base to remove loose dust. Step number 2 reads: If excess dust still remains, use a towel from the LM tissue dispenser, which has been wetted with water, and gently wipe the visor from the top to the bottom; that is, in one direction. And fold this towel after each wipe to keep the contact surface clean. There's a note. ""Take care not to wet the inside that is, the concave surface of the gold visor."" And the last step is: Allow it to air-dry. And that's it on the LEVA cleaning."|05 04 11 20|CDR-LM|Okay, Joe, we got that. The Commander's PLSS has had its final charge, and we're in the process of working on the LMPs PLSS now. I guess there's no way to verify how much water you've got in there except to go through the procedure.||CC|That's right, Geno. And we think you fellows have earned a good meal now, and maybe you can take the rest of the day off.||CDR-LM|Okay, Joe. Thank you.|05 04 17 45|LMP-LM|Okay, Joe. Just to bring you up to date on magazines. Mag Bravo has 77 frames.||CC|Okay.||LMP-LM|Mag Hotel has 83 frames.||CC|Roger.||CC|Jack, on your mag Hotel, we'd showed you all the way up to 183 at one time, on that. Did you miss the 1, this time?||LMP-LM|I may have clipped it out, Joe. 183, yes.||||||Tape 84A/3||CC|Okay, yes, you did clip it out, clipped it out cleanly. So thanks for verifying that.||LMP-LM|Joe, mag Romeo has 21 frames. And I took a few, random, and probably not very good 500-millimeter of the North and South Massifs - North and South Massifs.|05 04 22 46|CC|Okay, Jack, Thank you.||LMP-LM|And, Joe, verify that you want mag Charlie substituted for Mag Bravo on the CDRs camera.||CC|Stand by.||LMP-LM|Don't get me wrong. I think it's a good idea, Joe. Don't let everybody work all night on that one.||CC|Jack, I think the answer to that is yes. Per the checklist, by the way. That's the way we show it in our checklist here.||LMP-LM|Roger. We just have - probably have a - about 100 frames left on Bravo, so we'll just keep track of that.||CC|Jack, it'll go out later on - Bravo will - It's -apparently, it's kind of your backup magazine there.||LMP-LM|Okay.|05 04 25 30|CC|The reason being, we want to start that EVA-2 with a fresh mag.|05 04 30 31|LMP-LM|Hey, Joe. Bob told us earlier, the sounder looked like it was working.||CC|Gene and Jack, just a general comment on that. SIM bay's cooking along beautifully. We are getting lunar sounder data. It looks quite interesting. We've only got one or two annoying problems, but nothing major, that is with the SIM bay, not with the sounder. One of them being that we have our usual mapping camera extend problem. And we've just decided to leave it extended and it will serve it right if it gets a little contaminated with an occasional dump. And||||Tape 84A/4|||05 04 32 05|LMP-LM|I guess there's a minor problem with one of the big antennas. It didn't pass its retract check properly, so I guess it may have to be jettisoned when we do a plane change. Otherwise, things are working beautifully. Over. That sounds great, I'm glad to hear that.|05 05 02 56|LMP-LM|Houston, Challenger.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-LM|We're sort of around 27:30 in the checklist, more or less, and you want the POWER AMP and TM to high?||CC|Ready when you are. And, troops, are you raiding the pantry up there yet?||LMP-LM|Yes, we are. We've been hitting it as hard as we can. Okay, POWER AMP is going to PRIMARY and PCM to HIGH. And, while we're waiting for Gene to look at this computer, shall I do the battery management?||CC|Jack, stand by, until we get the high bit rate, on that battery management. And, a reminder, are you recharging that PLSS number 2 there, or have you taken that off the line?||LMP-LM|No, we're - we're through with that. We caught it with 10 minutes.||CC|Okay. We've got high bit rate now. Go ahead with battery management.||LMP-LM|Okay, we'll play it - Gene'll work the computer, and I'll work the batteries. And the ED volts are 37-2, both bateries.||CC|Thank you.|05 05 05 56|LMP-LM|Okay, you got POO and DATA, Joe.||||||Tape 84A/5|05 05 07 35|CC|Thank you.||LMP-LM|Okay, Joe, the battery management complete. How does the rest of the spacecraft look, what you can see of it?||CC|Okay, Jackie. Copy the battery management complete, and the Challenger's looking beautiful from down here.||LMP-LM|I guess you don't have telemetry on dust yet, huh?||CC|Negative on the dust. And the computer's yours. Sounds like you've got hay fever sensors, as far as that dust goes.||LMP-LM|It's come on pretty fast just since I came back. I think as soon as the cabin filters most of this out that is in the air, I'll be all right. But I didn't know I had lunar dust hay fever.||CC|It's funny they don't check for that. Maybe that's the trouble with the cheap noses, Jack.||LMP-LM|Could be. I don't know why we couldn't have gone and smelled some dust in the LRL just to find out.||CC|Goodness knows we've tried.||LMP-LM|Okay, I'll wait for your cue on the rest of it.||CC|Okay, Jack. TELEMETRY PCM - LO, and your POWER AMP - OFF, please.||LMP-LM|Roger.||CC|Challenger, this is Houston requesting D0WNV0ICE BACKUP, and then configure your ECS for sleep at your convenience.|05 05 10 51|LMP-LM|Okay, we're working in that direction. D0WNV0ICE BACKUP, now.||||Tape 84A/6||||CC|Okay, Jack and Gene. And, unless you've got questions, or we can help you out in some way, we'll say good night to you.||CDR-LM|Good morning.||CDR-LM|The reason I say that, Joe, it's going to be another 30 minutes or so anyway before we -probably more like an hour before we actually close our eyes.||CC|Roger, Gene. You think you'll be able to use about 30 more minutes of sleep tomorrow morning? What's your wish on that?||CDR-LM|Yes, I'd like to try to get the full amount. As I recall, tomorrow's a little bit flexible. If we get up 30 minutes late, it doesn't really hurt us.||CC|Sounds like a good way to proceed. We'll give you the full 8 hours. Good night, Geno. And, you do have a time pad in there, so it shouldn't hurt a thing.||CDR-LM|Yes, as long - the big object tomorrow is to get out, and get back in, and the same thing with the next day. I don't think we're really that time critical either day that we can't go an hour either way. And I think we'd prefer to have the full 8 tonight.||CC|Roger. We couldn't agree with you more. And if there's anyway we can be helping you now, just speak up.||CDR-LM|No, you've been doing - doing fine. We just got a little housecleaning we got to do that's going to take us - I expect we'll be an hour late, Joe.|05 05 21 56|LMP-LM|Hey, Joe.||CC|Go ahead.||||||Tape 84A/7||LMP-LM|Some ambiguity in your statement. You want us to use a tissue or a towel on that visor cleaning?||CC|Jack, they call it - they call it a towel, but it comes from the LM tissue dispenser, so I would interpret that to mean tissue.||LMP-LM|Well, you and I are thinking alike. But can you ask back there and find out?||CC|Asking right now.||CC|Jack, our guess was right on the cleaning of the visors there. We're to use a tissue from the LM tissue dispenser. And I've got an unrelated question for you. We're tracing water usage down here. Could you tell us, please, if you filled your drink dispensers - refilled the drink dispensers in the suit already? Over.||LMP-LM|That's affirm. We have.||CC|Okay. Thank you.||LMP-LM|We have been drinking quite a bit of water, Joe.|05 05 24 59|CC|Okay. Thank you.||LMP-LM|Houston; Challenger. How do you read?||CC|You're loud and clear. Go ahead.||LMP-LM|Joe, I just took a - quick look with the hand lens at that large rock I brought in, and I'11 -I don't think there's much more than 30 percent plagioclase. I'll go back - could be more of a standard basalt or gabbro. It has a fair proportion of ilmenite in it, I believe. There's a bright platelets - in the vugs or vesicles - of ilmenite. Now it could be that the glass - if the soil is very glassy, that it's developed the darker color from the contribution of the - of the basic minerals through the glass, particularly the iron and the titanium.||||Tape 84A/8|CC|Roger, Jack. Copy that. Sounds interesting.||LMP-LM|All it means is that we don't yet know the origin of the dark mantle.||CC|Roger.||LMP-LM|That rock - looks I may have, by accident, sampled the front side of one of the parting planes that I mentioned. Very, very sharply bounded on one side by a planar surface.|05 05 29 52|CC|Roger, Jack. Say again. You may have sampled by accident the side - the side of what?||LMP-LM|No, I didn't. I mentioned when I sampled it, it had one very planar surface, and looking at it more closely, it looks like one of those parting planes that I talked about even earlier in the EVA.||CC|Roger. Copy. Parting planes, thank you.||LMP-LM|It's like a parting shot.||CC|Of which you've been known to have an overabundance, by the way.||LMP-LM|Oh, I didn't know that.||CC|All us fast finishers do.||LMP-LM|That's right. You got to figure out what race you're in though, first, Joe.||CC|"I'm sure that Sherlock Holmes would have a suitable quotation to answer that, Jack. I just can't come up with it right now. Something like ""therein, Watson, lies the problem"" - -"||LMP-LM|That, in itself, is a singular event.||LMP-LM|But the dog did nothing in the nighttime, Joe.||||||Tape 84A/9||CC|And when you've examined all possibilities and eliminated all but the very improbable ones, then the improbable one must mean the truth.||LMP-LM|I told you, he was a good geologist, one of the experts on the soils of London. Not to mention their relationship to all kinds and brands of tobacco.||CC|Jack, maybe we better get off onto another vein. Surgeon's giving me a puzzled look over here. We may be getting in trouble.||LMP-LM|You want to talk about veins - now that's something an old ore geologist could talk about all night.||CC|Ore geologists and cardiologists alike.||LMP-LM|Thou strikest for the jugular.||CC|Jack, we running a contest down here to come up with a reply to that. We're getting a request, many requests, for a weather report. We've been missing your weather report and wonder what the weather is on the Moon right now.||LMP-LM|Well, the Moon's weather is clear and sunny. It's only scattered clouds, and all of those seem to be attached to the Earth.||CC|Except for a cloud of dust around the right rear wheel of the Rover, we've noticed.||LMP-LM|Yes, but dissipates in the morning warmth. Believe it or not, Joe, I'm going to be off the air briefly|05 05 35 15|CC|So far, I don't believe that.||LMP-LM|Well, if you don't get any heart beat for a little while, don't worry.|05 05 35 32|CC|Okay.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 85A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|03 06 22 37|LMP-LM|Joe, we're asleep.

Do you have any sort of - some kind of a ground truth wrap-up of the first EVA as far as the type of material they ran across down there and things like that?||CC|Ron, I kind of personally - on and off. Let me work on a good summary, and I'll come back to you on that.||CMP|Okay. Nothing elaborate but just - you know -||CC|Okay. Talking about the America though, your consumables - You're 3.8 percent high on RCS quantity. On the O2, well - all the points of the three tanks have fallen between the - the two sets of lines on your graph with a total result as on 02 you're about 10 pounds below the average quantity expected. However, your trend is paralleling the lines and that's of absolutely no concern. On hydrogen, by best guess is you're probably a little bit high, total. Your Tank 1 is right on the line; Tank 2 is - oh, about 6 or 7 percent high; and Tank 3 is about 4 percent high, so you're fat on hydrogen.

Had about 6 hours of good sleep. Took me about an||||||Tape 86B/3|||hour to get things squared away last night. Then I woke up early this morning. Didn't take any medication. And I had four cans of fluid.||CC|Okay.||CMP|Okay, on the menu. Did I give you day 5, meal A, yesterday or not?||CC|I guess you did not.||CMP|Okay.

Yes, for the bottom one there, I had turkey and gravy, and an orange beverage, and if I find my chocolate bar, I'm going to eat it today* But I didn't eat it yet. Oh, yes, and I had the vitamins yesterday too.||CC|Okay, Ron.|05 09 52 09|CC|Ron, if you'd like, I could give you a summary of the EVA-1. I'm just sort of editing the report put out by the back room on that.||CMP|Sure. Go ahead, Gordo; Appreciate it.||CC|Okay. I'll read a few selected excerpts here. The surface around the landing site is generally an undulating plain, which was somewhat rougher and had a greater abundance of blocks than was expected by the astronauts. It is saturated with small craters not exceeding a few centimeters in size but not with larger craters. Small craters commonly have glass on their floors. Boulders ranging from about 1/2 meter to 4 meters are common. All of them are partially buried or covered with the dust of the dark mantle. In one locality, a crater of about 1 meter deep pentrated the relatively fine dark surface material and excavated small blocks. Other shallower craters||||Tape 86B/4|||||in this area did not fully penetrate the mantle. This fact, together with the abundance of small boulders on and near the surface, indicates that the dark mantle is relatively thin. A minor amount of dust noted upon landing suggested a thin layer of fine grain unconsolidated material. Footprints and LRV tracks left firm impressions in the fine grain material when darker material was kicked up from underneath. At the ALSEP site, the drill encountered harder material several times and definitely seem to reach harder material at about a 7-foot depth. The deep drill core apparently also bottomed in harder material. In the core, the material was noted to be cohesive, and it contained more fragments than did the surficial material. Predominant rock type between the LM and Steno Crater is medium grained, vesicular or nonvesicular basalts or gabbro. They contain about equal amounts of plagioclase and pyroxene along with less abundant opaque material. The guys took a total of - well, they took a lot of pictures. They had 229 color and 197 black-and-white during EVA-1. And they got 17 samples in addition to the deep drill core. Three were large, unbagged rocks, and the total, excluding the core, estimated to weigh about 13 kilograms so far, and they traveled about 3 kilometers in the Rover. As a summary conclusion, the observations made on the first EVA support the premission interpretation that at least the upper part of the subfloor materials consist of basaltic lava flow. The overlying dark mantle may be part of the regolith on subfloor material, but the possibility that it is an independent unit remains open and will be tested by observations on second and third EVAs. Both the dark mantle and upper sub floor units contain remarkably little foreign material between the ALSEP site and Steno with suggests comparatively young ages. Over.||CMP|Hey, that sounds like a good report there. They -sounds like they got a lot of stuff done and also getting a lot of good information out of it already.||||||Tape 86B/5||CC|Yes. I think that's a safe conclusion. They're going to get a lot more today.|05 09 55 52|CMP|Oh, you bet.|05 09 58 01|CC|Ron, for your information, the ALSEP seems to be working pretty well. The central station and all the experiments with the exception of one are working normally. The one that's giving them trouble is the LEAM, and the data on the LEAM doesn't seem to want to sync up properly. They're thinking that one over and maybe have something for them to try to get that to - to work right. Over.|05 09 58 33|CMP|Oh. Okay. Mighty fine.|05 10 11 45|CC|America, Houston.

It's a minus 0.0003 degrees per hour.||CMP|(Laughter) Hey, that's beautiful.||CC|That's got to be some kind of record.||CMP|Boy, I gues s.||CC|We may just cancel all further P52s.||CMP|(Laughter) Yes, they're kind of easy here in lunar orbit. All except that one that I didn't get done on time yesterday. By the time I got around to doing it, I was pointing right at the Moon. Roll and pitch. It was daylight, and I couldn't see any stars. Finally got to the right attitude, so that the PICAPAR would work.||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 87B/3|05 10 41 30|CMP|Well, Gordo. Looks like I'll lose you right in the middle of this zodiacal light sequencer.||CC|That's right. We aren't going to be able to be much help. I'll give you a little warning before T-start. But you're on your own after that, I guess.||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.|05 10 47 31|CC|Ron, you have about 30 seconds now until T-start.||CMP|Ah, hah. Okay. 28:03, we'll start the clock.||CC|That's affirm.|05 10 48 49|CC|Ron, it's about time - coming up on time to start the 90-second exposure.||CMP|Okay.|05 10 50 19|CC|Coming up on time to close the shutter now.||CMP|Okay.||CC|Okay, America. We're just about LOS. See you on the other side.|05 10 51 43|CMP|Okay, Gordo. Thank you much.|05 11 10 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 24|05 11 37 57|CMP|And out on the - on the sides of the wall, also, there's another fresh impact just south of ... I guess it's more west really.||CC|Hello, America.||CMP|Okay, Houston. America's here. The - the zodiacal light sequence worked real well. Oddly enough, I ended up right (laughter) on the right setting with the right times and everything. The only thing is on the 8-minute - on the 8-minute picture, for some reason, I didn't notice that the shutter shut as soon as I took it instead of 60 seconds later. So we just missed that picture altogether.||||Tape 87B/4||||CC|Okay, Ron. Understand.||CMP|But the time we worked out good. It was about 2 seconds after the l4:50 - sequence. Not 2 seconds - about 1 second after the 14:50 sequence. And the Sun came up.||CC|Okay.||CMP|It's going to be hard to - to determine any real relief around the vicinity of Saenger right in there, because it's right at the zero phase point now.||CC|Roger.|05 11 43 14|CC|Ron, here's some words on what we've been seeing in the sounder and the optical recorder when you get a free moment.||CMP|Okay. I'm just kind of looking out the window now, Gordo. Go ahead.||CC|Okay. According to our rather crude read-out on film remaining, it looks like we're using more film than we should be in the recorder, and -it's - if you add up the amount of film used according to that telemetry compared to some times when the RECORDER has been ON and also in STANDBY, it looks like there's a possibility they jive to show that we might be pulling film through the RECORDER in - while we're in STANDBY. This is unlikely because it takes a couple of failures that we don't think are really likely at all, but we're going to try to run a little test at 134:50, during that sequence of getting set up with the VHF sounder pass.||CC|It will just involve a couple of switch throwings by you to try to conclusively prove that this is or is not the case. Over.||CMP|Oh, okay. Mighty fine. Sure. When you get to it there, just holler out the switches because I'll be over at the panel at that time.||||||Tape 87B/5||CC|Okay.|05 ll 46 51|CMP|I kind of hope our telemetry is wrong.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 88B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 11 45 50|CMP|Microphone set now?|05 11 49 22|CMP|How'd you like to have the PAN CAMERA POWER, ON, here?||CC|Okay. We're ready.|05 11 49 35|CMP|Okay. MODE is to STANDBY; PAN CAMERA POWER is coming ON.||CMP|You know, Houston, just west of Condorcet and on the edge of - -||CC|Okay. We need the PAN CAMERA, OFF now, and then go - -|05 11 51 14|CMP|- - the hills down in there. Oh, okay. PAN CAMERA is OFF.||CC|Roger. Go ahead.||CMP|But you get the same vertical - you get the same vertical streaking that we do on the edge of Serenitatis , off in the Massif units.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Coming up at Picard now. Looking at it - a little bit from a distance, there's a darker albedo that goes about a half a crater in diameter from it. And then, on top of that darker albedo - It only goes out maybe a fourth of a crater diameter - there's a lighter type material - that seems to be covering it up. The lighter type material though only goes in a generally westerly - well, from the south around to the west side and then kind of from the northeast around to the northwest side, and it leaves the dark material draping down in the side of Picard on the east side of Picard.||CC|Roger.||||Tape 88B/2||||CMP|It looks like it's a - fairly easy to - When you|||go around the south to the west side, it has a light material on it. You can pretty well carry a light layer in the top portion of the wall all the way around to that - that part where it stops - where the light part stops. And then you come to a dark layer again - and then - as you continue around from the west to go on around to the north side. It's a little bit in shadow on the east side, so I can't tell for sure whether that light layer's in there or not. But starting on the south side, boing around to the west again, you can see a layer of dark - dark material, although it - there doesn't seem to be a change in the slope - in the slope or the inner wall of the crater.||CC|Okay.||CMP|And then just below - just below the dark layer, again a change In slope a little bit. It maintains that a slope throughout the - all the way down to the crater floor, where you get into the slump blocks. And then in the center of the crater, it looks like a maria-type film with -Yes, I'm about to lose sight of it again, but with something comparable to a central peak: in it. And I'll have to get the rest of that a little bit later on.||CC|Roger.||CMP|You know right west of - I think it's Yerkes or Yerkes or whatever it is - between there and Proclus, there's a real small crater I'm looking at with the binocs. And the reason it stands out is because it's a fresh - fresh crater and yet it's a dark - dark halo all the way around it.||CC|Roger.||CMP|And it's also dark down on the inside of it. I still don't have a feeling for the relative size of things. I'll try to get that one in the next - next pass around through here. But that's what I would call a small, maybe even In the - thousand-meter bracket. Probably somewhere in there.||||||Tape 88b/3||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|Am I suppose to charge battery A here somewhere?||CC|That's affirm when you get a chance. And also, you are due tc turn some switches on panel 230.|05 11 57 29|CMP|Okay. Let's see, BATTERY VENT VALVE is s+.ill on VENT, and we're not tied together. BA1- RELAY BUS BAT A is OUT. Okay; 32 volts. Go to BAT CHARGER BAT A. About 2-1/2 - 2 - 2-1/4 amps.||CC|Okay.||CMP|And 34 volts on the charge.||CC|Okay.||CMP|This work gets interesting. After that, I got to go to 230, huh?||CC|Right.|05 11 58 19|CMP|Okay; let's - You want to get that lunar sounder stuff, now? Sounder's STANDBY; RECORDER is ON. RADAR is ON. RECORDER is OFF. MODE vent to VHF.||CC|Okay; sounds good.|05 11 58 50|CMP|And all the VH - all the VH switch - VHF/AM switches are verified, OFF.||CC|Ron, I got one more update for the Flight Plan, unless something interesting at the window. There is no - no hurry on that update.||CMP|Okay; let me take another look at the landing site, and then I'll get it. Okay?||CC|Okay; fine.|05 11 59 57|CMP|Okay, the Sun's getting a little bit higher now. And as I look at the landing site and the albejo - differences In the color In there - the color in the Maraldi Gamma is the same as in the landing site itself. And, also, it looks like the type of material that we say is essentially covering the whole area - goes on out to and includes the annulus of Serenitatis.||||Tape 88B/4||||CC|Roger.||CMP|Let's see. Did I mention that - that it looks like - the flow out of Maraldi has gone on around it and down to, and almost encroaches on the Vitruvius A. But, it's breached out of the side of Maraldi. Gone around that depression and up to the side of Vitruvius A.||CC|Roger, Ron.||CMP|You still get that same bluish - bluish-type tint from the area in the landing site. At station number 2, on the landslide - it's going to be a pretty good - pretty good little depression there. The scarp itself - it looks like they had picked the least-slope portion to go up it. And, that's kind of between Lara - I think Lara's the one, right - the crater just to the west of the scarp.||CC|Roger. I haven't been on all your revs. You ever had any - anything you'd call a visual on the IM?|05 12 02 36|CMP|No, I really haven't looked that much, Gordo. See, my optics are always pointing up in the air; so I can't use the sextant. The binocs - I'm having a heck of a time holding them still enough to - to concentrate on anything very small.||CC|Roger,||CMP|Oh, when we're coming around the dark annulus , follow it around, by Menelaus and Tacquet, and then - it kind of changes - seems to change colors a little bit when we get up to the Sulpicius Gallus.||CC|Roger.||CMP|I guess the only thing you can say is that - the southern part there, in the Tacquet region, has a more of a bluish tint. And, then to me, this has more of a brownish tint to it when you get to the Sulpicius Gallus region.||||||Tape S8B/>||CC|Roger.||CMP|Hey, wait a minute. I'm just now passing Menelaus now. So, It changes color right at the - Tacquet and then - at about Tacquet and Menelaus. Sulpicius Gallus is just now coming up.||CMP|You know, I think Sun angle has got a heck of a lot to do with that, because this whole thing -in the Sulpicius Gallus region looks kind of brownish to me.|05 12 07 35|CC|Okay.||CMP|I'll have to check that when the Sun gets a little bit higher when I'm coming across there again.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Okay, Gordo. I guess I'd better get some work done here. (Laughter)||CC|Okay. I would like you to go through all those switches as shown on the Flight Plan. And, when you finish all of those with SM/AC power OFF, I have a couple more for you.||CMP|Okay. I forgot to turn the lights on in hare. I can't see in the dark.||CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA - Is that the right time? Let's see - 49? No, wait just a second on the mapping camera, there. It takes good terminator pictures, too, doesn't it?||CC|Ron, go ahead and turn the mapping camera off. Just a minute or 2 ago, it started acting up. We'll turn it off now and troubleshoot it later.|05 12 10 38|CMP|Okay. The MAPPING CAMERA is OFF right now. Eight, 30 seconds.||CMP|Okay, MAPPING CAMERA is STANDBY. IMAGE MOTION Is OFF.||||Tape 88B/6||||CMP|Okay, there we go - STANDBY. Now, IMAGE MOTION is OFF. We got a barberpole ... - a gray, okay. Now MAPPING CAMERA to OFF. LASER ALTIMETER to OFF. Okay, you want the RECORDER to ON, huh? All right. IR is going OFF. PAN CAMERA, SELF TEST is going OFF.|05 12 12 14|CC|Wait until sunset on the next one.||CMP|And, the o - oh, okay. I can really tell sunset because the - that EVA pole that sticks out here by window 5. Looks like it's lit up now the way the Sun's shining on it.||CC|Roger.||CMP|Hey, Gordo. How good is that VOX? Could you hear me chewing?||CC|No, I can't hear you chewing. Hear you talking fine.||CMP|Okay. That's good, then.||CMP|That has to be sunset.||CC|About the right time.|05 12 16 29|CMP|Okay, V is OFF. Now, I'm gonna close the IR COVER, barberpole, gray; UV COVER, barberpole and gray. Okay, turn the old SM/AC POWER, OFF.||CC|Okay, Ron. Now - now we want LUNAR - LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE switch to OPERATE.||CMP|Okay. Go to OPERATE -|05 12 17 15|CMP|Now.||CC|What we're doing this for is to get a readout of the film quantity.||CMP|Gh, I see.||CC|Okay, we got her. You go back to LUNAR SOUNDER OPERATE switch to STANDBY, now.||||||Tape 88B/7||CMP|Okay, LUNAR SOUNDER is in STANDBY.||CC|Okay, that completes that test. I have a couple more additions to the Flight Plan for - for 136: 35, is the first one.||CMP|Okay, I'm there.||CC|Okay, 136:35, add VERB 48 (11102) (01111).||CMP|Okay at 136: 35, VERB 48, (21102) and (01111).||CC|Okay, that first one is three ones - 02.||CMP|Okay, three ones - 02 and a zero, four ones.||CC|"Right. What we're doing here is making a 20-degree roll by keeping P20 going, to allow them to cal the VHF - I guess they had some unexpected noise on the VHF sounder and they want to - slip this in as another check on it. So, the next step is 136:44 and at that time put in VERB 22, NOUN 78 (plus 072.24), then VERB 58 ENTER. Then some words, ""When maneuver complete, wait 20 seconds."" Then, a VERB 22, NOUN 78 (plus 052.25). That's plus 052.25. And follow that with a VERB 58 ENTER. And, then one more line -you still with me?"||CMP|Yes, still with you. Got it.||CC|"Okay, at 136:47, write in ""VERB 48"" and we go back to (lllOl) and zero and four ones."||CMP|Okay. At 44, we - VERB 22, NOUN 78 [sic] - that changes to 72.24 degrees. And VERB 58. Okay, then we - we're going to stay at that attitude for 20 seconds. Then change it back to plus-X forward SIM bay attitude again. And as soon as we get back, we'll change our DAP back to two tenths of a degree per second.||CC|That's right and what this will do is stick the VHF antenna right straight down at nadir for a count.||CMP|Okay.||||Tape 88B/8||||CC|Hey, at your convenience, we need AUTO and HIGH GAIN.|05 12 22 34|CMP|You have AUTO.||CMP|Pretty convenient when you're laying in the center couch. (Laughter)||CMP|(Humming)||CC|Ron, I got the morning news, if you're interested and I can watch the clock there for that DATA SYSTEM ON time. Or OFF time, rather.||CMP|Okay, sure. Go ahead.||CC|Okay. - -||CMP|... setting up the camera.||CC|Front pages around the country; they're headlining last night's EVA, as you might expect, with photographs taken from TV monitors showing Ceman and Schmitt doing their tasks. And by the way, their TV camera is spectacularly clear and sharp. It's almost like a regular studio TV. In other news, South Vietnam's President Thieu is - -|05 12 25 47|CMP|Outstanding.||CC|-- is suggesting that all prisoners of war be released before Christmas. He's also asked that all Vietnamese parties be included in peace negotiations. South Vietnam and the Viet Cong are not directly represented in the secret talks now underway in Paris,||||||Tape 88B/9|||yesterday, that he wants to extend wage price control beyond the scheduled April 30 expiration. He also plans to freeze new hiring, promotions, and pay increases for executives of the Federal Government. I guess that doesn't include us. The Republican National Committee has a - -|05 12 26 59|CMP|(Laughter) I don't think it does either.||CC|- - a new chairman - George Bush of Houston, who is now ambassador to the United Nations. He will continue his UN post through the present session of the General Assembly. Both national political parties are now headed by Texans. I simply mention to you, |05 12 27 4l|CMP|(Laughter) Outstanding.||CC|Joe Namath - I think you might have heard the football score last night - the Oakland Raiders got to Namath and the Jets in a - in the fourth-quarter and beat them 24 to l6. Namath passed for more than 400 yards, but only scored one touchdown. And Houston weather, we've had two kinds of weather since you've left: it's been either cold and rainy, or chilly and rainy. And, it's foggy and drizzly here again today and temperatures are expected to rise to the mid 40's and go down to a low of 32 tonight. There you have it.||CMP|Gee, whiz. I thank you.||CC|Any time. You need to get to the DATA SYSTEM switch. And turn on the sounder at - in about a minute.||CMP|Okay.||||Tape 88B/10|||05 12 29 48|CMP|Okay.

Most likely, we think it's just an instrumentation erroneous indication. And so, -we're going to continue with the normal schedule of activities on the mapping camera, except, of course, for the deploy and retraction.||CMP|Uh-huh. Okay. Well, hey, that - let's hope that's what it is then.||CC|Roger.|05 13 49 22|CMP|I'd like to change that instruct to frame 55 instead of 54. I just took a picture of the crater on the - well, I guess southwest of Crisium.||CC|Okay, Ron - -||CMP|- - ... different. It's got a light-color -light-colored dike or something through the central peak in the bottom of the small crater.

That's what everybody keeps saying.|05 14 25 57|CC|Roger. I just drove in, and it's kind of a sleety rain. It feels like it might snow at any moment, although It's really not that cold.

That's good to hear. Sounds like we're getting kind of low on VHBW film though is what you're saying, huh?||CC|On that particular magazine; yes, Ron. That's the problem, I think. Looking at the total thing is more - is which magazine has got what on it.||CMP|Oh, okay.|05 14 45 52|CC|And we'll see you at 01:38:15 when you'll be just about eating. So give us a call if you want anything. We'll be listening.||CMP|Okay. I'll be on the loop. Oh - Hey, one thing. Can you check on mag - what do I have on the Nikon now, XX, I guess? It seems to me like - we just need that for another zodiacal light thing.||CC|Okay. We got FA0 working on that.||CMP|... know is, in other words, are there two or three frames available? Do we have two or three frames available on that one?||CC|Okay. Let me check on it, Ron?||CMP|Okay.|05 14 46 44|CMP|I want to take a red and a blue picture of the landing site sometime.||CC|It's going to take a little bit of chasing on that, Ron. We may not have the word before you go LOS, but we'll have it definitely when you come up AOS.||CMP|Oh, okay. Yes, don't - No - no problem. I won't use it until we get to the landing site anyhow.|05 14 47 24|CC|Okay, Ron. There are 18 spares on X-ray X-ray that you could use.|05 14 47 31|CMP|Oh, okay . Good.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 90A/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 14 15 05|CC|(Music: Rite of the Valkyrie by Wagner)|05 14 16 39|CC|Good morning, Challenger.||LMP-LM|Sounded like Parker has the duty. Both monumental and epic.||CC|Jack, that's supposed to take you back to Cal Tech final's week.||LMP-LM|(Humming)||LMP-LM|How's everything look, Gordy?||CC|Couldn't look better. How's it look to you?||LMP-LM|Well, it's nice to have rested some.||CC|Roger. I'm sure of that.||LMP-LM|How do our consumables look today?||CC|They look good, as expected. Right on.||LMP-LM|Be through in a jiffy.||LMP-LM|Stow your sleep restraint up there. I mean, your -hammock. Either way. I'll - I'll just stuff my -I'll stuff all mine in this compartment here, if you'll just get yours in there. Otherwise, we can rearrange it. See how it looks first.||LMP-M|Gordy, you guys held comm pretty well last night, I only remember one - one break.||CC|Roger, J ack.||CC|Take you off biomed for a minute.|05 14 24 28|LMP-LM|We have ...||LMP-LM|Well, how about it, Gordy? Are we STAY or NO STAY for EVA-2 prep?||||Tape 90A/2||||CC|It's STAY. Never any doubt.||LMP-LM|Thank you, sir.||CC|Have any medication?||CDR-LM|My report to ...||LMP-LM|Okay, Gordy. Status report is excellent. No medication for either one of us. CDR slept 6 hours pretty good; I slept 6 hours intermittent, but generally good.||CC|Okay, Jack.||LMP-LM|And we've eaten well, I think. The food's a little bit confused since we had our little - minor explosion in the cabin, but - I think you can just say it's good. We've had a lot to drink, a lot of juices. We ate the frankfurters. We're sharing a lot of the stuff because it's not symmetrically packed. If you want more details, it will take time.||LMP-LM|Huh? No.||LMP-LM|And, Gordy, we did not eat the corn chowder.||CC|Okay. Roger. You did not eat the corn chowder, but most everything else on the menu. Is that r ight ?||LMP-LM|Yes, we got just about everything else. We got into - maybe mixed up two meals, but essentially -meal B and C for yesterday were eaten, except for the corn chowder.||CC|Okay, Jack. We copy. We're wondering if you could come up with a quantitative estimate on the water you've each drunk - drunk and also your PRD readings.||LMP-LM|Stand by, Gordy. That may be difficult. Yes, we'll get the PRD a little bit later when we start suiting up.||||||Tape 90A/3||CC|Yes; okay. That'll be fine. My mistake.||CDR-LM|Hey, Gordy, on this water. We saturated ourselves before we went out. I finished my drink bag out in the suit on the surface. Jack finished about better than three-quarters of his. We've had water and tea and then the juice, and we have been drinking water constantly - post-EVA. And to give you a quantity is almost impossible.||CC|Okay; that's fine.||CDR-LM|If the water is down, it's probably because we've been drinking it. And I'm ready for your lift-off pad data.|05 l4 29 30|CC|Okay. For rev 26, lift-off time is 138:40:15; 27 is 140:38:49; 142:37:22; 144:35:55; 11*6:34:29; 148:33:03. And the last one, rev 32, is 150:31:37 Go ahead.||CDR-LM|Okay; rev 26. Is that the first one, Gordy?||CC|That's affirm.||CDR-LM|Okay. Rev 26 is 138:40:15; 140:38:49; 142:37:22; 144:35:55; 146:34:29; 148:33:03; 150:31:37- And what's our present rev?||CC|Okay, I'll have to check that myself. We're on rev 25- He's about three-quarters of the way across the front side. Coming up back side will start 26.||CDR-LM|Okeydoke.||CC|And, for your information, he's running the VHF SOUNDER, and it's working fine.||CDR-LM|That's good to hear. By the way, good morning, Gordy.||CC|Good morning, commander.||CDR-LM|How does America itself look?||||Tape 90A/4||||CC|Just as good as ever. I added on the consumables. No problem on the spacecraft systems. Only minor funnies in the SIM bay, but even it is almost 100 percent.||CDR-LM|Okay. And I guess from - I didn't hear your comment, but I guess Challenger is the same way.||CC|That's affirm. That's the way it looks here, anyway.|05 14 33 15|CC|Challenger, Houston. We've been working while you've been sleeping on a fix for the missing fender. John Young has been over working it out in the suit with the mockup Rover, and we have about probably 5 to 10 minutes worth of words. And how do you want to go about that? Whenever you have that much time to listen - It'll be mostly listening on your part - let us know.||CDR-LM|Okay, Gordy. Will do.||LMP-LM|No. Well, I did but I covered it.||LMP-LM||05 14 35 33|LMP-LM|Gordy, you've implied that we may be a little behind on water. Is that correct?||CC|No. That1s - that's not the problem, Jack. I think our concern was more that you - that you were taking enough - enough onboard internally.||LMP-LM|Our water,||CC|ThatT s right, That you were drinking enough. That's what ve were worried about.||LMP-LM|Okay; we'll keep pushing it.||LMP-LM|Huh?||CDR-LM|Oh, a ...||LMP-LM|And cold scrambled eggs.||CDR-LM|Gordy, we're going to start to eat here. Why don't you talk to us about that fender?||||||Tape 90A/5||CC|Okay; let me round up - John Young. He stepped out - for a second. We'll have him here in a minute. Might as well let the resident expert on fenders talk.||CC|Okay; I'11 now turn the microphone over to Captain Young.||MCC|Hey, Geno. This is John. We spent - -||CDR-LM|Hello, John. How you doing?|05 14 40 11|MCC|Oh, just fine. You guys are doing a superb job; really beautiful. Hey, we spent some time on this - fender problem and worked out a pretty simple-minded procedure, which involves essentially taking four of those chronopaque pages out of your lunar surface map, ones which are not going to be used for discussing the site, taping them together with gray - gray tape so that you end up with a piece of paper about 15 inches by 10-1/2 inches, and then using the AOT lamp clamp, preposition them full opened, and taking them out, and taking that piece of paper out, laying it on top of the fender guide rails and - and clamping the edges of it with the AOT lamp clamps. It's simple and straightforward, and the beauty of it is you're only spending about 2 minutes in the clamping operation, and it could save you up to about 12 dusting, I think maybe. What do you think?||CDR-LM|Yes, John. I - I - I think we ought to try something because you told me, but I - I guess you can't appreciate it until you see it happen yourself. That - that dust without that - that fender is just almost unacceptable. It - this sounds pretty good. How do you want those things taped together?||MCC|You just take four pages and allow - Well, I've got the detailed procedures here, if you're ready to copy. Over,||||Tape 90A/6||||CDR-LM|Well, no. I'm not ready to copy yet, but what do you do? Tape the four squares into a bigger square about l6 by 20.||MCC|Yes. Allow about an inch of overlap, and tape both sides of them.||CDR-LM|Okay.||MCC|And then you get the AOT clamps off the utility lights and open the clamp jaws to max. And you stow the clamps, and you roll up the paper - roll up the - roll up your fender shortwise and put a gray tab over that and stow it in the ETB. You got both the clamps and the paper fender in the ETB. And then when you get out to the Rover, you lay the edge of your fender over the inboard guide rail and clamp it, and then you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard rail and clamp it. And the only thing you're - really have to worry about is making sure that the inboard clamp is right over the shock strut so that you don't get any interference with the LRV structure when you turn the wheel.||CDR-LM|Yes, that's the type of thing I was going to ask about, some of those subtle points. There - there really should be quite aways - Well, I'll look at it - but almost vertical over the hub. Right?||MCC|Yes, on the inboard one. On the inboard one. On the outboard one, if you put it a little further back aft on the wheel, it - it allows you to - it allows you to give your paper fender a little more rigidity.|05 14 44 10|CDR-LM|And you just say lay them over the guide rails, so the clamps - put the clamps - so the clamps are also over the guide rails. They're not trying -align that - the makeshift fender in the guide rails itself, huh?||MCC|No, it - Just clamp the thing right to the rails. Just allow a little overlap, and clamp that rascal right down. And I know you can tighten those clamps down so good it'll never get loose. I know - I know you can do it if I can do it.||||||Tape 90A/7||CDR-LM|Okay, John. I think I know what you're talking about, and I'd sure like to give it a stab. The only hooker is I hope that tape holds the fenders together well enough - -||MCC|Yes, they - -||CDR-LM|#NAME?||MCC|Roger. One of the things - when you're taping the - the pages together that you want to be careful of is that you - is that you make sure and get the air bubbles out so when you get in a vacuum, it doesn't open up by itself. And maybe you can put an X across there to - to make sure that you - if you get any separation - that's it's still held together pretty good. We think the tape will work - -||CDR-LM|Okay.||MCC|- - think the tape will work because back about in 13, we were using it just sort of incidentally in the thermal vacuum chamber, and it worked okay there for some reason.||CDR-LM|It would seem to stick on the surface okay if I could find a dust-free spot when I put that other fender on earlier.||MCC|Yes, I agreed.||CDR-LM|As far as - as far as how much of the new fender to overlap on the present fender, just make it about symmetrical with the other side, and that probably ought to give me plenty of overlap, huh?||MCC|Well, if you - are you talking about over the dovetail part of it, or are you talking about off the aft end of the - of the vehicle?||CDR-LM|I'm talking about - about the present fender that's on there, the aft end of that fender. About how much overlap do you want with this makeshift fender? Just give me an idea. I think I could figure out when I get there, but I'd rather have your feelings before I do.||||Tape 90A/8||||MCC|We think if you get it out about 4 inches past that fender - You understand what this looks like when you get it put on the fender. It just looks like sort of a roll, and you end up with a sort of a straight fender right at the back end of the -of the - of the Rover - a sort of a straight -about half a pipe straight out there. And, if you get it out 4 or 5 inches, that will keep the dust from coming back over the vehicle.||CDR-LM:|Yes, that would be about where I want it. That would be about 4 or 5 inches.||MCC|Yes, it's just sort of like a - a horizontal fender, like on a - a old automobile.||LMP-LM|I thought I understood what he was talking about.||MCC|Say again, Geno.||LMP-LM|Hey, John. This is Jack. Did you say pipe there a minute ago? P-i-p-e?|05 l4 47 56|MCC|Yes, but it doesn't roll up into a circle; it's sort of a - a hemisphere. I mean it's half of one.|||END OF TAPE||||||Tape 90B/1||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION|05 15 07 XX||BEGIN LUNAR REV 26|05 15 36 33|CMP|Houston, America.||CC|Hello, America.

Go ahead - -||CMP|Just at the last step of the - last step of the solar corona thing which says go back to CMC AUTO - which wouldn't have been too bad, except as soon as you get a waste water dump, it really torques it around, I guess. And, somewhere - you ought to be able to check it back on the tape -at about 137:50 - between 50 and probably - no, between 55 and 58, somewhere in there, I got the GIMBAL LOCK light and all those good deal things; and got her under control. Took her back. And we got back to SIM bay attitude at 137:59:20. In the meantime, while I was doing all that, looked like my waste water dropped down kind of low, too. How much are you reading down there?|05 15 38 25|CC|Okay. Stand by on that, Ron.||CC|We're reading 0.16 percent and 0.9 pound - 1.6 percent and 0.9 pounds, Ron.||CMP|I didn't quite make it to zero, did I?||CC|Ron, that's affirm.||CMP|Okay. Caught that in time, anyway.||||Tape 90B/2||||CC|Hey, Ron, just a question, here. Pick up where you were briefing us there. Did you go to CMC AUTO after the solar corona, or did you get the GIMBAL LOCK light prior to going to AUTO.|05 15 40 04|CMP|(Laughter) I got it prior to going to AUTO. I forgot to go to AUTO after the solar corona thing.||CC|Okay. We've got you.||CMP|The full cell purge and the waste water dump.

With the red-blue filtered exposure you want it at F/ll, 1/125, one frame each filter; F/ll, 1/250; one frame each filter. With no filter, expose at F/ll, 1/1000. And if you want to use the polarizing filter, expose at F/ll, 1/500 of a second.|05 15 45 25|CMP|Okay. Looks like we'll bracket it, there: F/ll, 1/125, one frame on each filter; and F/ll at 1/250, one frame on each filter; and without a filter, one -F/ll at 1/1000; and polarizing F/ll at 1/500.||CC|"Okay.

So we need the GET time when we take the picture.||CC|That's - that's affirm - with the polarizer.||CMP|... Yes. Yes, with the polarizer. Right.||CC|And there's another note here.

Stand by 1, though.||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|Hey, you know, after thinking and looking at the map last night, and recalling what I saw during landing and where I was planning on putting it down and everything, I still think, to the best of my knowledge, that we are about 1 or 2 o'clock, and I'll increase up to about 200 meters or so west and slightly north of Poppy.||||Tape 91A/2||||CC|Okay, Geno.||CDR-LM|... ahead of you ...|05 14 50 56|CDR-LM|Hey, Gordie, the thing that fooled me yesterday is this depression out at - out at 9 o'clock here, which I - is greatly undersized for Trident, really isn't Trident, and I said yesterday, I didn't think how we could be that close. Well, we really aren't Trident is way out there, and I'll still hold to my 200 meters at 1 to 2 o'clock of Poppy.||CC|Okay. We're thinking you might have, on the way to the geology stops, driven between a couple of the Trident craters then.||CDR-LM|Yes, we may have coming back- I think I went all the way around to the east of the last one going out, though.||CC|Okay.||CDR-LM|If you had asked me at 3- or 4000 feet where we were going to land, I could have told you exactly. But, once you decide where it's going to be, then you decide where in that where it's going to be if you forget everything else around you.||CC|Roger.||CDR-LM|Besides, Gordy, when you land on a boat, all you're worried about is that the boat's there. You let the captain worry about where it is.||CC|Roger.|05 15 54 51|CDR-LM|Gordy, while we're eating, have you got a short synopsis of the news?||CC|Yes. Sure do. Stand by 1.

I might add that the TV camera is really spectacular. It couldn't have been a clearer or more beautiful picture, both for fidelity and color. In other news, South Vietnam's President Thieu has suggested that all prisoners of war be released before Christmas. He has also asked that all Vietnamese parties be included in peace negotiations. South Vietnam and the Viet Cong are now not directly represented in the secret talks now under way in Paris. Meanwhile, Kissinger met for more than 4 hours yesterday with Hanoi representative Le Due Tho. The two negotiators are expected to meet again this afternoon. The former President, Harry Truman, is still resting quietly, although his condition remains serious according to his doctors. American poet Mark van Doren died at the age of 78- He was a professor of literature at Columbia and a winner of the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for his poetry. President Nixon announced yesterday that he wants to extend price controls beyond the scheduled April 30 expiration date. He also plans to freeze new hiring, promotions, and pay increases for executives of the Federal Government, which doesn't affect us, I guess. The Republican National Committee has a new chairman.||CDR-LM|How about me?||CC|George Bush of Houston, who is Ambassador to the United Nations. He will continue his UN post through the present session of the General Assembly. Both national political parties are now headed by Texans. As you recall, Robert Strauss of Dallas became Chairman of the Democratic National Committee last Saturday. And Jack, I'm sorry to say that you've been replaced. The Nimbus 5 weather satellite is now operating after its launch from Vandenberg early Monday morning.||LMP-LM|Can it talk?||||Tape 91A/4||||CC|Joe Namath tried mightily to lead the Jets to the play-offs, but the Oakland Raiders grounded the Jets in the fourth quarter, 2k to 16. I think you have already heard that score. Namath passed some more than 400 yards, but he was only able -New York only scored one touchdown. And the last item concerns the Houston weather, which is been -there's been two kinds of weather since you all left us: That's cold and light rain and cold and heavy rain, and it's still doing it. Fog and drizzly rain are here now, and we're only supposed to get up to the mid-40!s and probably down to 32 tonight. Over.||LMP-LM|Holy Smoly. That doesn't sound too good on the weather. I'm going to take a look, right here up the overhead window.|05 14 59 55|LMP-LM|Gordy, you're right. There's a band of clouds that comes right up the coast of Mexico. Looks like it comes ... Old Mexico and then gets very dense as it comes up into the Texas area and southeastern part of the United States with a - with a counterclockwise rotation which gets very dense down over the Atlantic, I believe, off the east coast - southern east coastal states and from about, oh, I'm guessing, maybe the center of Texas straight north, straight east. It looks like the whole country's cloudy.||CC|Roger.||LMP-LM|Baja looks nice; west coast of Mexico looks nice.||CC|Roger.|05 15 00 54|LMP-LM|At Taurus Littrow, the weather's great.|05 15 04 05|LMP-LM|Hey, Houston; Challenger.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-LM|Roger, Gordy. How's the ALSEP doing and in that light I hope you people will take as close a look as you can at the signal strength and its variation and see if you get some idea whether, when I||||||Tape 91A/5|||go after the neutron flux tomorrow, if I ought to work on that antenna alignment again. I'm still a little bit concerned about it.||CC|Okay, Jack. We'll consider that although they've been getting good performance out of the central station, as I understand, and a couple of problems with the experiments. One was the LEAM data isn't syncing up like it should. I'll have to get a further, more complete story on that. And we're thinking that's - -||LMP-LM|I told you „||CC|„ mostly on ground software problem. The other one is the LSG isn't leveling up properly, and we'll cover this further in the planning briefing for the EVA here, but we're probably going to let you off - I mean have Geno let Jack off at the Rover - I mean at the ALSEP. Let him off the Rover at the ALSEP and take another look at the leveling on the LSG. That'll be at the end of the EVA.||LMP-LM|Roger. I may just run out there and let Gene pick me up after we - after I turn - well - while he fixes the fender maybe - We'll work that out, Gordy. I'm joking, but maybe I could go kick the LEAM - that might help it.||CC|Let's make sure we've got all our problems solved down here before you do that.||LMP-LM|Okay, hey, Family Mountain, the northeast facing slopes, although lower has boulders and outcrops. I mean, below the outcrop. It has boulders from local block concentrations. Looks very much like the South Massif does.||CC|Roger||CDR-LM|... the old sinuses ...||CDR-LM|I've about had it, I think.||LMP-LM|.,. chocolates?||||Tape 91A/6||||CDR-LM|Huh? No, I've had two.||LMP-LM|Oh. ...|05 15 09 50|LMP-LM|Hey, Gordo, we're still eating, but let me give you a few observations. That outcrop I talked about that was way at the top of the South Massif at the break in slope - at the very top of the break in slope - almost looks - it's hard to tell that it's inplace outcrop up there. It's hard to convince myself that it is. Looks like there's some very large and many, many small fragments of large - like 3- and 4-meter rocks up there and a lot of smaller fragments. I've seen that type of of thing In a number of places over the South Massif. However, I - do see - they also, they all seem to be sitting on top of the South Massif surface, but 1 do see one other area that it looks like there is a - it is protruding from within some sort of mantle on the South Massif. So conceivably some of that could be a place [?] An additional impression I got is - is that at least with the monocular, that those fragments -those boulders look much more angular than what we've seen here. And, for the most part, they appear to be - if covered at all - very little by any mantle except the one I just mentioned.||CC|Okay. Copy that.||LMP-LM|And, Gordy, through the monocular, in contrast to the tan gray of the South Massif, those large blocks up there look blue - very distinctly blue-gray. Not unlike Gene mentioned yesterday, anorthosite - anorthosites look in certain terrestrial environments.||CC|Roger, Jack.||CDR-LM|And, Gordy, now that I get my - my three-dimensional eyeballs working, I can look up on the scarp - out to 9 and 10 o'clock. It's practically the same color as the South Massif. It just looks to be very undulating. I see no outcrop evidenced from here in the scarp. I think I can just about see where Hole-in-the-Wall is, but it's so subtle that||||||Tape 91A/7|||I can't really tell you much about it. And the local terrain, which I think is the southern rim of Camelot, just about blanks out where Hole-in-the-Wall should be - just about covers it up. But what I can see in a small little saddle to our local horizon here in front of us - I can see out there just about - oh, I'd say a 100 meters or so to the south of Hole-in-the-Wall and it just looks like a subtle undulating slope. We can't really tell too much the steepness from here.||CC|Okay, Geno, we're - Stand by 1.||CC|Okay. I had something for you, but we just decided to cancel the call. Although, when you do get out the prep and post card, I have one write in for you so just holler when you're - when it's handy.|05 15 13 25|CDR-LM|Okay.||CDR-LM|We're wrapping up our eating and drinking, here now, Gordy. We'll be ready to go in a minute.||CC|Okay.|05 15 17 20|LMP-LM|Gordy, Challenger. Could you ask somebody there in the FAO console to, - where the hiking kit is -is stowed?||CC|Okay. Will do.|05 15 20 00|CC|Jack, take a look on the right-hand side stowage compartment there, on the forward lower corner under the LEC kit compartment.||LMP-LM|Gordy, you broke - broke up with the changeover or something. Say again.||CC|Okay, Jack. You're right. I got caught right in the middle of a site handover. Look on the right-hand side stowage compartment, the forward lower corner, under the LEC kit compartment.||LMP-LM|Fantastic. You picked the one place I'd never look.||||Tape 91A/8|||05 15 25 57|LMP-LM|Houston, Challenger.||CC|Go ahead.||LMP-LM|One quick thought about the gravimeter. And. I'm sure it's been mentioned, but I'll say it. During the CF squared we asked about that bundle of wires that has contact with the gimbal - and when I deployed it, that bundle was - it still had contact with the gimbal and everybody at the CF squared said that was okay. But, you might think about it. I don't know what I could do to help if that is the problem. But that might be causing the problem here that it wouldn't cause on Earth.||CC|Okay, Jack. I'll make sure the experts hear that.||CDR-LM|Gordie, everthing okay at home today?||CC|Yes, everything is fine here.||CDR-LM|Well, thank you.||CC|I'm not sure I copy your question precisely. Haven't talked to - to your home today, at all.||CDR-LM|Okay. Don't - don't worry about it. I just thought you might have heard.||CDR-LM|Well, if you hear, Gordie, just tell them they're missed.||CC|Okay; I'll sure do that.||LMP-LM|Gordie, has anybody heard from Tucson recently?||CC|Check on that, Jack. Just a minute.||LMP-LM|And, Gordie, if you have any updates to the EVA.-2 checklist, give me a yell.||CC|Okay. The update I do have - I think the EVA checklist changes, we'll just call you, real time. But, I do have one for the prep card.||LMP-LM|Go ahead.||||||Tape 91A/9|05 15 31 07|CC|Okay. On the front side there, middle column, lower half at 138:^5 OPS CONNECT, half-way dovn, it says install PURGE valve in PGA, red to red. Mark that LMP serial number 211; CDR, 208. This is to maximize the OPS operation, should you have to use it.||LMP-IM|Okay. Give me the numbers again, please.||CC|LMP, 211; CDR, 208.||LMP-LM|I take it those are serial numbers.||CC|That's right, the serial numbers on the purge valve.|05 15 33 07|CC|Okay, Challenger. This is Houston. Would you like to have a little update on the EVA plans?||LMP-LM|Do you want me to take notes?||CC|No, I don't think there are essentially any notes required. I'll make a few real-time callups to you; but, I don't think there's anything you really have to write down.||LMP-LM|Okay, Bob, I didn't realize that things were getting a little hectic yesterday. But, if we end up making any changes where I don't need to get a charge in my hands - that's an awfully good thing to call, because not only does it tire your heart - your hands out holding it, but it means you don't get as many pictures or Rover samples or anything else.|05 15 33 54|CC|Roger. You guys are just ahead of us there. We were trying to get that up to you. Okay. So, I don't think there is anything here that really needs to be written down. I'll go through with you first, and we can talk about details and writing in, if you want to on any of them. But, I don't think there Is anything that really needs to be written in. The EVA - it is going to be essentially nominal, with two minor exceptions. One is the - we've allowed about 5 minutes extra at the LK before leaving for the Rover fender fix; and, John, we'll be talking to you about that in a minute. And the second tig change, is that we're also extend - allowing 5 more minutes at the end||||Tape 91A/10|||||of the EVA so that we can have extra time for dusting. And I suspect that if the Rover fender fix works and we aren't getting as dirty as we did last night, then we may gain back that 5 minutes. We're also allowed - well, what we've done is we've taken the time here out of some of the tasks at station 3 and station 4. And along with the fact that we think you're a little bit farther east than planned - and we're allowing 4 minutes additional driving time. But again, that's all real time, and. if we're doing well on time, we can reinstitute all those tasks and get rid of the 5 minutes that we are allowing here, there, or elsewhere. So that's just sort of to keep in your thinking.|05 15 35 2k|CC|There is a possibility that we'll have some additional overhead at each stop, depending on what the Rover battery temperatures are when you get out this morning. If the Rover - if they're high again, then we'll have to probably park at least on some of the stops, if not all - with the up-Sun heading and dusting the battery covers and then opening them to let them cocl. But, again, that will depend upon what we find on the Rover batteries when we get out this morning.|05 15 35 53|CC|The variations that we found on the surface of the South Massif indicating a possibility of layering - I guess you saw those mostly with the monocular and the observation of boulder tracks and the size of the Massif emphasizes the importance of sampling boulders that can be traced to sources at various elevations of the Massif. And I guess we should say that's hopefully. And we'll just have to see what happens when we get down to station 2 on that. But, if we see boulders with tracks. I'm sure you guys remember that they obviously will have a higher priority. Since we didn't get to Emory, and since we didn't really get to the rim of Steno itself, the question of sampling of the actual subfloor is still somewhat ambiguous although there is a large consensus opinion that says that we sampled the subfloor when we sampled that intermediate Gabbro that we sampled yesterday at both the ALSEP and station 1. The - here is a possible alternative conclusion which says that the subfloor||||||Tape 91A/11|||has not been sampled, but that these blocks that we sampled and the surface are both parts of a later flow. And, in that line, we're still looking for specific observations which will help us distinguish between whether or not the dark mantle is a - whether the dark mantle is a separate unit from the intermediate gabbro that we're seeing or, whether it's the - Stand by.|05 15 37 30|CC|Okay. Whether or not the dark mantle is an entirely separate unit from the intermediate gabbro you were sampling yesterday or whether it just represents the top of very well churned up layer of a flow that was later than the subfloor - if you see what I'm saying there. All this says is that we're very interested, of course now - -||CDR-LM|Roger, Bob.||CC|- All this says that, we're very much more interested in station 5, as you might expect, than we were before. And I guess, for this reason, we'll be trying to keep the time line a little tighter than usual to guarantee that we've got some time left over a||||Tape 91A/12|||05 15 39 l4|CC|Okay. To summarize that again, reading - I guess I got ahead of myself here in the little deal they wrote up. At the present time we have two working hypotheses for the dark mantle, the gabbro - and the gabbro relationships to each other. One: the crystalline rocks that we found in the gabbro are an upper unit of the subfloor with their dark mantle cover unrelated to them in time. Key observations that they suggest here, are stratigraphy at Camelot, station 55 and other steep craters. Especially, perhaps, the trench and sheltered spots which are unguarded - ungardened, as in plowed - for an older regolith underneath the dark mantle, if such a thing could be found. We don't think we found that yesterday. Or, look at the superposition relations between dark mantles and boulders or, the mantles -instances of the mantle on the boulders or, inversely, of small boulders on the mantle.|05 15 40 06|CC|The second working hypothesis is that - is that the dark mantle is regolith derived from a vitreous, vesicular, flow top of the crystalline rock flow beneath. And, it again goes to say that perhaps the re - gabbro that we sampled yesterday was indeed the late flow; and what the regolith was, was derived from the vitreous , vesicular flow top} as it were. Again, many of the same observations are called for. In particular, they'd be interested then in looking at the coarser fines as they define as from a millimeter to 20 millimeters, for some sort of transitional lithologies and textures. In other words, what do the small walnut-size rocks look like, if you can in hand specimens? If I can get more specific in terms of EVA mechanics, let me say that we'll call out in real time the deletion of the tasks at stations 3 and 4, if they become necessary. And what we're planning on doing is, deleting the trench in the base of the scarp at station 3, and also, deleting the radial sample of the - on Shorty at station 4. That's the provision that we're planning on. And depending on how the time is going, we'll call that out real time. We also have - The experiments remain pretty much the same. We'll deploy the charges at the same locations as we're planning in the checklist at the present time. We also don't - for your||||||Tape 91A/13|||"planning further ahead, we don't anticipate any significant changes in EVA 3- The charge number 5, which we were going to deploy at Emory, will not -but didn't, will not be deployed during EVA 2, but we'll deploy it on EVA 3 out at station 10. And, what we're going to do there, is when you take the 8 pounder and put it between the seats, we'll then have the 3 pounder left over, and we'd like to put that on one of the footpads In the Sun - that1s probably either the minus-Z or minus-Y footpad. And, we'll leave it there in the Sun until the start of EVA 3, in which case we'll put in the Rover underneath the LMP's seat. And, thermally, that looks okay. There is a probability that we're going to play the ""return to the ALSEP game,"" and we're going to do this for a couple of reasons. One, we're going to go back and look at getting some more ALSEP photos. I guess Gordy says you've got that. And, that will probably be at the end of EVA - in fact, it will certainly be, if it happens, at the end of EVA 3 when you go back to get the neutron flux probe. I might also say with regard to EVA 3 that, obviously, we're more interested in station 10 than we were before. Another ""return to the ALSEP"" goodie that we're looking at - if we have the consumables today when you get back from finishing station 5 - is that the lunar surface gravimeter has been unable to level Itself over the night, and they sent some, you know, some thousand commands trying to get it straightened out, and they say it looks as though it's not level. And, so, we'd like Jack to go back with his practiced hand-on-bubble levels and recheck that at the end of - after station 5 today, if there's sufficient consumables. And, we've planned for Gene to just let Jack off and let him walk back to the LM, after he gets off and looks at that. And, that's about - everything we have. As I say, in summary, that the big changes are going to be extra time at the beginning, taking care of the fender extension, and the probability of extra time at the end. Although we'll have to see how well the fender works and how things go. The probability of extra time at the end to allow for dusting and the time spent on those particular activities we'll probably end up taken out of the task at station 3 and station 4. Over. Comments?"||||Tape 91A/14|||05 15 44 12|LMP-LM|Okay, Bob. We copy all that. Obviously, you're going to have to catch us in real time on some of the details there - on the charges and the task deletion. One question, did you say we were going to delete the trench at station 3?||CC|Roger. The trench at the base of the Scarp, in other words, some of the stuff that you would be doing while Gene was taking the double core.||LMP-LM|What do you gain by that?||CC|Well. No comment on that, Jack.||LMP-LM|If you haven't deleted Gene's tasks, then what am I supposed to do?||CC|You're supposed to help Gene, I guess.||LMP-LM|Well, but that's not the way we worked it, Bob. Let's play that one in real time.|05 15 45 05|CC|Roger. That's why I said there's no point in marking up the checklist on that, Jack. Let me hit you with one more thing concerning the battery temps. An initial reaction down here is that the battery temps were high on deployment because of particularly unfavorable heat soaking on the way out. And the Marshall people are hopeful that they'll be back to normal this morning. However, we're obviously anxious, as I'm sure you are, to get an early reading on the battery temp - that's number 1. And number 2, just for the off chance that the meter's not working, I think we've pretty much discounted that, because of the way the meter worked yesterday. But, on the off chance that the meter's not working, you might just lean over and see if the meter is reading zero before you punch in the circuit breakers , because that would give us at least a partial confirmation in that direction, that there's not something wrong with the offset. If they're reading - sitting there reading 30 to 40 degrees, then that probably says something about the offset. And, beyond th at - -||SC-LM|||||||Tape 91A/15||CC|Go ahead.||CDR-LM|I'll look at that, Bob, what the meter has indicated in terms of a temperature change. I'll look and see if there's a bias on them at all.||CC|Roger. We - we again also think that that's probably not too likely.|05 15 46 26|LMP-LM|Bob, I think, based on what I saw yesterday, that the chances are pretty good that all the big blocks out here in the dark mantle area will be pretty much the gabbros. By the way, I looked at that with a hand lens last night, and I don't know that you got the report, and I'm back to saying that it's probably closer to 30 - 40 percent plagio-clase. It's very - it's a good gabbro, a final pyroxene gabbro, and it apparently has a fair amount of ilmenite in it. There's some bright shiny flakes within the vugs and some dark minerals in the matrix that are probably ilmenite. And one other additional possibility then, is that the mantling we're seeing here, is the - is just dark fine glass - darker than usual, because of the iron and the titanium in the rock itself. Also, the probability, I think, still has to be considered that you're dealing with a true mantle that has been gardened enough that at least where we're seeing it now, in the first few tenths of a centimeter that It is unrecognizable as a mantling unit yet. The relationship to the large boulders is, I think, one right now, of just filleting and a small amount of covering because of the local gardening process. We haven't seen any clearly mantling relationships between the dark mantle or the surface materials here and the large boulders.||CC|Okay. Copy that. And, we'll be anxious to see what else you find out today. And one last word for your interest; the Marshall people have decided to allow us to go to 140 degrees on this EVA with the batteries, if necessary.||CDR-LM|Okay.|05 15 48 40|CC|Okay, now. John would like to talk to you about the fender fix.|
