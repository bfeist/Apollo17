Thank you.|||CC|And, 17, I'll be unable to update that AOS time, but 52:20 is looking good.|||CDR|Roger.||00 00 14 10|LMP|Houston, can you confirm - MAIN BUS TIE A/C, OFF?|||CC|Stand by on that, Jack.||||||Tape 2/6||||00 00 14 18|LMP|I've been carrying very low amps on the BAT BUS, and I did not see a drop. I'm carrying about 2 amps now. Volts are 3 - 30.5.|||CC|Jack, go ahead and take the B/C motor switch OFF.||00 00 l4 48|LMP|Okay. It's OFF. And I confirm that one.|||CC|And we think it's the EDS POWER switch and the fuel cell ... switch that are drawing the current that you're seeing there.|||LMP|Okay. That could well be.|||CC|Okay, Jack, we're going to lose you in about 1 minute off of Vanguard here and see you at 52:20.|||LMP|Roger; we're pressing and thanks, Bob.||00 00 15 11|CDR|Okay, Bob. Everything is looking GO on board. Everything's stable. We can see the APS firing, and our altitudes look good.|||CC|Geno, everything is in good shape down here. The booster's in good shape; you're looking good; and their AOS time is 52:20 as I'gave you.|||CDR|We got that, babe. We'll see you coming around.|||CC|Good show, babe. A little late but a good show.|||CDR|Outstanding ride.||00 00 16 26|CC|17, Houston. We're hanging with you here.

Have no significant anomalies as yet; and we've just about completed our part of the insertion checklist. Gene has his SCS check yet, and Ron's got some P52 numbers for you. And the only thing I've seen so far is a - some spurious MASTER ALARM without caution and warning that seem to be associated with moving switches on panel 2.|||CC|Okay. Can you get a sudden - what switches anywhere - any ... any switches on?|||LMP|So far, it's been fairly random. Some that I remember is the SECONDARY COOLANT LOOP EVAP switch, the LAMP TEST switch, - see - I think I got one with the TEMP IN AUTO switch. Gene got one doing something. I can't remember exactly what it was.|||CC|Okay - -|||LMP|Probably random.|||CC|- - we copy. Jack, we're standing by for that P52 data. We've only got about a 4-minute - a 5-minute pass here. We'll take the 52 data, and I got a few updates for you.|||LMP|Okay.|||CMP|Okay; 52 data is coming. NOUN 71 is 24 and 30; NOUN 05 is .01; NOUN 93s are plus .080, plus .029, plus .018; and we torqued at 35:25.|||CC|Okay. We copy that. Okay, while we're filling in some here, you might want to know this, Jack. Your sunset and sunrise times in the Launch Checklist||||||Tape 3/2||||||are all off by 8 - approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds. That every - sunset and sunrise will occur about 8 minutes and 30 seconds sooner than in the - in the Launch Checklist. That's an approximate number.|||LMP|Okay, we got you.|||CC|Okay. And on page 2-17 of the Launch Checklist, you're going to want to delete all reference to Honeysuckle AOS and LOS and delete all reference to Canaries AOS and LOS.|||LMP|Wilco.|||CC|And we want to add an Ascension pass; AOS at Ascension, 01 plus 54 plus 00, and Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16.||00 00 55 13|LMP|Okay, Bob; you're going to have to repeat that.|||CC|Okay, stand by. Let me give you a page. On 2-17 - let's go Hawaii AOS first of all. On Hawaii AOS, on page 2-17. AOS - -|||LMP|Go.|||CC|- - is 01 plus 17 plus 24. Hawaii LOS, 01 plus 22 plus 49.|||LMP|Roger. Now what about the Ascension?|||CC|Okay, here - give you the Ascension again now. AOS, 01 plus 54 plus 00. Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16. Over.|||LMP|Okay, I got those. Hawaii is 01 plus 17 plus 24, and LOS is 01 plus 22 plus 49. And Ascension is AOS, 01 plus 54:00; and LOS, 02 plus 00:16.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Good copy. And booster's looking good down here and you're looking good.|||LMP|Okay, and I'll do a better job of itemizing those switches. We were pressing pretty hard, and I'll -I'll be able to go back and get most of them, I think. And we'11 keep an eye on it - on the MASTER ALARMS.||||||||Tape 3/3|||CC|Roger, Jack. We understand. And I think we copied most of what you said there, and we're working on it.|||CDR|Okay, Bob; other than that MASTER ALARM, all is well on America, and I understand the booster is looking good to you.|||CC|That's affirmative.|||LMP|And, Bob, let me add that not - we did get spurious MASTER ALARMs without switch movement, but many came with switch movements. We've had about seven.|||CC|Okay; understand.|||LMP|That was only after insertion.|||CC|Seven times that your heart doesn't need, huh?|||LMP|Oh, we were paying attention to a sunset that was the biggest - -|||CDR|Sunrise.|||LMP|- - or sunrise or something that we saw. It was the biggest rainbow I'd ever seen.|||CC|Beautiful. We can't wait to hear what you had to say about that - the ignition on the S-II. It sounded pretty spectacular.|||LMP|Bob, just let it be said that that was quite a booster ride. When we get a chance a little later - -|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|- - maybe we'll be able to tell you something.|||CC|We're about ready to lose comm here. You're looking great, guys, and we'll pick you up in Hawaii here shortly.|||CDR|Okay, we're looking at the deserts of Australia right now and, again, everything's good on board.||||||Tape 3/4|||||CC|Roger. Pick you up at 01:17:24.||00 00 58 24|LMP|Roger.||||STDN (REV 1/2)||00 01 17 25|LMP|Hello, earthlings. We're back with you.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear; how us?|||LMP|You're loud and clear. And no change systems-wise that I've seen.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Any more MASTER ALARMs?|||LMP|We had one when Ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2. ...|||CC|Okay. Sounds like we had something loose in panel 2, huh?|||LMP|Yes. 1 don't know - It may be annoying, but so far it doesn't seem to be a problem.|||CC|Roger. Just for your information, everything is looking outstanding and no problems. We're taking a good look at the data here at Hawaii, and we'll make a GO/NO GO decision about 60 seconds after acquisition at Goldstone. But there's nothing right now to lead us to believe that zero opportunity will be required.|||LMP|Okay, Bob, understand that. We are prepared, however . Spacecraft, other than those MASTER ALARMs, is looking very good. We got the docking probe extended. The SCS reference attitude check is complete.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Hey, Bob, 1 just remembered another switch that 1 think gave us a MASTER ALARM was HO QUANTITY INDICATOR.||||||||Tape 3/5|||CC|Roger. Copy that, Jack. HgO QUANTITY INDICATOR.|||CC|Roger - 17, we're going to lose you in about 30 seconds. But when you get over the stateside here, we're going to take - take the dump on the data, and we'll read it out real carefully so when you get in TLC we ought to be able to see where that MASTER ALARM glitch is coming in to.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. And - yell at me if you want anything done on the coram with this change in AOS LOS stuff.|||CC|Negative on that right now. We'll see you at 01:28:59 through Goldstone.|||CDR|Okay, 01:28:59, Bob. We'll be there.||00 01 22 48|CC|Roger, Gene.||||GOLDSTONE (REV 2}||00 01 28 00|CC|17, Houston. We're back with you.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. We're still same as before and ready when you are for TLI.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I can see the lights of southern California, Bob.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|We're going to be going a little bit south of that area.|||CC|Right. Your ground track looks like it's taking you right up over the mid part of Baja California.|||LMP|Yes, sir; I'll believe that. I'll bet you I can see Ensenada right now.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|Bob, I expect he'll probably be able to see the lights of Silver City, too.||||||Tape 3/6|||||LMP|Well, I'm sure going to be looking for them, I'll tell you.||00 01 29 59|CC|Jack, just for your information, you'll probably -when you come up a little farther in this orbit here and get over Mexico, you should be able to see all that bad weather that was giving us so much worry and had Tindall and New Orleans and everything all messed up this morning when I went through there. They had a pretty bad line of weather along there.|||LMP|I assume it wasn't too bad. I think you made it, didn't you?|||CC|Oh, yeah, I made it, but I had to - you know, I had to work at it. But it's a - we were - I was worried about it getting down as towards MILA there after - you know if we had to scrub and go tomorrow night. Boy, I'm sure glad we got you off tonight.|||LMP|Guess who else is.|||CC|No, I can't - I wouldn't believe that.|||CC|Parker can't make it back. He's got to come back on the ... So you might have to have Young on for a while after we do a TLI.|||LMP|Hey, you just wouldn't believe, Bob, the light you can see in the west right now. It must be absolutely clear.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Sounds spectacular. Jack, people in the room here want to know if you've been down your checklist yet?||00 01 31 24|LMP|Oh, we got that out of the way in about 5 minutes. Have we missed something?|||CC|There's a different checklist here we're talking about.|||LMP|(Laughter) If you're talking about the Flight Plan, yes.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 3/7|||CMP|What a waste.|||LMP|If I'm not mistaken, we must be just south of Arizona now. Is that right, Bob?|||CC|That looks real good. Yes, you're over Mexico there, and looks like you're - oh - maybe a hundred miles south of the border there.|||LMP|Okay. I was pretty sure I was looking up in the Phoenix-Tucson complex there.|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||LMP|Clear night.|||CC|Little better than ... Florida.|||LMP|The west is always that way. I wish it was daylight so we could see Sonora and that country. That's spectacular, I'll bet you.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens, Bob.|||CDR|Bob, you're coming through with a large squeal right now in the background.|||CC|Understand ...|||LMP|Okay, I think we got the Gulf Coast showing up now by the band of lights, Bob.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. Assume the booster is still looking good, and we'll be GO for a nominal TLI.|||CC|That1s affirmative.|||LMP|Okay.|||CDR|And you're still coming up with a loud squeal.|||CC|Roger. ...||||||Tape 3/8|||||CC|17, how do you read?|||CDR|No, Bob, you still got the loud squeal.|||LMP|Would you believe we're just south of Houston now, Bob?||00 01 35 17|CC|17, are you receiving Houston now?|||CDR|All right, Bob. You came up unreadable with the squeal that time.|||CC|Am I still squealing? This is Houston.|||CDR|That's affirm. You're very loud, almost unreadable with the squeal. Bob, why don't you give us the short count?|||CC|Geno, don't change anything. We think it's a ground site situation here, and just stand by.|||CDR|I believe it's in the VHP, Bob.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. I'm not sure exactly where we are, but I'm looking out - to an awful lot of horiz - lights on the horizon out there at 12 o'clock, and an awful lot of lightning in the clouds out there.|||CC|Roger. I - we show you just about over the middle of the Gulf. Looking ahead, you're probably seeing the very southern tip of Florida there.|||CDR|It looks like almost the entire Florida peninsula has got lights - got lightning on it somewhere.|||CC|Roger. How does my comm sound to you now, Gene?|||CDR|Okay, give us a quick short count.|||CC|Roger. Short count follows: 5 > 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; short count out.|||CDR|Bob, you're all right now.|||CC|Okay.||||||||Tape 3/9|||CDR|And can you give us a feel for what the final weather was at the Cape - at launch?|||CC|Yes. Let me get that for you. The reason why we had that problem on the comm is we just handed over from Texas to MILA, and we're - and you're going through MILA now. And it's great. So we have a little problem with our Texas site.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|The television coverage had you all the way through staging very well on - and the S-II ignition. Then, you went right behind a cloud for a while, but they were tracking you pretty well.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|They also - cut in for about a half minute or so and showed a view of the crowd in just the available light from the booster, and it stood out pretty well.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. We're going right over Florida now, looking down at Miami. A beautiful view of the Keys all lit up, and I just saw a shooting star right over Miami.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|That's a very, very fine view of Miami. Hard to believe.|||CC|I'll bet they sat there and watched you go.||00 01 38 44|LMP|Looks like we're right over the Bahamas now, Bob.|||CC|Roger. I'11 buy that.|||LMP|Well, I'm not easily impressed, Bob. But I'm certainly impressed by this one.|||CC|Roger. What's the CMP doing? We haven't heard much from him. Is - is he at the other window?|||CMP|He's crawling around looking for things down in the LEB.||||||Tape 3/10|||||CC|(Laughter) Okay. They won't let you have a window tonight, huh, Ron?|||CMP|No, I'll catch one here pretty quick.|||CC|Just a reminder, if you haven't already done it. There is no need to unstow the TV, because due to this late launch, there's just no site available.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. We're not going to unstow it.|||LMP|Bob, I don't - I guess there's no site available for some time, is that correct?|||CC|That's affirmative. And if I can pull one of you guys away from a window, I've got a TLI plus 90 pad.|||LMP|Oh, I'd love to copy that. Just a minute.||00 01 41 29|LMP|Hello, Houston; Apollo 17. How do you read?|||CC|17, Houston. Go ahead.|||LMP|Okay. Lost you there for a minute. We had good signal strength all through that, so I figured it was your problem.|||CC|Roger. We're just waiting here - You ready for the pad?|||LMP|We were calling you, and you missed us. So you might think about that. Ready for the pad.|||CC|Oksy.

Got you all the way through the trunnion on sextant star.||||||||Tape 3/11|||CC|Okay, we'll have to wait and pick you up at Ascension. We just had a keyhole pass at Bermuda, and a little bit of a pass at Vanguard.||00 01 43 51|LMP|Okay, I'll wait for you to finish that, and on the re adback. Okay.|||CC|That's affirmative.

Just a reminder for Ron, we'll be standing by at Ascension for the next gyro torquing and -we, might have a drift update on the - IMU there,|||LMP|Okay, he copied that. And we'll wait for the rest of the pad.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Burn time was 4:50 - I think that was when you started to cut out.|||CC|Roger.||00 01 48 11|CC|17, this is Houston through ARIA. How do you read? Over.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 4/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||00 01 48 53|CC|17 Houston through ARIA. How do you read?|||CC|17, Houston. How do you read through ARIA?||00 01 5U 07|CC|17, Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Roger. You're back with us. I'll finish up that TLI plus 90 pad so we can talk a little here if you want.|||LMP|Go ahead.||00 01 54 19|CC|Okay. Set stars are Sirius and Rigel; R^IGN is 318; 148; 358. There'll be no ullage. Okay. Down at the bottom of the pad we've got the P37 for lift-off plus 9. GET is 009:00; DELTA-V^, 4897; longitude, minus 175; GET of 400K, 033:49. Over.||00 01 55 09|LMP|Okay, Bob. Zero - Sirius and Rigel; 318; 148; 358; no ullage; 009:00; 4897; minus 175; 033:4-9. Over.|||CC|Okay, Jack. Good readback.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. We had - as usual - up here (laughter) a spectacular sunrise, and Gene wants to talk to you.|||CDR|I got some numbers on Ron's P52 for you, Bob.|||CC|Okay; standing by to copy. Go ahead.|||CDR|Okay. NOUN 71 were stars 22 and 24; NOUN 05 are all balls; NOUN 93s are all minus. They're 00.037, 00.007, and 00.021. That's minus 37> minus 07, and minus 21; and they were torqued at 01:51:40.|||CC|Okay. We copy.|||LMP|Bob, we're over - what might be - intermediate to low strata that have a very strong crenulation pattern - pulling out some geological terms here. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it -flying.||||||Tape 4/2|||||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Looks like about a north-south lineation with a very strong crinkling, roughly east-west.|||CC|Roger. Copy that; that's interesting. You know, you're just directly over that South Atlantic area. Your - you - your path just kind of kept you going right between the - Africa and South America, right dead center all the way.||00 01 57 44|CC|And, 17, just for your information, we've searched all the data we can, and we cannot find anything wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. Everything is looking real fine, and the only problem in the air is that - those master alarms that you have reported - we're not able to tie in anything common yet to any of those things either.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. We have not had any for - quite some time, I think, since the last time we talked to you about them.|||CC|Roger. Understand. We'll probably get a good workout on that after TLI and try and track it down one more.|||CDR|Okay. But, also, we have not really been doing much switching since the insertion checklist was complete, either.|||CC|Roger. Understand. It's got you glued to the windows, I guess, huh?|||CDR|They are interesting; I'll say that.|||LMP|Well, I certainly am, Bob, and - again there's a big - a fairly continuous intermediate cloud deck, I think. And it has patterns comparable to what I've seen on pictures of ice floes.|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||LMP|And - of pack ice; I should say pictures of pack ice in the Antarctic.||||||||Tape 4/3||00 01 59 00|CC|17, Houston. We've got two questions concerning the MASTER ALARMs. One, do you get the MASTER ALARM on the LEB also; and, two, do you get the tone with the MASTER ALARM?|||LMP|We did get the tones. The MASTER ALARMs were on both - panel 1 and panel 3. I can't tell you about the LEB right now. Maybe Ron can.|||CMP|No, I didn't pay that ranch attention.|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|And, Bob, there was something interesting I wanted to get around to tell you. The - MISSION TIMER down in the LEB, when Ron went down there to get things squared away, was about 15 seconds or so behind all the other clocks.|||CC|Roger. We copy that.|||CDR|Okay; and we reset it - re synced it - and it's been running okay. I don't know whether that's a clue to anything or not, but apparently it happened either during launch - or somewhere before we got down there right after insertion.|||CC|Okay. We're going to lose you here in about 9 seconds. You are GO and looking great, and we'll work on it. And if you get another MEV [?], will you check the T/FIR for us?|||CDR|Yes, sir; sure will do, Bob. We'll see you. What's our next AOS?|||CC|Stand by. It's Carnarvon at 02:25-|||CDR|Thank you.||00 02 25 18|CDR|I see you're trying.|||CC|17, Houston. How are you doing?|||LMP|Well, we're pretty good. You're wavery here a little bit on signal strength.||||||Tape 4/4|||||CC|Okay. We've got a TLI pad any time you're ready to copy it, Jack.|||LMP|Goodness; okay, let me get rid of something here. Ron, I'm putting that right underneath you.|||CC|And, guys, we'd like POO and ACCEPT, please.|||LMP|Okay.|||CC|You'll get a CSM state vector if you'll give us POO and ACCEPT.||00 02 25 51|CDR|Got POO and ACCEPT.|||LMP|Okay. Let me have my favorite pad.||00 02 25 54|CC|Okay. Here's the TLI pad. Time base 6 at 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; DELTA-Vc is 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; extraction will be at 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0, 57:10, yaw is 0; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00. Over.|||LMP|Okay, Houston. Here1s your TLI pad. 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0 57:10, 000; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00.|||CC|Good readback, Jack; and we'd like OMNI Charlie, and it's your computer, and you've got your state vector.||00 02 28 04|LMP|Okay. You've got OMNI Charlie. And, Bob, we had almost a completely weather-free pass over Africa and Madagascar. And the scenery - both aesthetically and geologically - was something like I've never seen before, for sure.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|We got odds and ends on the tape and quite a bit on the film.|||CC|Roger; good show. Are you saying that you didn't have any weather over that southern Africa there?||||||||Tape 4/5|||LMP|Not very much. Barely broken clouds in some places. Most of the countryside was clear.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|There were - patterns - like I haven't even seen in textbooks. Maybe I haven't been looking enough, but some of the desert and grassland patterns were - had the appearance of ice crystals almost, except on a megascale, if you - have ever looked at ice crystals in sand.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Or, better yet, ice crystals on your car window when you - get out early in the morning up in -northern areas.|||CC|Roger. And just be advised, we'll be standing by for the GO/NO GO for PYRO ARM when we get to Hawaii, and we'll be giving you a GO for TLI about that time.|||LMP|Okay; and we'll be ready.|||CC|And, Ron, in - on the Launch Checklist, on 2-25, on the manual and nominal S-IVB TLI-1, add 34 degrees on the nominal pad for all the pitch angles; and on the manual pad, add 34.5 degrees to all the pitch angles, and you'll have it right.|||CMP|Okay, Bob. You ... - -|||CC|And - -|||CM?|- - let me get set. That's - okay, we'll just add 34 to the nominal and 34.5 to all the manual ones ... - -|||CC|And you'll want to do that on your cue card also, Ron.|||CMP|Yes, that's affirm.|||CC|And we're about ready to LOS; we'll see you at Hawaii.||||||Tape 4/6|||||CDR|Okay, Bob, we'll see you - -|||CC|02 plus 50 at Hawaii.|||CDR|Okay, 50. And we'll be into our TLI checklist, and - we'll be ready for that PYRO ARM.|||CC|Okay.||||HAWAII (REV 2)||00 02 49 52|CC|Apollo 17, Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CMP|Houston, this is Apollo 17. Go ahead.|||CC|Hey, Ron, you're sounding great. Good voice here.|||LMP|Golly, we've got things all set up here and we're kind of standing by for a logic check - whenever you guys - can give us a GO.|||CC|Roger. As soon as we get some TM in here, we'll give you a GO.|||LMP|Okay.||00 02 50 37|CC|17, Houston. We're ready for the logic check.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. Okay. Wait 1.||00 02 50 55|CDR|Okay.

I suspect that, I think Gene said a while ago that it's around on his side also.||00 02 53 15|CC|Roger. Guys , I've got the word you wanted to hear; you are GO for TLI - you're GO for the Moon.|||CDR|Okay, Robert. I understand. America and Challenger with their S-IVB are GO for TLI.|||CC|That's affirmative.|||CDR|You're a sweet talker.|||CC|We try to please here, Gene.|||CDR|You know, somehow, Bob, I knew you were going to say that - we were GO - and that you try to please.|||CC|We've been working together too long, I guess.|||CDR|Not long enough, yet.|||CC|And, 17; Houston. You're about 1 minute from LOS, and we'll pick you up at Goldstone at about 3 hours and 00 minutes; and that's only a couple of minutes prior to time base 6 start.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. We'll be with you.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Bob, that glow is actually above the horizon, just in case you're curious. I can see - stars below the top of the glow - down closer to the Earth.||00 02 55 21|CC|Roger, Jack.||||GOLDSTONE (REV 2)||00 03 01 16|CC|17, Houston.

Don't want to forget me. We're just watching everything; we can't find anything wrong, so we're just trying to keep quiet here.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. We're watching the S-IVB tanks pressurize.||||||||Tape 4/9|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|You ought to look for the good things rather than the bad.|||CC|Well, that's good when we don't find anything wrong.|||CDR|Can't agree more.||00 03 07 30|CC|17, the chilldown is in progress, and the tank pressures are looking good.|||CDR|Okay, Bob; looking down here.||00 03 09 35|CC|17, Houston.

Understand.|||LMP|There's a whole bunce of big ones on my window down there - just bright. It looks like the Fourth of July out of Ron's window.|||CMP|Yes. Now you can see some of them in shape. They're very Jagged, angular fragments that arc-tumbling.||||||||Tape 5/3|||CC|Roger. They look like fluid of some sort?|||CMP|Not to me. They look like pieces of something.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|They're very bright.|||CC|Jack, we'd like OMNI Charlie.|||CMP|Bob, for the most part, these fragments are not -or are tumbling at a very slow rate. I tried a couple of pictures of them - different settings. You may get an idea of what, at least, the patterns look like.|||CC|Roger. I've got you. We're all ears on these fragments. Do you think you can figure out what t?iey might be?|||CMP|Well, you know I - I don't know. There are a number of possibilities. If you had some kind of a -I got the impression maybe they were curved a little bit, as if they might be - off the side of the S-IVB. And that's a wild guess - -|||CDR|Okay. RCS LOGIC is ... --|||CMP|- - ice chunks, possibly. Or maybe there's paint coming off of it.||00 03 37 34|CC|Roger. I noticed on one trip up the elevator last weak near one of the flags. I thought it was on the S-II, but it might have been on the S-IVB. Looked like it was peeling. Maybe that's what you1ve got.||00 03 37 45|CC|And the S-IVB maneuver is complete.||00 03 37 46|LMP|... in 1 minute.|||CDR|Okay. We'll set the old clock.|||CMP|Okay.

Can you see it at all, Gene?||00 03 51 20|LMP|Got one little chunk coming out - it just came out of the SLA, and It's spinning along the long axis, and it looks very stable.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Every once in a while, a small particle flies off of it though.|||CC|How big of a chunk are you talking about, Jack?|||LMP|Say again?|||CC|How big an item are you talking about?|||LMP|Oh, I - reference to the thrusters, about the same diameter as the thruster on the LM.|||CC|Oh, Roger.||||||||Tape 5/9|||LMP|That's how long it was, and about - oh, a fifth that thick or that wide.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|And I don't think - I don't think it's more than a quarter of an inch or maybe even less thick.|||CDR|That same particle, Bob, came by and as it went spinning, it was throwing off pieces of itself -radially out.|||CC|Roger. We copy.||00 03 52 31|CDR|There's a small one come floating by and it looked like flakes. And I think I caught three of the four SLA panels going as we were maneuvering. I've got one out the hatch window now. It's quite a ways out.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|It's tumbling in all three axes.|||LMP|And I saw the fourth one out my side, so we saw them all.|||LMP|Area around the two spacecraft is cleaned up pretty well by now. There are just a few fragments moving around.|||CMP|Now she's coming in.||00 03 54 58|LMP|Rover looks in good shape, so far.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Can you see down on that quad? Is that what you're looking at?|||LMP|Yes, I'm looking right at it. And I got a good view of the MESA top anyway. It's pretty well covered, but it looks all right also.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|All the antennas look good; thruster quads all look great. I could see all four of them a minute ago.||||||Tape 5/10|||||CMP|Okay, about 10 feet there, Gene. Stand by for a ... on the barber pole.|||CDR|Okay.|||CMP|All right; in good shape.||00 03 56 35|CMP|It' s out now.||00 03 56 45|CDR|Capture, Houston.|||CC|Roger. We copy.|||CMP|Okay, we're FREE; rates look pretty good. Let's lock it together.|||LMP|Okay. You ready?|||CMP|Ready. She's lined up not bad.|||CDR|Okay.|||CMP|PRIM 1.||00 03 57 03|CDR|MARK it.

Yes , Okay.|||CMP|We had one clear fire, maybe one or two latches and then a ripple fire on the rest.||||||||Tape 5/11|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|And, by the way, I had a good view into the ACT, and I can still look in there, and it's very clean.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|In fact - -|||CC|Ron and Gene, we saw your MASTER ALARM. Did you have any - anything on the matrix light up?|||CDR|No, not a thing. I looked.|||CC|Roger.||00 03 59 20|CDR|Okay, Bob, we're going to go ahead and take a look at that docking malfunction before we press on here further and check this barber pole out.|||CC|Roger, We're working some words up here. We'll be back with you in a second on that, Gene.||00 03 59 33|CDR|Okay. We're down on the checklist through the EDS POWER breakers, OPEN.|||CC|Understand.|||CDR|And, Houston, in case we didn't tell you, it's talkback A that's barber pole.|||CC|Understand. We have it.|||CC|Say - say, Gene, we don't think it's a problem. We'll find out what it is when you get in. We think we should just press right on with the Flight Plan checklist and keep going.|||CDR|Okay, we concur with that. Okay, we'll press on, Bob.||00 04 01 38|CDR|Okay, Bob. We just got a MASTER ALARM when I went to the RETRACT PRIM, from 1 to OFF.|||CC|Roger. We copy that.

We're reading a DELTA-P of greater than 4, and I'm going to open the PRESSURE EQUALIZATION VALVE now.|||CC|Roger, 17. We copy that.||00 04 08 44|CDR|Okay, the DELTA-P is coming down, Bob.|||CC|Roger.|||CC|Gene, while you're watching that, I just thought you'd be interested. We talked to some of our friends down at the Cape who watched the launch , and they said you were aglow all the way until you faded into - you couldn't tell you from a star. They saw staging, and they could just see you as a star way off in the distance until you faded out. Not a cloud in the way at all.||00 04 09 31|CDR|Beautiful. Okay, we're at - we're at 2, and we're monitoring it for 3 minutes.|||CC|Okay.||00 04 09 46|LMP|And, Houston. While we're checking the integrity here, on mag Alfa Alfa, there's about 50 percent.|||CC|Mag Alfa Alfa, 50 percent. Roger.||00 04 12 28|CDR|Okay, Bob. That's 3 minutes. It's - DELTA-P change is less than 0.1.|||CC|Three minutes and less than 0.1.|||CDR|We are pressing on.|||CC|Roger; press.||00 04 14 18|CMP|Okay, you want cabin's at 4.8 now; REPRESS is about empty.

Just be advised, you're going to have an S-IVB nonpropulsive vent start 04:18:27- You've got about 3 minutes on that.|||CDR|(Laughter) Okay. Thank you.||00 04 16 40|LMP|Can you reach ... there?|||CMP|Yes, I'll get them.||00 04 16 43|CDR|Okay, Bob. We seem to be holding DELTA-P at about 0.2. I suspect that's probably zero.|||CC|Roger. We copy that.||00 04 17 00|CDR|And the cabin pressure's about 4.5. You want us to wait until 5 psi for the EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE SELECTS?|||CC|Negative on that.

Yes.|||CC|17, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|Roger. Be advised, you don't have to wait until 5 psi cabin to go ahead and open the hatch.|||CDR|Okay, we're not, Bob. We're pressing on with it now.|||CC|Roger.||00 04 20 07|CDR|Okay, it looks like we're going to maintain about 400 on the surge.|||CMP|Okay?||00 04 20 53|CDR|Okay, Houston.

I haven't checked them all, but visually, they're all locked.|||CC|Understand, Gene. All of them are locked.|||CDR|Let me give them a good check.||||||||Tape 5/15|||CMP|Yes . You'd better check them, because we got a barber pole on that one.|||CDR|Okay, here's one that *** over.|||CMP|What is the position of it?|||CDR|7 #**|||CMP|7 and 9?|||CDR|Hey, Bob. Maybe we aren't all going to be so happy.|||CC|Go ahead.|||CDR|Okay, 7,9, and 10 - the handle is flush; the bungee is vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the - and the red button is showing. And I can pull each one of them back slowly. I haven't done anything with them. That's 7, 9, and 10.|||CC|Roger. We copy that. The handle is flush; the bungees are vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the red button is showing on 7, 9, and 10.|||CDR|That's affirm.||00 04 23 58|CDR|Okay, Bob. Bob, I just pushed the handle on 10 home a little bit and it did lock. And the red button is flush. So that leaves me 9 and 7?|||CC|Roger; understand.|||CC|Geno, go ahead and try the handle on 9 and 7; and, if that doesn't work, cock them and refire them starting with 9, please.|||CDR|Okay; the handle doesn't work. I'll have to recock them.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|When you trip it with your - did you cock it twice?||||||Tape 5/16|||||CDR|Yes.|||CMP|And it took two cocks to make it go?|||CDR|Yes.||00 04 25 04|CDR|Okay, 9 cocked twice; it tripped. It is overcenter and locked.|||CC|Roger. How about the barber pole now?|||CMP|Okay. Wait a minute, I've got - DOCKING PROBE MAIN A circuit breaker's IN and gone to RETRACT, and it's gray.|||CC|Okay - -|||CDR|Aha! That did it.|||CC|Roger.|||CC|And -||00 04 25 47|CDR|Okay, Bob. Cocked 7 twice and tripped it, and it's overcenter and locked.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|I think that takes care of them all.|||CC|Good show.||00 04 26 34|CMP|Okay, DOCKING PROBE circuit breakers are OUT and EXTEND/RETRACT is OFF.||00 04 26 48|CMP|Because it belongs on the probe. ... it's painted yellow, it belongs on the probe.||00 04 28 08|CDR|Okay, Bob.

We've got some new - new angles here for you.|||LMP|Stand by a minute, and let me find a place to copy them.|||CMP|What - what kind of angles are they, Bob?|||CC|They're your NOUN 22 attitude maneuver for APS burn out of the hatch window. They're in the middle of the page L/3-5-|||CMP|Oh, okay.|||CC|Instead of 270, we want 274.|||CMP|Wait 1. We're not quite with you.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|Okay. I think I'm with you at 3-7; go.|||CC|It's on 3-5, Jack, middle of the page there. Those NOUN 22s.|||LMP|Okay, I take it back; 3-5, middle of the page.|||CC|Okay. You notice there's three angles there -270, make that 274.|||LMP|Okay. That the only change?|||CC|And the - N, the next one, the 129-8, change that to 164. And 4.3 on the yaw, change that to zero. It's close enough; zero on the yaw.||||||Tape 5/18|||||LMP|Okay. We got them 274, 164, 00.|||CC|Roger, and the high-gain angles that you've got on the Flight Plan are close enough and should do it.|||LMP|Very good.||00 04 39 23|CMP|Okay.

Used to seeing them more or less lined up, and I hadn't calculated any further than that.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|02 - 02 seems a little higher H , relatively speaking.|||CMP|Okay. That's pretty close.

Yaw maneuver started.|||LMP|The old S-IVB had a flare for the dramatic, but it certainly did its job for us.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Preliminary data indicate that you are about as nominal as you can be.|||CDR|That's the way we'd like to keep it, Bob.|||CC|You'd better believe it.|||CDR|Okay. She's - as we're looking at it, she's pitching up. She was looking right at us - we were looking right at the dome - and now she's pitching up. The shroud around the IU seems to be totally intact. It - it looked like a super clean separation. I can't really see where there's any paint or anything externally chipped off the -the booster from here. We're beginning to - to pick up the bell. It's really a shame you don't have this - this whole thing on TV; it's really quite a sight.|||CC|Roger. We concur with that.|||CDR|The Mylar and the gold coating on the inside of the shroud that's now visible is also intact. It looks like you could use it again if you could get it back.|||CC|Well, it's got a job to do when it hits the Moon yet.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. We've - we're almost looking at it broadside now.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 6/3|||CDR|Okay. She's spitting a little; looks like the yaw maneuver may be complete.|||CDR|We got a - full view of the - entire J2 from here; and no kidding, Bob, the whole bird, the shroud at the top by the IU, the separation plane down by the S-II, from here all looks as clean as a whistle, all the way.|||CC|Roger, Gene. If you're happy, we'd like a GO from you for the evasive burn.|||CDR|Okay. You're going to burn on the boosters plus X-axis, is that right?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||CDR|Let's get a picture or two here yet, and we'll give you a GO.|||CC|And, Gene, it'll be about 7 minutes until the evasive burn; 5 plus 03.||00 04 56 31|CDR|Okay. You have a GO.|||LMP|And for your reference, at frame 105 I started a few 250-millimeter pictures of the S-IVB.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||CDR|And, Bob, the entire sky, as far as I can make it out through the hatch window, is completely filled with our twinkling flakes.|||CC|Roger. We copy that.|||LMP|I saw a couple particles go by the window awhile back, and it looked a little bit like insulation in this - these particular case - styrofoam insulation , but in flat flakes.|||CC|Roger that.|||LMP|That was right after we separated from the S-IVH.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|CSM sep - CSM sep, Bob.||||||Tape 6/4|||||CC|Roger.

Beautiful.|||CDR|Very fine; glad to hear that.|||SC|... velvet touch.|||CMP|Still a little bit too much, but that's not bad.|||CDR|We'll be glad to leave all that extra, I hope, in the service module when we get home.|||CMP|It's in the Volkswagen pouch down there.|||LMP|Oh, I'll change the lens now.||||||||Tape 6/5|||CC|17, Houston.

How1s that sound?|||CC|Sounds like a winner, Gene.|||CDR|Okay.|||LMP|I guess you saw that one, Houston. That had no caution or warning with it.|||CC|Roger. That a MASTER ALARM?|||LMP|Yes, sir.|||CC|How about the LEB?|||LMP|... say again. (Laughter) You caught me. I forgot to look. Keep after us; we'll get you that data point.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|Gene's got his hands all over panel 2, which probably is what caused it.|||CC|Jack, we think that might have been a real one due to the accumulator cycle with the O2 makeup flow going on there - it gave - it held the 0 flow higher for - greater than l6 seconds.||00 05 11 35|LMP|Well, that's certainly a possibility. We didn't notice it - Looked upright at the time. But it -Sure that was the right time?|||CC|Well, EECOM's watching it here, and he feels Lb .in|||LMP|Gee, I can't argue with him.|||LMP|Okay, Houston. Ready to deactivate the primary evaporator if you concur.||||||||Tape 6/7|||CC|Roger, Jack. We concur.||00 05 15 18|LMP|Okay, Bob. VHF SIMPLEX Alfa's OFF.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|And we're gradually moving into getting out of the suits.|||CC|Yes. I'll bet you're looking forward to that.|||LMP|Well, I'll tell you it's a different world without that old one g on you. The old suit's a little bit friendlier.|||LMP|And, as you may have noticed, Bob, we've come to the end of the Launch Checklist.|||CC|That's affirmative, and we've put ours away for posterity. We also stored it with our TLI zero data that we worked so hard to generate.|||LMP|Well, I'm just happy - didn't - use it. That view of the Earth for a rev there was something I was looking forward to and I was not disappointed.|||CC|That's great, Jack.|||CDR|Bob, you've got a pretty good size storm over the north - I guess the northwestern coast of India, where it starts to wrap up and around to the west. It's a - rounded out on the horizon, so I can't make out exactly where it is too well.|||CC|Roger.|||CC|Could we get a read-out on the LM/CM DELTA-P?||00 05 18 20|LMP|Plus 0.4.|||CC|Roger. We copy that. '|||CDR|Bob, Antarctica is what I would call effectively just a solid white cap down on the - South Pole. There's definite contact between the continent and the water. But, as Ron said, most of the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque - some in clockwise rotating fashion but appear to be||||||Tape 6/8||||||very thin where you can, for the most part, kind of see through those clouds to the blue water below.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|The continent - the continent itself is - is the same color as the clouds; but, of course, more dense - and striking difference than any of the other white background around because you can definitely see that contact with the water and with the clouds over the water.|||CC|Roger. Understand. There'll soon be a comm switch over to Madrid here shortly. We may break ... in just a few minutes here. Or a few seconds, rather.|||CC|And you might watch - your accumulator's going to cycle in about 20 seconds here. Let's see what happens on the MASTER ALARM.|||CC|17, Houston. How do you read through Madrid?||00 05 20 36|CMP|You're loud and clear, Bob, and could you give us our distance from the Earth?|||CC|Roger. I'm looking up at the board. I'd guess at about 19,000 miles. Want me to get it exact?|||CMP|No, just approximate's good enough.|||CC|18,100, FIDO says.|||CDR|Okay. And I suppose we're seeing as 100 percent full Earth as we'll ever see; certainly as I've ever seen. It appears to be - it may be a little bit - a little bit of a terminator way out to the -well, to the east - out beyond Australia and beyond India. But beyond that it's about 99 percent pure.|||CDR|Bob, it's these kind of views - these kind of views that stick with you forever.|||CC|Roger, Gene.||00 05 22 39|CDR|We've got a - I guess probably the continent of Africa dominates the world right now. It's covering the - oh, the upper third - upper and western||||||||Tape 6/9||||third of the - of the world. We can see the Sinai; we can see up into the Mediterranean; we can see across the Mediterranean, although we can't quite make out the countries up there; we can see across into India. I catch a glimpse of Australia out in the far horizon. Got Zanzibar on the southern tip of Africa, the Cape down there just almost directly below us. And, I don't know exactly how big Antarctica is, but I guess we can certainly see more than 50 percent of it. And - the rest of it is all ocean. The Indian Ocean out into the Pacific Ocean and back into the Atlantic Ocean. And for the most part relatively clear of clouds except in the Antarctica region, and up towards Europe which is - which is on the horizon, across the Mediterranean, it looks like there might be some clouds back up in that way. I probably -probably - well, not probably - I can make out the entire coast of Africa from Mediterranean around to the west, coming back to the south back where it takes its big dip to the east , back around the Cape, back around up through the Suez Canal, almost perfectly.|||CC|Roger. We understand.|||CDR|And there's one batch of clouds in northern Africa, just a small batch, it looks like it may be up near the - well, no, it's not near the mouth of the Nile; it's quite a bit west of that, as a matter of fact, I can see the mouth of the Nile; I can see it running straight down towards us as it parallels the Suez and then sort of fades out into the central darker brown or darker green portions of Africa.|||CC|Roger, Gene. Sure be nice to have that on TV, wouldn't it?|||CDR|Boy, I'd love to give it to you; any way I could.|||CDR|You know - and there's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.|||CC|Roger. I just was - going through the 17 status report on CSM systems and, boy, everything is absolutely nominal, with the exception of glitching MASTER ALARMs that we're trying to ntii.l track down; but every other system is just nominal. Everything is great.||||||Tape 6/10||||00 05 26 01|CDR|Okay. Sounds good. That's the way they built it for us.|||CC|Gene, looking at our plot board, you're directly over the southern tip of Africa or just slightly out in the Indian Ocean there, according to our plot board, which isn't exactly accurate all the time. But shortly you're going to start going backwards on the Earth here and head back across the Atlantic. That ought to be some sort of a first. You cross the Atlantic twice, going from west to east, and then, now you're going to cross it going from east to west here shortly. All in a very short span of time.||00 05 27 40|CDR|Yes. I guess that does sound like a first.||00 05 29 53|CDR|Bob, I can assume that from what you said there will be - probably not be a midcourse 1?|||CC|That's exactly what we're working towards, Gene. And I - I'm sorry I didn't convey that feeling to you a little earlier. There's no reason for mid-course 1 right now.|||CDR|Okay. Because we prefer to press on and get the suits off and hit the sack rather than make It, unless we have to.|||CC|That's for sure. Roger. The earlier data showed us midcourse 1 would have been less than 3 feet per second, and we wouldn't have done it. And the data's been fluctuating, but they're smoothing it out, and it's still holding that way; so we won't be doing it, probably.|||CDR|Okay. Very good.|||LMP|Bob, I'm looking over Gene's shoulder here at the Earth, and it must be an awful clear day for the so-called convergence zone across Africa. Gene, I think, Indicated, as it looked to us as we crossed it earlier, most of Africa is clear. Only some - probably are broken and scattered clouds -cumulus in the east central portion that are running along the line of - north/south lines.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 6/11|||LMP|Looks like a major circulation system off the southern tip of Africa, as Gene mentioned, plus one west of that, 20 or 30 degrees of longitude. Make that east of that.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|And, southwest of the - make that south southwest of the tip of Africa at Cape Good Hope, there looks like an incipient circulation system developing about half way between the coast of Antarctica and Africa. If I had to guess, it's going to swing up north towards the Cape and - and then swing west The whole pattern, ... it looks like now, is a fairly equally spaced cyclones that are sort of circling around the Antarctic continent, as we can see it now.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||00 05 33 50|LMP|But I would guess that South Africa is going to have good weather for several more days, at least. And if the pattern is - is apparent in the clouds we see is correct, the last disturbance I mentioned probably is going to pass south of the Cape also,|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||LMP|As we were going - over our daylight around the Earth in orbit, it was very clear looking at the various clouds, Bob, what were high clouds and what were low clouds, particularly when you had them together. The high clouds cast very distinct shadow patterns on the lower ones and, very commonly, had entirely different orientations -pattern orientations. The low ones seem to be more associated with arcuate front patterns; whereas, the high clouds were generally transverse to that, roughly north/south directions. That's not completely general observation, but I noticed it several times.|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||CC|I just noticed on the plot board here, it looks like you're come up on 20,000 miles out, right about now.||||||Tape 6/12||||00 05 35 27|LMP|It feels like about, 20,000 miles.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Bob, I have the first hint of contamination on window 5* It's covering, probably, the central -well, I'd say, - roughly around - it's square about - 7 inches in - on the side with a very thin film that's catching the sunlight; and slightly irridescent, but also very finely granular - very finely granular. You can just barely tell what it is, actually.|||CC|Roger. Understand.||00 05 37 45|LMP|Looks like very uniform in thickness right now.||00 05 46 31|LMP|Bob, this is Jack. We've got a UCTA dump scheduled, or is possible, at 6 o'clock. There's nothing sacred about that time, is there?|||CC|Nothing at all. Whenever you're ready, just go ahead and dump.||00 05 49 03|LMP|Okay.|||LMP|Bob, one of the things that we miss in our training is a good geography lesson, and particularly on Antarctica. I got the monocular out, and apparently the dark band that Gene - Ron mentioned as interface between the continental water is that between the pack ice and the water. And you can, by very subtle changes in the apparent smoothness of the ground, probably make out where the actual continent begins and the pack ice ends. There are a few exposed ranges, I guess it's midsummer down there now, and you can make out the snow-free areas scattered at least in the northern portion of the continent.|||CC|Roger. Did you get any pictures of that, Jack?|||LMP|Oh, yes. We got some pictures earlier. I'm going to get another one here in a minute. I'll tell you, if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 6/13||00 05 50 21|CDR|And we got a MASTER ALARM.|||CC|Okay. We copy that.|||CDR|And there's one in the LEB.|||CC|Okay. Good data point.|||CDR|And there are no caution lights.|||CC|It came right ... accumulator cycle, along with the high O2 flow again.|||CDR|Yes, I just checked the time, and I think you are right on that one. Well, we gave you your LEB data point.|||CC|Yes, sir.|||LMP|The problem with looking at the Earth (laughter) particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright.|||CC|Understand.|||LMP|And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular, which is not the best (laughter) viewing platform. I think I can see some of the areas of the Dry Valley, but, again, I'm not too sure of my geography, Bob. There are clouds over the continent, I believe. But, of course, they're just as white as the snow, and you only see differences in texture brought out by - probably varying photometric return because of fairly low sun angles down there.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|But you can see patterns of what I believe is pack ice - leading off from that sharp interface that was talked about earlier. And those patterns seem to merge directly with the patterns of the clouds as if the - at least near the continent -the oceanic currents are controlling the air currents, up to a point , along with the movement of the pack ice.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 6/l4|||||LMP|I'm distinguishing the pack ice from clouds mainly by the angularity of the patterns within them. There is no good clear color or albedo distinction. So, I could - I could be looking entirely at clouds, but I suspect there are some pack ice patterns, too. I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?|||CC|No, sir. Just keep talking; we're listening. And I'm sure not much of the world is listening, but this will all be recorded, and you can read it all when you get back and think it through and tie it up with the pictures. And I'm sure there's going to be people interested in this. And we're interested ourselves; just keep talking.||00 05 53 29|LMP|All I want to do is read what I say.|||CC|Roger. If I had a little more geology training, I'd be asking you some better questions. I'm afraid, right now, I can't think of anything to ask you.|||LMP|Well, I can't - I really wish I knew that geography. I don't know - I wish I'd thought of bringing a good map of Antarctica. Could somebody do a little researching for me and see if they could tell me if we're - have a Little American view - say on the eastern edge of the continent?|||CC|Roger. We'll see if we can get some Antarctica geographers around.|||LMP|Yes, I'd like to - and, also, whether or not they think the Dry Valley area is visible to us. Let's see, there's some - some of the people over there in Bill Bennett's group, I think, have a little Antarctic experience, or used to. They might be able to help you out.|||CC|Okay. We'll see what we can track down on it.|||LMP|Don't use up a lot of people's time on it, but -but I'd be interested.|||CC|Roger. It's getting pretty empty around here. It's 5:00 in the morning, so - (laughter)||||||||Tape 6/15|||LMP|Okay. There is a good strong northern hemisphere cyclone up near India, and I think Gene mentioned that. It, I think, was one I saw in some of the forecast sheets as a dissipating hurricane or typhoon. I'm not sure which it is there. I guess it's a typhoon. And I see something here that I noticed in Earth orbit, Bob. That as you approach the terminator - and now I'm looking at the eastern terminator - have to keep all my directions straight here - yes, eastern terminator. The clouds - those associated with the cyclone over India and one that's - appears to be due south of there - maybe 30 degrees of latitude - have a gray appearance. The - instead of the brilliant white of other clouds as you approach the terminator, those - at least the high level clouds are gray. Now, when we were going over them in orbit, the lower level clouds were still white, and I think I can see a hint of that right now. The Sun gives a strong light reflection off of the buildups in the low-level clouds; whereas, the high-level and probably layered cirrus and maybe some of the intermediate level stratus tend to look gray because of grazing Sun, I suspect.||00 05 56 46|CC|Roger. You mentioned something in Earth orbit that kind of intrigued me. You mentioned seeing the rainbow, and we were trying to figure out how you saw a rainbow up there. And you were in orbit already at that time. Do you remember that?|||LMP|Well, - we're not - we were speaking of the merits of the sunrise.|||CC|Okay. Roger.|||LMP|Of having a banded color appearance that varied as you approached sunrise. I can't remember what we - I think we put some of that on tape, and we were probably LOS at the time. But the banded character of the sunrise in the atmosphere was very, very marked. There was a gray-blue upper layer followed - that merged or graded Into a brilliant blue intermediate zone that was just above the cloud levels. And within the clouds, you cot a orange to yellow band, getting more yellow as the Sun rose, that was broken by the dark patterns of the buildups.||||||Tape 6/16|||||CC|Roger. Good show.|||LMP|The interesting thing was the continual glow on the horizon we had, even at night, on the darkside pass -And that glow was in the atmosphere because I could see stars rise over the horizon in it and then pass on through it.|||CC|Roger. You were talking - the airglow, I guess, is the phenomenon most of the guys had seen before. It's kind of Interesting, huh?|||LMP|Yes, that's - that's right. It's interesting - I guess standard airglow, but it is very striking that it's a continuous thing even in the dark pass.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I think I did see the eastern tip of South America, now.|||CC|Roger. You're starting to back up now, coming the other way. So you're still over Africa, according to our chart here, but you're backing up towards the - South America.|||LMP|Yes, I can see the part of South America that Mercator thought that fitted in with the bend in Africa so many decades ago and started people thinking about moving continents around on the crust.|||CC|Roger. Jack, how'd the PGA doffing go? Most of you - are you all out of the PGAs now?||00 06 00 01|LMP|That's in work. We're taking it slow and easy up here, Bob.|||CC|Roger. Understand. I'll just be curious to see if they all fit in that bag.|||LMP|I think you'll find that Ronald Evans will also be curious about that. He's already made comments.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Bob, you certainly do have a very clear inlui t, i v<-impression, although the evidence is hard to pull||||||||Tape 6/17||||together, that the - any frontal systems that move off the Antarctic continent do not take on any well-defined character until they get into the ... regions of the ocean. And when they do, they seem to pick up an arcuate circ - circulation that, in the view we have, seem to get fairly regularly spaced cyclone patterns that lie between the Jape of Good Hope and northern portion of Antarctica.. And these - circulations of cyclones follow roughly an east/west pattern, and the curve - and the arcs of the fronts are more north/south than - let's say northwest, swinging around to the south.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|All of them - all of them very - very nicely defined as southern hemisphere cyclones. There are about four of those visible swinging around -oh, I guess, that's latitude - I'm having to guess here, but I'd say latitude 50 to 60 south.|||CC|Okay; 50 or 60 south on that, huh?|||LMP|Yes, I have to look at the map here in a minute and see if that puts me between Antarctica and the Cape.|||CC|Roger.|||CC|Well, the tip - the tip of Africa there is at about 32 south.|||LMP|Well, that sounds like a pretty good guess, then. It looks like the intertropical convergence zone over Africa is starting to get more and more clouds in it now. I suspect as midday approaches, which is what we're seeing there, we can expect to see more and more moisture indications.|||CC|Roger. They're - they're probably about noontime right there right now. It's 11:36 at the zero meridian at Greenwich, so it's just a little bit before noon right in that area you're talking about.|||LMP|Yes, some of those masses of what I suspect are cumulus buildups - well, not really. They don't||||||Tape 6/18||||||look like they're as concentrated and localized. More like just masses of fairly dense clouds that are developing in that band of green that crosses the lower portion of Africa.|||CC|Roger.||00 06 04 19|LMP|Stay tuned for the next installment on the Earth. I'll try to get out of this suit.|||CC|Okay. Just take it easy, Jack, and we'll be listening.|||LMP|Man, I've never taken it so easy in my life. I'll tell you, Bob, I couldn't have believed this would be an experience like it is now.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Every time you turn around, there is something else to see and wonder what's causing it. Whether it's a particle zipping across the window, or one zipping across the cabin, or spring mechanics here in zero g; there's always something going on.|||CC|Roger.||00 06 10 20|LMP|Bob, if I'm not waking you up, an observer from another planet certainly - probably could decide that we have such things as clouds and at least large thunderstorms because right at the terminator you get a brightening of the sunlit side and a long, long shadow out to the - out to the east that is reminiscent of what we saw in the early days looking at the Moon at the terminator.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|However, in the next pass around, I'll bet you wouldn't see them.|||LMP|I've never been a big - Well, I didn't grow up with the idea of drifting continents and sea-floor spreadings, but I tell you, when you look at the way the pieces of the - of the northeastern portion of the African continent seem to fit together separated by a narrow gulf, you could almost make a believer of anybody.||||||||Tape 6/19|||CC|Roger. It's beginning to look like the globe that you might buy down at the store, huh?|||LMP|Oh, I don't think so, Bob. (laughter)|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|I don't think we'd better put this one up for sale. Somewhere there might be somebody who would like to buy it.||00 06 12 53|CC|Say, Jack. We noticed the O2 flow has dropped||||down now. We're wondering, did you all close the waste storage vent valve?|||CMP|I don't think so; let me check on that. It might have gotten closed inadvertently in this game we were playing down in the LEB.|||LMP|Ron says it's still on VENT.|||CC|It's on VENT. Roger.|||CC|Okay. We're noticing the flow is coming back up slowly; so something caused it to drop, and it's coming back up.||00 06 13 42|LMP|Okay.||00 06 18 09|CC|17, Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Jack, just to ease those words I said before, we looked at the schematics here a second, and you'd be dumping urine out of that same line as that waste vent, and that would probably cause the pressure to build up enough to slow the O2 flow. And we noticed that the O2 flow is climbing back up to where it belongs.|||LMP|Well, that's clever. Okay.|||CC|Didn't mean to worry you there. Shouldn't have said it, I guess, before we looked at the schematic.||||||Tape 6/20|||||LMP|Oh, I really hadn't started to worry about it yet, Bob, so no sweat.||||END OF TAPE||||||||||||Tape 7/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||00 06 22 44|LMP|How'd the S-IVB work go, Bob?|||CC|They just finished their second burn, and it's targeted right where they want it.

We've been discussing the question of what your sleep configuration is going to be in terms of headsets or not, particularly with reference to all of these various MASTER ALARMs. And I guess we'd feel better if one of you guys slept with his headset on. We were curious as to what your plans are?|||CDR|Bob, since I've got to wear the biomed anyway, I might just as well go ahead and keep it on.|||CC|Okay. The other option is for us, - if we were trying to get hold of you - is to put the Klaxon up. But we're a little - un-in-favor of that, because of the possibility of one of these spurious things waking everybody up that way.|||CDR|Yes, I'll go ahead and keep it on and see how it works out for a while.|||CC|Okay. We copy that. And, when you guys are ready, we have a couple of - we have three items to read up to you, three updates in the Flight Plan.|||CMP|Okay. Go ahead, Bob.||00 08 15 34|CC|Okay. The first's in the Flight Plan itself, and it's the quads for the PTC spinup, and they'll be Alfa and Bravo.|||CMP|Okay. For PTC spinup, quads Alfa and Bravo.||oo 08 16 06|CC|All right, we just took that back. It should be Bravo and Delta for spinup; Alfa and Bravo only for damping. Copy Bravo and Delta for spinup; Alfa and Bravo for damping.||00 08 17 45|CC|And, 17, if you have that, I have two others. One in the Flight Plan Supplement Book, and the other one is in the G&C Checklist.||||||Tape 8/4|||||CMP|Okay. Go with the Supplement.|||CC|Okay. In the Flight Plan Supplement, we have an E-LOAD update on page 1-43. Okay; 1-43 - give me a call when you get to that page.|||CMP|Okay, Bob. I'm there.||00 08 18 23|CC|Okay. Under line - it's 307 04, column Bravo -you'll find currently 33550. And let me give you a word of warning. When we change this, we'll be changing it again around 67 hours. These are primarily due to the launch delay. And we'll give you another GET update of this sort later on. The new number to replace 3 - -|||CMP|Bob--|||CC|Go ahead.|||CMP|Let me get a pencil, please.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|I'll use that instead of a pen.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|Go ahead.||00 08 20 03|CC|Okay. Under - Again, I remind you, 307 04 column Bravo, which was 33550, is now 34761. The line just below it, which is 05, also in column Bravo, is 15403. Over.|||CMP|Okay, Bob. For 30704 Bravo, 34761; and for 310 05 Bravo, 15403.|||CC|Okay. Very good. The next one is in the G&C Checklist under the P37 block data. And to help you find it, that's on page 4-23-|||CMP|Okay. Go ahead.||00 08 21 20|CC|Okay. On the lift-off plus 15, be the first block. It's 015:00, 3893, minus 174, 057:56. The second||||||||Tape 8/5||||block for lift-off plus 25 is 05 - Pardon me, start over again there; 025:00, 6651, minus 175, 057:25. Over.|||CMP|Okay, Houston; Apollo 17. First one would be 015:00, a DELTA-V of 3893, minus 174, and GET^^ is 057:56. The other one is T. of 025:00, DELTA-V of 6651, longitude of minus 1751 GET of 400K is 057:25-|||CC|Roger. Good readback.||00 08 23 13|LMP|Okay, Bob. This is Jack. I'm going to be moving into the presleep checklist here. Are there any things you want to change or alter in that? Are you ready for the waste - waste stowage vent to be closed?||00 08 23 30|CC|Roger, 17. We're ready for the vent valve to go closed. WASTE STOWAGE VENT to CLOSED. And we have no anticipated changes, at the present time, in the Flight Plan, Jack.|||LMP|Okay, I'm just looking at 1-29 in the presleep checklist and - wondering if there was anything there.|||CC|Stand by, Jack.||00 08 24 43|CC|Okay, 17. For antenna management tonight, we'd like you to select OMNI Bravo at the current time, and stow the high-gain antenna. And we'll take care of managing our antennas from here on.|||CMP|Okay. We'll give you OMNI Bravo and stow the high-gain.|||CC|Okay.|||CC|And, Jack, we indeed do not have anything to add to the presleep checklist tonight.|||LMP|Okay.||00 08 25 56|LMP|And - with your concurrence, I'll take the H FANS all to AUTO now.||||||Tape 8/6|||||CC|Stand by.||00 08 26 07|CC|Roger. We're ready for that. All to AUTO.||00 08 27 10|CC|Okay, Jack. I guess that you - we're not quite sure what you said or meant there - or what - what it is. In the Flight Plan itself, we want H2 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO, and we want FANS, on tank 3 only, to AUTO. They're three there for Hg tank 3.|||LMP|Okay. You're teaching me to read carefully early, aren't you?|||CC|We're trying. The 1 and 2 HEATERS will be in AUTO and 3 FAN will be in AUTO.||00 08 27 46|LMP|That's the way it is now, and consider the fans have been cycled.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|According to the checklist, you might look at the third line on 1-29, and look at the H2 line on the Flight Plan, and see why I was confused.|||CC|Roger. We were just discussing whether or not there was a fan or fans in each tank.|||LMP|That ought to keep you awake this morning.|||CC|Going to take something.|||LMP|What I was really trying to do, Bob, was get out of chlorinating the potable water, but you wouldn't bite.|||CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Over, Jack.|||LMP|Go ahead. Over, Bob.||00 08 31 33|CC|Okay. We're going to give you a little high-gain antenna practice here. We'd like to pick up with the high-gain antenna again so that we can get your PTC or can watch your PTC develop. We'd like you||||||||Tape 8/7||||to go to a PITCH of 40 and YAW of 275 on the HIGH GAIN. That's 40, PITCH: 275, YAW; and MANUAL and WIDE. Over.|||LMP|Okay. You want the higji gain selected, I presume.|||CC|That helps, yes.||00 08 32 15|LMP|You got it.|||CC|Roger. Our apology.|||LMP|Oh, I don't expect that'll be the last time you have to apologize. I think we're running about even now.|||LMP|You're missing quite a view, Bob. Sorry you're not here.|||CC|"That makes two of us. White just said; ""That makes three of us."""|||LMP|What are you trying to tell me?|||CC|Look out.|||LMP|Who's your friend off on your right, tonight?|||CC|Wally Moon, would you believe?|||LMP|Say again?|||CC|Wally Moon.|||LMP|Oh, a Moon, huh? Why don't you ask him what he's reading at H2 tank 3 quantity?|||CC|Okay. I'm asking him.|||LMP|In percent.||00 08 34 05|CC|Okay, 17. On tanks 3 of H2, we're reading 84.38.||00 08 34 13|LMP|Okay, it looks like we're reading almost the same nowadays.|||CC|Good.||||||Tape 8/8|||||LMP|I thought we launched a little bias, but I guess that's gone now. We're a little higher than that.||00 08 36 09|CC|And, 17, Houston. We're seeing your rates are quite low enough to start the spinup to PTC.|||CMP|Okay. We'll see if we can't get it right this time.|||CMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead, 17.|||CMP|Does it make any difference with the plus or minus roll there with the - now that you are going to use the high gain?|||CC|Okay. Well, the Flight Plan says minus roll, why don't we do it that way?|||CMP|Oh, okay.||00 08 38 59|CC|And after you start the roll, 17, we'd like to go back to OMNI Bravo and stow the high gain.|||CMP|Okay.|||CC|We only needed the high gain to just keep a good check on your rates.|||CC|And, 17, that means stow the high gain after you -after the startup. We'd like to watch the startup itself.|||CMP|Okay. I was just going to ask you when.||00 08 42 18|CC|Okay, 17- We're ready for high gain to stow and select OMNI Bravo.|||CMP|Okay.||00 08 49 35|CC|17, Houston. We gather you're ready for sleep, almost. One thing we'd like to check at the end here is your O2 heater configuration. Over.|||CMP|Okay. Go ahead, Bob .|||CC|Roger. Can you give us your 0 heater configuration?||||||||Tape 8/9|||CMP|Okay. We've got 1 and 2 in AUTO, and 3 is OFF.|||CC|Okay. We'd like those per the Flight Plan; 1 and 2 to OFF, and 3 to AUTO.||00 08 50 09|CMP|Okay; 1 and 2 to OFF and 3 to AUTO.|||CC|Okay. And do you have a final change or update on the film status - beyond that 130 that Jack gave us?||00 08 50 19|CMP|Stand by 1.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 9/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||00 08 58 03|CC|And, 17, your PTC is looking real good so far.|||CDR|Okay. That number on that mag is still 130, Bob.|||CC|Okay. I copy that, Gene.|||CDR|And Alfa Alfa, that l6-millimeter mag, is about 25 percent left.|||CC|Okay; copy that as well.|||CC|And I guess as soon as you change the LiOH canister, if you have or haven't, and charge BATTERY Bravo, then we're ready for you to sleep at your leisure. Configuring your comm, remember the SQUELCH, ENABLE, and the VOICE, OFF, when you get ready to go to sleep.||00 08 59 31|CC|Roger, Apollo 17. We copy the film update, and we're ready for you to go to sleep once you've got the LiOH canister changed, if you haven't. And remember also the charge on brady - BATTERY Bravo. After that, it's just the comm configuration, SQUELCH, ENABLE, and VOICE, OFF, when you get ready to go to sleep.|||CDR|Roger. You cut in and out. Stand by. We'll talk to you in a minute.|||CC|Okay, I think we're losing an omni here.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tapes 10-12/1||||APOLLO 17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||||REST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS||||||||Tape 13/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||00 15 02 57|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. Good morning.|||CDR|Hello, Robert.|||CC|Glad to have you with us again. You guys got a good night's sleep, we think.|||CDR|Well, I'll tell you, it was (laughter) looked forward to.|||CDR|Give us a few minutes here and we'll - get operational.|||CC|Roger. Give us a call when you're ready to talk to people.|||CDR|Okay.||00 15 09 44|CDR|Yes, from the looks of things, Bob, down there, it looks like getting off last night was a good idea.|||CC|Got a new CAP COM now, Geno. Why? Looks kind of cloudy down there?|||CDR|Yes. Hello, Gordo. How you doing? Yes, I'm looking - oh, we're probably directly over - just west of the - out in the Pacific, but abeam of the bottom third of South America, I suppose. And I've got North America, Mexico, and the U.S. on the top third - the top 25 percent of the Earth. And it looks like you've got cloud cover from somewhere where the coast bends around Corpus right on north into the Great Lakes and is completely out into the Atlantic, including covering Florida out there.|||CC|Roger. I can verify the part between the Cape and Houston, anyway.|||CDR|Yes, the Gulf looks like it's pretty well filled with clouds. Looks pretty thick from here.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 13/2|||||CDR|However, if you're interested in going to South America, the whole continent looks - looks pretty good. A few clouds; but, for the most part, you can see the entire continent.|||CC|Roger. Guess it's summertime down there.|||CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're - we're stirring slowly. We'll get back with you here.|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|Gordo, one question. How does the spacecraft look to you? I didn't hear anything all night long as far as any MASTER ALARMs or anything.|||CC|I'm getting the word that nothing was seen here either. It looks absolutely super.|||CDR|Very good.||00 15 15 26|CDR|Okay, Bob - or Gordo, I've got H2 HEATERS 1 and 2, OFF, now.|||CC|Roger, Gene.||00 15 16 54|CDR|Hello, Houston; America.|||CC|Go ahead, America.|||CDR|Okay, Gordo. I'm looking over the Flight Plan today. We'll be with you with the postsleep checklist, and primarily it looks like a P23 day for Ron And what we'd primarily like to do is spend a good part of that time getting the spacecraft cleaned up, reshuffled, restowed a little bit, and get it in order for the next few days ahead. It doesn't look like today's that big of a day.|||CC|Okay. Geno, I might give you some words on what we have in mind to get the GET back in sync here, if - if you want to hear those while you're looking through the upcoming hours.|||CDR|Yes, why don't you - why don't you pass a few words on that?||||||||Tape 13/3|||CC|Okay. The plan we're considering, and we're offering it to you now for your opinion, is at 65 hours GET, we'll update, and at the time the clock goes to 65, we'll update it 2 hours and 40 minutes to 67:40. And we're shaping your trajectory such that you'll arrive at the Moon at the same time G.m.t. as you would have had you launched on time. In other words, your translunar time is 2 hours and 40 minutes less. So once we do that, we'll be back with all the right times in the Flight Plan without any updating. And the one thing we think of is that your next day will, which is now a 16-hour day, will shorten to a 13-hour and 20-minute day-. But that's about the only real effect we can see. How does that sound?|||CDR|Yes, we - we'll get to the Moon, you say, the same G.m.t., so all our sunrise, sunset, lunar-orbit activities, and Sun angle at landing will be the same. And let me - I'll - It sounds pretty good, Gordo. I just want to take a look at that day that you're shortening and see what we're doing in there.|||CC|Okay. It doesn't cut out anything. In fact, we picked a time that's pretty much dead time as far as the Flight Plan goes. Take a look, and we'll talk about it later.|||CDR|Okay.|||LMP|Good morning, Gordy. This is Jack.|||CC|Good morning, Jack.|||LMP|Let me fill my square on the postsleep checklist. I've got 24030, PRD.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|And I slept in and out - probably totaled about 4 hours in that last period. But I feel pretty good in spite of that, and expect now that I've educated myself on how to sleep, that it'll pick up the next time around.||||||Tape 13/4|||||CC|Roger.|||LMP|No medication yet, but I'm considering a couple of aspirin. I'll let you know if I take them.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|And, fluids? Let's see, I guess I've had two of your little water-measurement-containers-full so far, plus the meal I had in my pocket. And I'll catch up on - I think I'm a little dehydrated. I'll catch up on fluids with breakfast.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|And my meal yesterday was the meal B in the pocket.|||CC|Roger. Meal B.|||LMP|And I guess consumables update. That's mainly yours.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|There's plenty there. And I'll wait for your words on that. And the watch is wound.|||CC|Roger. Okay. Got the consumables update numbers, if you're ready to copy.|||LMP|Not quite, Gordy. I'll give you a buzz.|||CC|Okay. N o hurry.||00 15 22 40|LMP|Okay. The CMPs rad's, 1509|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|15019. 15019.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. How do you want to send the consumable - consumables information?||||||||Tape 13/5|||CC|We were just discussing that here. Used to - in flights gone by, there was a place in the Flight Plan, a little form to fill out. But we're trying to figure out if there is such a place in the current data file. Do you know of one?|||LMP|Well, I'll tell you what I've got. I've got the consumables curves, and if there are any major changes to those curves, I guess you could give them to me, and I'll put them on as points.|||CC|There's no - -|||CDR|Hey, Jack.|||CC|- - changes at all.|||LMP|Okay. And why don't we just do it that way in the future in case there is anything. And that's on page 1-45 and subsequent in the Flight Plan Supplement.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Looks like you took good care of my space - my systems last night.|||CC|No troubles at all.||00 15 31 05|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Your friendly medical officer up here has some more information for you. CMP, continuing, had about 3 hours of sleep, had - three cans of fluid - of water, that is. And he ate everything In meal B but the fruitcake, and he didn't use the brownies and the beverage in meal C.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Okay. And continuing, the CDRs PD - PRD is 17019. He had 3 hours of fair sleep, no medication, and 1-1/2 cans of water, and one-half a sandwich. The CMPs sleep was 3 hours. And I'll try to get more systematic as we go along here.|||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 13/6|||||CC|Jack, we are assuming no - no medication on the CMP. Is that right?|||LMP|That's affirm. We haven't gotten that kit out yet|||CC|Okay.||00 16 00 33|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. Looks like the windows have cleared up pretty well in PTC from the - ice crystals, anyway, that were on window - window 1. The hatch window still seems to have a film of something on it. But, otherwise, they look pretty good.|||CC|Okay, sounds good. Jack, while you're there, I might try - we've been talking about consumable updates and what would be the most meaningful way to give you the information. As a trial, for 14 hours, with reference to the charts in the back of the book, which in the case of - in case of all of them, are listed in percentages except the RCS, which is in pounds. On the cryo quantities, when I take all the tank percentages and plot them, it turns out that there's no real significant difference from the lines that are plotted on either hydrogen or oxygen. On RCS, you're running about 3 percent ahead of the line. And if that's a satisfactory way to put it, that's the way we'll give you the - the updates rather than giving you every tank percent by percent. Over.|||LMP|Okay, that's good. That's outstanding.||00 16 12 20|LMP|MARK. Two aspirin for the LMP.|||CC|Roger, LMP.|||CC|Jack, next time the Surgeon would like a mark on each individual aspirin.|||LMP|Well, I gave it to you since I swallowed them both simultaneously.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 13/7|||LMP|I knew they wanted that, Gordy, and that's why I only gave you one.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Would they rather have them go down one at a time?||00 16 14 06|CC|I'11 have to go back to the backroom on that.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 14/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||00 16 44 52|CC|17, Houston. We see the optics starting to stir||||there. You can go ahead with a P52, but before you do the P23, we have some updates to it.|||CMP|Hey, okay, Gordo. We'll do that.|||CC|17, Houston. Can you confirm that you did change the LiOH canister before going to sleep last night?|||CMP|Well, we can confirm that we didn't. How about that?|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|We'll - Thanks - thanks for reminding us. We'll try that first thing this morning. I was just getting too tired, and the CO^ didn't look quite that high last night, so I - -|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|- - I let it go.|||CC|Okay, that's - that's fine. We're not concerned about being late with it.||00 16 46 22|CMP|Okay.||00 16 53 15|CMP|Okay, Houston. That looks like a pretty good one that time. You note the star angle difference?|||CC|Roger. We copy.|||CMP|Okay (chuckle). I can't see squat out through that telescope. I just hope it lines it up and does the right thing. Okay. Those are the torquing angles, and you can let me know when you have them.|||CC|Okay. Stand by.||||||Tape 14/2|||||CMP|The telescope is no different than any other time. There is just a lot of reflection from the lunar module. And even though everybody said that before, you don't quite believe it until you see it yourself.|||CC|Okay, Ron. You're clear to torque it.|||CMP|Okay. We'll torque it at 54 30.|||CC|Okay.||00 16 55 35|CC|17, Houston. When you - if you can find a stenographer, I got some dictation, some pads for you and also a Flight Plan update.|||CMP|Stand by 1, Gordon.||00 16 57 49|LMP|Okay, Gordy.|||CMP|P37.|||LMP|Oh, okay. Stand by. Okay, Ron's ready to copy.|||CMP|P37 pad's first.|||CC|Okay. Okay, the P37 block data for 35 hours. Well, we've got 35, 45, 55, 65. GET ignition of 035:00. DELTA-Vt is 5326, minus 175, 081:39. For a GET of 045:00, 7728, minus 177, 08l:l8. For a GET of 055:00, 5859, minus 175, 105:30. GET of 065:00, 4703, minus 175, 129:40.|||CMP|Okay, I'll read that. Let's see, 35:00 at 532o, minus 175, and 81:39 At 45:00, 7728, minus 177, and 8l:l8. At 55:00, it's 5859, minus 175, 105:30. At 65:00, it's 4703, minus 175, and 129:40.|||CC|Okay, that's correct. I've got a maneuver pad for you. It's a flyby maneuver at a time of 8l hours, which is 5 hours prior to L0I, This is required because you're presently on an impacting trajectory. And this is assuming you wouldn't do midcourse 2. Midcourse 2 will put you on a - on the proper trajectory. If you can get a maneuver pad out, I'll give it to you.||||||||Tape 14/3|||LMP|Okay. That's in work.||00 17 02 23|CMP|Okay, Houston. This is 17. Ready for the flyby pad.|||CC|Okay, Ron. We were just watching your roll angle. You're going to - we're going to be updating the optics cal attitude. And the roll will be lo4, and you're coming up on that. Maybe you want to stop the PTC near that roll angle.|||CMP|Hey, that's a good idea.|||LMP|Gordy ...|||LMP|Gordy, did you read Jack?|||CC|Loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|I can take the pad, if you want to while Ron stops PTC.|||CC|Okay. Why don't I give you the update to the Flight Plan, since that'll give you the new attitude and also the - change in the star for the P23. And then Ron can get on with that. The pad we can get after that.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay. Turn to 17 hours in the Flight Plan, page l8.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|"Okay. The ""VERB 49 maneuver to optics cal attitude"" right at the top of the page. Cross out the attitude numbers and replace them with ""Roll l64, pitch 301, and yaw 348 at a high-gain pitch angle of minus 48 and a yaw of 315."" Over."|||LMP|Okay; 164, 301, 348, minus 48, and 315|||CC|"That's correct. Now go down a few lines to the sighting attitude at - one's at 17 hours and 15 minutes. And cross out that attitude and the high-gain pitch angle and change to a ""Roll of 196, pitch 304, and yaw 348."" High-gain pitch is minus 6l, and the yaw remains the same, 357. Over."||||||Tape 14/4|||||LMP|Okay, 196, 304, 348, minus 6l.|||CC|That's correct. And now, on the first star of P23, we're going to change the star, so cross out - replace the NOUN 70 numbers with star 21. That would be three balls 21. And delete the NOUN 88 and the vector numbers there.||00 17 06 25|LMP|Okay, start 21 and no NOUN 88s.|||CC|"Right. And over on the right where it says ""Merak,"" you can write in ""Alphard."" That's what 21 is."|||LMP|Okay.|||CC|"Okay. Now down on the next pate, at 18 hours 20 minutes, where it says ""Optics calibration attitude."" We got to put in the same thing as -the same change as above. We want, instead of ""175, 298, 330,"" change that to ""l64, 301, and 348. High gain of minus 48 and 315.""

Southern California looks like it's in pretty good shape today, but northern California looks like it's probably overcast. And a major system probably associated with that that stretches into the northern western United States. But a band of clear weather looks like it stretches from Arizona right on up through, I would guess it - through Colorado and Kansas and probably into the Midwest pretty well.|||CC|Roger. You're a regular human weather satellite.|||LMP|If Ron would just stop his maneuvers I'd tell you some more, but the Earth just set behind the LM.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|More specifically, it set behind the Rover, which may be a space first.

As a matter of fact, we have a little bit made up here. I guess along the personal line, we checked with Barbara and Jan and the kids, and they're all back home safe and sound and they mentioned that they're going into their own personal quarantine period, glued to the squawk box. Over.|||CDR|Okay.|||CMP|I was afraid you were going to get too personal there, for a minute. (Laughter)|||CC|I'll run down a few quick summaries of this morning's news. Former President Harry Truman has rallied slightly, despite his weakened heart and labored breathing. His doctors report that their main worry is whether his heart is strong enough to withstand the strain, the physical strain of 88 years. Despite the slight rally, Truman's condition is still considered critical. In Paris, Henry Kissinger met with Hanoi's Le Due Tho for 4 hours yesterday in planned secret talks. Paris newspapers report an imminent cease-fire, but neither Kissinger or Tho indicate that this is true. After the 4-hour talks, Kissinger shook hands; and ... - got a little typo error here -but neither representative made any comment concerning their meeting. At Camp David, Maryland, President Nixon's press secretary, Ron L. Ziegler, said that Kissinger and Nixon are in close communication by cable concerning the secret peace talks. But Ziegler declined to provide more||||||Tape 15/2||||||"information about progress in the talks. President Nixon selected Claude S. Brinegar, a California oil executive and a doctor of economics, to be Secretary of Transportation succeeding John A. Volpe. Volpe will become the U.S. ambassador to Italy. Here's one concerning last night's launch. Mrs. Spiro Agnew reportedly made a wish on a falling star just before the delayed launch of Apollo 17-Sitting beside her at the VIP viewing site was Barbara Cernan, who said that she was nervous when the lift-off was postponed. She added, ""But A1 Bean was there with me. He said not to be concerned."" Mrs. Cernan was accompanied by her daughter, Tracy, and her mother, Mrs. Jackie Ashley. Mrs. Ron Evans, who saw the launch with her children, Jamie and John, said that she was never worried because everybody knew what they were doing."|||SC|(Laughter)||00 18 07 36|CDR|Good summary, Gordo. We thank you, and our best wishes for the return to health of Mr. Truman.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Gordo, we were figuring up here that we probably launched on the 6th of December in Houston and on the 7th of December in Florida.|||CC|That's right.

I wish everybody could have a chance to get that impression. Things might go a little easier for us.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|Okay, Gene, ... CMC FREE?|||CMP|(Singing) ... must be making the vector worse and worse instead of better. (Laughter) Well, it was on the substellar point that time except it was halfway through the Earth almost. Not really.||00 18 12 41|CMP|Hey, Gordy, we haven't really had a clear and detailed description of what you or somebody else saw at the launch, in terms of the lighting around the countryside, the state of the flame, and how long the - exhaust was under the S-IC. Do you have anything to add to that?|||CC|Well, I can give you my feelings, anyway. It was a spectacular sight, and no doubt about it. I'd say the level of illumination would have made it easy to - to read a newspaper or anything like that from my vantage point near the VAB. The -the plume itself actually looked no larger or - or even any brighter, really, except in contrast, than it does on a day launch by comparison. But -well, the effect, I guess, was about what I expected just trying to extrapolate previous launches into a nighttime situation. The weather was very clear. That was one advantage gained by delaying the launch the 2 hours and 40 minutes that you did. By that time, there were very few clouds around at all. And we could see a brilliant flash there when the first stage cut off and the second stage ignited. And I lost you visually probably, oh, 4 to 5 minutes into the second stage, as best I can remember. Part of the problem was the brightness of the plume during the first stage, it kind of burned a spot on my eye; and so then I was -had reduced efficiency at looking for a small||||||Tape 15/4||||||point of light from there on out. Stu's here with me and he was watching it, too. I'll see if he has anything to add.|||CMP|Stu who?|||CC|He said after that comment he has no comment.||00 18 15 26|CMP|"(Laughter) I'm sorry, Stu."" I can't believe that; Stu always has something to add. (Singing) Houston, in case you just noticed, I forgot the VERB 67 until just now. Although, in reality, all we're trying to do here is get a DELTA-H measurement anyhow. And, Houston, do you have any feel yet for what the DELTA-H is - line has been?"||00 18 16 14|CC|Stand by, Ron.|||sc||||CC|Ron, this is Houston. We're not going to be able to give you a handle on the DELTA-H until we have a chance to take all the data and reduce it and work it around a little.|||CMP|Okay, that's mighty fine.|||CMP|Okay, Geno, CMC AUTO?

Put the ... line of sight mark on star 22. Also the optics line of sight, with optics zero. Let's see, I'll the optics, I guess first.||00 18 45 43|CMP|Okay, Houston, looks like optics calibration here is 89 995- I get that half the time and 997 the rest. So (laughter) we'll use 995, I guess.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Okay, Houston, you ready for some purges and dumps?|||CC|Let me make sure here. We're standing by.|||LMP|Okay. I'll get going on the 0 purges on the fuel cell.|||CC|Okay.||00 18 49 28|LMP|Well, I had my clock on the wrong scale.

How are you?|||CC|Okay; swinging.|||LMP|That's good to hear.||||||Tape 15/6|||||CC|Sure am enjoying your descriptions.|||LMP|Well, if I could get Ron off his - work with the optics, we'd look at the Earth some more. But that will come. Right now I'm seeing all sorts of little ice crystals of various composition, (laughter) that are moving around, and every one of them bounces off the LM that I can see. No, none of them stick. I noticed that some of them will go into a corner with a fairly high velocity and either be turned around by a double bounce, or just get lodged in the corner and have very low velocity when they come out.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Most of them look like they have at least a foot or 2 per second.|||CC|Roger.|||CC|Hey, Jack, I was surprised when you said when you got Ron off the optics. Don't tell me that Ron is going to let you look through his optics.|||LMP|Oh, heavens no! We just move the windows. (Laughter)|||CC|(Laughter) Okay.||00 18 52 02|CMP|That's for sure.|||LMP|Stu, apparently you get - do get some particle/ particle collisions, because some of the trajectories are back towards us.|||CC|Okay; we're waiting for the explanation of that.|||LMP|Well, I think it's because the particles and -some of them, you know, are bouncing off the LM and get out into the stream, which normally would have no collisions. How's that? You can say it's not very good. I don't care.||00 18 53 20|CC|Got to use tact here.||00 18 55 40|CC|You can terminate the purge on fuel cell 3 - O2.||||||||Tape 15/7|||CMP|Yes.

They're damped adequately. We're ready for spinup.|||CDR|Okay, Bob.||00 19 54 23|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We're in PTC. Or, Bob, I guess you're down there now.|||CC|Roger, Gene.||00 19 55 20|LMP|Bob, did you ever find out what part of Antarctica we were seeing at various Earth orientations?|||CC|Jack, I've - I tried that this afternoon, and I couldn't get hold of anybody, and I looked on a map for a while, and I - I'm not sure where Little America was. I can't truthfully say I did it - get it. I'll keep looking at it.|||LMP|Okay. I - at any rate, it looks like there's a very well-developed front coming out of the northwestern portion of Antarctic ice shelf. And -and it - let's see here. Well, stand by 1.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Have to change windows.||00 19 58 25|LMP|Okay, Bob. That front looks like it starts and develops as a small - it - it actually seems to start with an anticyclone development off the coast of Antarctica. Moves up across New Zealand. Looks like the South Island primarily, a little bit of the North Island is still visible and into the eastern coast of Australia. And I'll give you a spot where it intersects and crosses the whole of Australia. However, it - it breaks up and is not very well formed, once it gets inland away from the coast. I see no well-developed waves on it at this time, so it's hard to say how strong it is. There might be one developing just to the south of New Zealand or right off the coast of New Zealand.||||||Tape 16/2|||||CC|Roger. I copy that, Jack.|||LMP|There at least is some sinusoidal motion or appearance to the front ... And you'll have to wait, because I lost it again.|||CC|Roger.||00 20 00 05|LMP|I took two 5 - 50-millimeter pictures. Mag November November is on 132.|||CC|Roger. November November on 132. Those are pictures of the - -|||LMP|And that was the -|||CC|Jack, Houston. Was that - were those pictures of those fronts you are talking about?||00 20 02 59|LMP|Bob, I got our orbital map out now, and that front is going off across to the coast of Australia north of Sidney and largely a little south of Brisbane and - and swings across the whole of Australia and seems to come - near as I can tell, go by into the Indian Ocean about - well, where the Great Sandy Desert intersects the northwestern coast of Australia.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||00 20 07 02|CC|17, I've got a Flight Plan update here.|||LMP|Stand by, please.|||CC|Roger. It's just a short one. One item to change.|||LMP|Well, if you saw my hands right now (laughter), you'd know why I said wait 1.|||CC|Understand. I'm Just - just waiting for your call. Just didn't want you to think we're going to give you a whole rafter of it.|||LMP|Oh, we know you wouldn't do that.||||||||Tape 16/3|||CC|If you're eating, Jack, just go ahead and eat. This is nothing that can - we can just wait, and any time, just go ahead.|||LMP|Yes, I'm not panicking.||00 20 09 00|LMP|Okay, Bob. Go with the update, and LM/CM DELTA-P at 20 ... 09.|||CC|Want you to know, Jack, we just cut out by the antenna switching. Say again the LM/CM DELTA-P.|||LMP|Okay, 0.6 at 20 plus 09.|||CC|"Roger. Okay. My update is just simply on the botton of page 3-23 at 2300 hours in the Flight Plan or 23 hours in the Flight Plan. ""WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve, CLOSED."" Just delete that one, and move it over to 24:30, That's because you got started late on that."|||LMP|Okay. You could've just said, move it.|||CC|Okay. Just change it down to 24:30.|||LMP|24:30.||00 20 11 48|LMP|Okay. Bob - about revision one on my previous discussion of the weather around Australia. That front does cross. Probably Brisbane is probably cloudy. It does cross about that area, and - however, there is a bank of clouds that runs off of it down the coastline. So Sidney is either cloudy or has some pretty nice clouds off - off shore. And the remnants of the front as it dissipates in the hinterland of Australia dies out at about the Great Sandy Desert, and there is not a good indication that it crosses into the Ind - Indian Ocean. But we're getting over near the LM, and that's a little hard to tell.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Now, it - more - looks more and more like the cyclone circulation developing right over the top of New Zealand; the South Island, I think. And now I'm looking with the binoc, and as much at||||||Tape 16/4||||||anticyclone circulation is centered on the ice shelf. And I think that - well, I Just don't know. I think that's the Ross Ice Shelf, but I'm not sure, off Antarctic. And the clouds from that circulation do extend over the ice shelf and barely into the Antarctic con - continent.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||00 20 13 46|LMP|Now to the north of Antarctica. Let's see now. I ought to give you a better orientation than that. But, anyway, there is a large cyclone circulation pattern that has its southern extremity right on the edge of the ice shelf. And that - that is east by 20 or 30 degrees of longitude of the front that I just was discussing. By the way, that front intersects Antarctica.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||00 20 16 21|LMP|Between New Zealand and Australia, the front I was discussing previously has some fairly strong transverse cloud patterns. It's hard to say whether they're high cirrus or not. But the clear area to the south of the front suggests that maybe the jet stream is roughly paralleling that front in that area.|||CC|Roger. I'd have to look up and see - -|||LMP|If I had to guess, I'd -|||CC|- - if they do have any jet stream down there right now.|||LMP|I - if I had to guess, if you were flying - west from Sidney this afternoon, you'd have a pretty strong tailwind behind you, Bob.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Let's see, did I get that right?|||LMP|Would you believe a headwind?|||CC|Okay. I'll believe that.||||||||Tape 16/5|||LMP|But the bulk of Australia is very clear, all the south and the north. It's just that one line of -of clouds that crosses the center section.|||CC|Roger.||00 20 18 45|LMP|That put all the major cities of the south, Perth and Adelaide, at least, and Melbourne, certainly in the clear. And in the North Darwin, in those areas, are very nicely clear today.|||CC|Roger. I hope we can get this out to them and let them know that you're watching and tell them how good the weather is.|||LMP|Oh, that's all right. I'm just having fun, Bob,|||CC|Understand. I imagine they'd appreciate it though.||00 20 34 06|LMP|Bob, I tried to pick out the Hawaiian Islands on that last little turn here through window 5. And I can't say that I did. I think I've got them -the area spotted. It looks like they might be under some fairly heavy cloud cover today. I do not see the islands. I'm not sure I could, if it was clear.|||CC|Roger. Hey, Jack, I got some answers to your question from last night on where Little America is with respect to - on Antarctica.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|There's a - inden - indentation that looks like a gulf that's called the Ross Sea, and on the northwest edge of the Ross Sea is Little America, That's the location of it.|||LMP|Okay. And that would be the coast of Antarctica that sort of faces New Zealand and Australia. Is that correct?|||CC|Negative. According to the map I've got, it's -the Ross Sea looks like it would be more facing up towards the South America area. It's actually kind of facing up sort of the middle between Australia and South America, Jack.||||||Tape 16/6|||||LMP|Okay, Bob. You cut out, and I presume you meant that - the Ross Sea was facing north - sort of the Pacific between South America and Australia?|||CC|That's affirmative, Jack. It's a very sharp indentation or sea or gulf onto the Antarctic.|||LMP|Okay. I think I know the area you mean, and I'll check it out again when it comes by.|||CC|Okay. That's Little America on that west-northwest edge of that Ross Sea. That's where Little America is.|||LMP|Yes, all that - those names are familiar. I just had forgotten my geography. I'll see if I can recognize them.||00 20 50 13|LMP|Okay, Bob, checking on the Ross Sea, and if I've got her pegged right, it's got a fair amount of open water in it this time of year.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Although it's completely surrounded, I think, completely surrounded, I think by portions of the icepack. And off to the west of there, it looks like there's an area that might be - clear of snow, and - does my memory serve me correctly, that that's where McMurdo Sound is, and some of the dry valleys?|||CC|I believe so. That's the Little America area right now, all that general vicinity, Jack.|||LMP|Okay. It looks like the prime recovery area and the Samoa Island region is clear, and my guess would be from the fairly subdued zero phase point, that they might have fairly nice seas out there. The boys on the Ticonderoga are probably enjoying themselves immensely, I hope.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 16/7|||LMP|Indonesia looks like it's having a nice day, with the possible exception of the region over just north of Australia. New Guinea and that area they - some clouds in there. I can't tell whether they are high or low clouds though. They look like they're probably fairly high clouds. But north of New Guinea, there's a strong concentration of clouds. Although small, it looks fairly dense like there might be a little tropical depression in that area.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|The folks in Carnarvon ought to be enjoying a very nice day.||00 20 53 31|LMP|I've been trying to spot tropical storm Teresa, which is - a couple of days ago was in the Philippines. But I can't - I don't think I quite have that visible to me right now.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Say, you might want to put something in the back of your mind here a minute. We made a run of the DSE recording just now of the TLI to get an idea of the quality of the DSE recording, and Gene came through loud and clear. Ron was very weak and almost unreadable, and we never caught you, Jack, in there. We don't - maybe you weren't saying anything during TLI, but we never did catch anything you said.|||LMP|Okay. I don't recall talking too much during TLI.|||CC|Roger. Understand. Now Gene - Gene came through real loud and clear. So whatever technique he was using went on that tape real well.||00 20 55 48|CC|Hey, Jack; Houston.|||LMP|Hello.|||CC|Hey, Jack. Just a couple more comments on that DSE. I think, as you well know, it's very critical on the position of your - of your boom there, and those areas that you're critical in, why, make sure that you've - you've really got those beauties up or you're talking right in - right into it. And||||||Tape 16/8||||||this - this really makes a difference, because the DSE - The volume is - is fairly low, and if you're muddled just the least bit, why, it - it's going to be difficult to pick it up. So talk slow, and - and get right up next to the mike, because I know you - you're doing it. Just some voices come across a little better than others.|||LMP|Roger, Stu. Thanks for the comments. As a matter of fact, you probably called it just right. I think during - once I got the helmet off, I lessened up my chinstrap, and my mike booms had moved away from my mouth some. And I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the reminder.|||CC|Yes. It's - that's probably the most critical item is that - is the position of those, and this has been true of - in the past, and it just really makes a difference in - in that - being able to pick up the data off the voice.|||LMP|Roger. I've - Ron and I did some experimentation with that in the chamber, and couldn't agree more. But I sometimes don't remember it. Thank you.|||CDR|Well, Stu, I just - -|||LMP|I - I |||CDR|- - thought I'd -|||LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Stu.|||CC|No, I was saying I was - I'm sure you - you're aware of that, but I think the fact that the volume is - is down just accentuates the - the problem.|||LMP|Okay. Gene had something he wanted to ask you.|||CDR|Stu, I - I just thought you'd like to be aware of it, as much time as we've all spent down at the cape, probably May is one of the nicest months down there. However, having had the opportunity to - to be up here during May, I find out that it's not nearly as nice up here.||||||||Tape 16/9|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|And I'd like to - to thank all my friends for that||oo 20 58 04|CC|Okay.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 17/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||00 21 10 24|LMP|Bob, you with me?|||CC|Roger. We wouldn't go away, Jack. We're listening. Did you call?|||LMP|Well, I just - Yes, I almost lost a pass here, and just a couple more words about Australia. As a -as a general landmass, it's red. Very strong red hues, except for the north and eastern coasts, where that red gradually merges into a greenish-gray. It's as - as red as portions of - of northern Africa appeared to be yesterday.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Very striking color. It would be more of an orange-red, really, with brown subduing it. It's not -obviously not crimson or anything like that.|||CC|You think it's a function of Sun angle, Jack, or is it just - just a red like we see out in New Mexico area sometimes - some of the areas?|||LMP|Yes. No, it's not Sun angle, because that'll hold a good red color right - right in towards sunset or sunrise. It's - it's due primarily, I'm sure, like most desert areas, to the oxidation of the iron-bearing minerals in the sands and rocks in those regions.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Getting limonite and hematite. Little geology thrown in there , Bob. Sorry.|||CC|That's all right. Got to keep you warmed up for the next couple of days.|||LMP|Well, I think the Flight Plan will probably keep me warmed up, too.|||CC|Roger. We thought that time around T&D was juut outstanding.||||||Tape 17/2|||||CDR|Hey, Bob. We - I think we've pretty well got impressions from you down there on that - on that night launch. I might give you a few of mine.|||CC|Go ahead, Gene.||00 21 13 40|CC|17, Houston. Are you there? You're right on the edge, if you read me. We're getting a lot - You're right on the edge, if you read me. We're getting a lot of static. If you'll just hang on a minute, we'll be back into some calm air.|||CC|Gene, Houston. Go ahead.||00 21 14 54|CC|17, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|We're just standing by for your comments you wanted to make. I think we lost comm there a minute. We're back with you.||00 21 15 05|CDR|"Okay, Bob. The entire boost itself was not unlike what you've heard and what Stu down there understands from the physical cues, and what have you. But the significant part of going at night is that as soon as we did have ignition down there in the bottom of the S-IC stack - even though I only have a little slit out of - out of the rendezvous window here, and Ron doesn't have much of a hole in the boost protective cover out of the hatch window, we could definitely confirm ignition because we could see the reflected light on out through in front of us. It was by no means blinding, of course; we had the cockpit pretty well lit up. We - as soon as we lifted off, that light immediately went behind us We came into just S-IC staging, and I had an opportunity to say, ""I told you so,"" to Jack and Ron. It was just like the great train wrecks of the past. I definitely could see the S-II ignite; and, then, of course, the - I could see the significance of the reflection through the window, besides all the other cues we had for ignition, very much like the S-IC lit up the windows on the stack. Tower jett was pretty spectacular. I could see - the entire boost protective cover and some flames from somewhere -I'm not sure - maybe it was through the hole in"||||||||Tape 17/3||||the windows - but I could definitely see it. Of course, it disappeared in short order. When the S-II shut down, the delay time between shutdown there and the S-IVB igniting, the entire - the entire flame overtook us, and we literally through -flew through the S-II flame when the S-IVB ignited, if you can imagine that. It's very similar to the Titan staging, where you actually fly through tne fireball on the S-II. And that's something you never see - none of those things you ever see quite that way in daylight. On the S-IV, I could see -Of course, once we got going, I couldn't see any light from that plume again, but we could see the APS firing all the way through the burn. And once we got in orbit, as other guys have seen, you could see the APS firing at night without any difficulty. One of the most significant things about TLI is the fact that we, of course, started at night and flew right on up and through a sunrise, which in itself was a pretty spectacular thing. But, when you do it during a TLI burn, it even adds a little bit of momentum to your effort.||00 21 18 25|CC|Roger, Gene. Any comment you might make on the possibility of picking up your yaw, if you'd lost your platform at that time - remember the discussion we had about the yaw in the late - like a Mode IV or something like that?|||CDR|Yes, Bob. I not only will comment - I was aware of it, and I was looking for it. And during parts of the S-II and parts of the S-IVB burn, I even turned the lights down in the cockpit - in hopes that I could see stars out there; but I could not make out a one. Ron, I think, may have saw Saturn out the overhead hatch; but looking through the rendezvous window, during a boost phase and during a time-critical phase like a Mode II or Mode IV, I am very much afraid that we would not have been able to pick up that reference.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|As I remember it, as low as I had the interior lights there for a period of time - and I didn't want to keep them that low, of course - to see if I could get adapted very fast because we were||||||Tape 17/4||||||in a dynamic phase of the burn. But my window just gave me a very deep purplish hue, a hue of which I could not, literally, see through to look to see any stars at all. Now, that may have been due to the very low intensity of our interior flood lights.||00 21 19 53|CC|Roger, Gene.|||LMP|"Bob, this is Jack. A little lay impression there. I think I - saw just about everything Gene was talking about - as far as his description - and felt like it was - although everything was an amazing experience, each one in itself, after each one was over, you could think back and say, ""Yes, that's what other guys said it was like."" The old Saturn V has got to be a pretty consistently performing vehicle. But - with the added night-time contrast, I think it made it probably the best ride any three guys have ever had."|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Bob, I might add, that the S-I was, as usual, pretty shakey on lift-off. I saw all the maneuvers as I called them out - the yaw and small reverse roll. Going through max q, I got up to 25 percent; but my yaw attitude error was zero and my pitch attitude error probably wasn't even at -oh, certainly less than 2 degrees. After max q, she smoothed out by comparison quite a bit ; and the S-II was a very quiet ride, a very smooth ride. However, you are always aware, due to just a little rumbling out in the S-IVB, that she was still burning for you. The S-IVB, I think, was just a continually - rumble but smooth or consistent ride, all the way through TLI.|||CC|Roger.||00 21 22 06|LMP|Gee! I think one of the big things that impressed me was the - how instantaneous the decelerations were of each one of the boosters when they cut off. That included the S-IV TLI cut-off. No physical appreciation of tailoff at all.|||LMP|And, Bob, from my rendez - from the right-hand rendezvous window when the tower jett occurred, there seemed to be a lot of burning particles||||||||Tape 17/5||||streaming away from it. I could not see - did not notice or remember seeing the actual cover or tower itself; but I - we were inside the cone of the burn and with a lot of streaming. It looked very much like a sky rocket - portion of one at any rate. Reminded me of the Fourth of July out in Silver City a few years ago.|||CC|Roger. Say, any time you got your Flight Plan handy, I've got a discussion here I'd like to run through with you on the - how we're going to recover those 2 hours and 40 minutes from the launch delay - and you'll need to copy it into the Flight Plan. And then just wanted - want you to be advised, we're not happy with the PTC. We get a half angle of about 17 degrees; and so sometime after the P52 coming up at 23:00, we'll want to do another PTC, or initiate PTC again.||00 21 24 05|CDR|Well, that was the commander who initiated PTC, and I've already heard about that.|||CMP|(Laughter) You bet he has. Okay. We've got the Flight Plan here, Bob. Which part of it are you talking about ...?||00 21 24 17|CC|Well, let's just talk some words here for a minute, and then I'll go through some specifics that you can just write down on a page because you don't want to do it until a little later. Okay, what we're going to set up here - You will arrive at lunar orbit at the same GMT time. The landing Sun angle - Sun elevation angle - and the camera settings and everything will be unchanged when you get to lunar orbit. To compensate for the 2 hour 40 minute late launch, we're going to hack 2 hours and 40 minutes out of the timeline. And we're going to - They'll be out of the TLC timeline - and we're going to do it in two groups. And this is where you might want to start copying now, Ron. Delete 1 hour from 46 to 47. From 46 to 47, we're just going to delete the activities that are presently scheduled at 46:30 to 47:00, you'll perform at 45 - move those to 45. Let me read that again. Delete 1 hour from 46:00 to 47:00. The activities that are listed at 46:30 to 47 = 00, perform at 4rj:00.||||||Tape 17/6||||00 21 25 4l|CMP|Okay, Bob, looks like we delete 1 hour from 46 to 47 hours. And then the activities that are at 46:30, we'll do those at 45:00.|||CC|Roger, Ron. And then starting at 4 7, just take -just scratch 1 hour off of each time, just subtract 1 hour from each of those times up through 66 hours. Just subtract 1 hour from 47 up through 66.|||CMP|Okay, we can do that. Subtract 1 hour from 47 through 66 hours.|||CC|Okay. And then just for your information - you won't have to do it - but we're going to play the old simulator step-ahead game at 66 hours of the old time, which will be 65 hours of the new time. So however you want to call it, we'll call you; and we're going to sync you up at 67:40 at that point. We'll play the old step-ahead game there.||00 21 26 44|CDR|Okay, Bob. That means that you're not going to actually do any clock updates or syncs until -until somewhere in the 60's there and not in the 40's.|||CC|Roger. It'll be 65 hours of the new time or 66 hours under the old time; depends on how you want to look at it. But that's when we 111 sync you up.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|You'll be in sync all the way out to that time; just - we're just going to delete and jump you to 67:40.||00 21 27 17|SC|Okay.|||CC|And just another note of interest - You don't have to write this down - what - let's see; I'll read it to you. The awake periods will be - on day 3, you'll be 15 hours, 8 hours sleep starting at 11:33 CST; then at day 4, you'll be 14 and 20 hours, with 8 hours sleep. So - it actually just shortens a couple days there.||00 21 27 49|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine.||||||||Tape 17/7|||CC|The beauty of that - that Tommy came up with on that, Ron - is that all you have to do is go subtract those 1 hours and no more reading or anything else; just subtract them and we're in business.|||CMP|Yes, it looks real fine.|||CC|We're going to give Tommy a gold star for that one.||00 21 28 20|CMP|(Laughter) You bet.|||LMP|(Cough) Bob, this is Jack. I'm going to try and get a little exercise. I'd be interested to know how high I can get my heart rate just fooling around up here.||00 21 28 44|CC|Okay, if we can - We'll keep you posted, Jack.|||CDR|Bob, just to keep you and the people there thinking a little bit, today is a relatively short day; but it is a good day because it gives us a chance to again get acclimated finish our stowage and just generally go through all the things that have to be gone through for the rest of the mission. We've got 3 eating days today, and judging from what we're thinking and talking about now - that the last two are going to be sort of stretched into one eating period because three meals on this particular day just is not really going to be stomachable.|||CC|Roger. We understand that.|||SC|I think you'll find out that our eating and drinking, for the most part, is starting off relatively slow; but - I think we'll pick it up here by tomorrow.||00 21 30 24|CC|Roger.||00 21 33 18|CDR|Bob, one other thing while I'm thinking about it. The PU shifts were all noticeable, but probably the one that really caught me a little bit by surprise was the PU shift on the S-IVB during -during TLI.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 17/8|||||CDR|It just felt like you lit in the other burner.||00 21 33 4l|CC|Roger. Understand.|||CC|Just for Jack's information, you're running in the 80s on your heartbeat. We saw a 91 or 2 there for a few minutes. Are you working - still working out?|||LMP|(Laughter) Yes. That's sort of discouraging.|||CC|I'm sorry, babe (laughter).|||CDR|Hey, Bob, what was Jack running before he started that?|||CC|He was running in the 60s; the count's somewhere in the mid 60s.||00 21 34 40|CDR|Okay.||00 21 35 29|CC|Okay, Jack. You're running about 105 and 103 right now.|||CC|Kind of interesting, Jack. You slowed down, and then you're back up to 105 right now. Now you're slowing down again.||00 21 40 11|CDR|Hello, Houston; 17.|||CC|Go ahead, 17.|||CC|Go ahead, 17; this is Houston.|||CDR|Hello, Houston; this is 17.|||CC|Roger.

I'm reading you loud and clear, Honeysuckle. I'm not getting to him.||00 21 4l 36|CDR|Hello, Houston; this is America. Over.|||CC|America, Houston. Stand by. If you read us, don't change anything in the cockpit yet.|||CT|17, Honeysuckle.|||CT|Roger, Honeysuckle. I read you - -|||CMP|Hello, Honeysuckle. 17's reading you loud and clear.|||CT|Roger. We have a comm outage and I'll be right with you.|||CMP|Okay. Very fine. How are things down there today?|||CT|Fine. Your ...|||SC|... from here.||00 21 42 22|CC|Okay, 17; Houston. How do you read now?||00 21 42 28|CDR|We got you, Bob.|||CC|Okay. That was our network problem, not your problem on board.|||CDR|Okay thank you, I just figured out what happened on my PTC. Here - with his exercises, Jack is shaking all of America in all three axes, here.|||CC|Roger. He finally got to 115 on the heart rate.||00 21 42 52|LMP|Yes, my rate needles are bouncing back and forth a half a degree (laughter).|||CC|Roger. Got to find something to pin it on.||||||Tape 17/10||||00 21 44 48|CC|Jack. Surgeon over here says you got a 120 on the heartbeat for a moment there - 122 right now. Okay, 130, Jack. 130. 140 , Jack, l40.||00 21 47 18|CC|17, we've got a serious one here. You might be interested. All that exercise banging around in there has destratified tank 3 , so it stirred it all up good.|||LMP|Yes, glad we brought him along then. We found some use for him. Once an EEC0M, always an EEC0M. I have to ere - create my own g in order to run in place.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|How high up did the heart rate get, Bob?|||CC|We got you at l40, Jack. Were you running in place? Is that - -|||LMP|l40 was - Yes, I was - I'm underneath the right-hand couch holding on to the main Y-Y strut with my hands and running against the LEB.|||CC|Roger. It worked real well. l40 and you were running in the mid-60's, so you picked up about -almost 70 beats there, no problem. The surgeon is very happy.|||LMP|Roger. Well, I'm happy too. You know, it took a while to find a technique I was - initially, I got up to 90 with just isometrics - pushing against the couch, and the running is obviously what it takes .|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|But I don't - Bob, I don't I really don't feel -I guess I lost you.||00 21 51 33|LMP|Hello, Houston; 17. You still there?|||CC|Roger. We're with you. We had a little comm problem there as - you know, coning on this - as we were changing on the antenna - but we're with you.||||||||Tape 17/11|||LMP|Okay. What's the heartrate right now?|||CC|Right at - Stand by. We ha.d a data dropout, Jack, that's why I'm holding up. And it just came on and we'll tell you in a second here. About 60, Jack. Right about 60 even.|||LMP|Okay. That's where I was when I started, so that's - you certainly recover fast. I don't know whether that's faster than in one g or not.|||CC|Well, we're happy with it - the Surgeon is happy with it, so it's good.|||LMP|Well, I just - How does that compare - do they have any data on how that compares with the recovery - say, the 5-minute recovery time on the ergometer?|||CC|We can look it up, Jack, if you're interested. We - we'll have to check your records, they don't have it right in front of us.|||LMP|No big deal. I was just curious.||00 21 52 54|CC|Roger.||00 21 55 47|CC|Jack, just for your information - the Surgeons pulled out the recovery rate data and it's the same with our data, which is a little rough here. It's the same for zero g as your one-g ergometer data.|||LMP|Okay. That's very interesting.||00 21 56 12|CC|Roger.||00 21 59 43|LMP|Bob, since we've got a few moments to talk - which I know we won't have later in the mission. Something I don't ever remember happening, but it's happening now in the windows. That's the 1, 3 , and 5, but not 2 and 4, is that in the center of the window about 6 or 8 inches in diameter, as you come through the night side of the rotation, you pick up a very light - oh, you might call it even a frost. Very light frost on the window -more like a - a moisture frost, film of moisture,||||||Tape 17/12||||||or film of frost - not very thick like crystals at all. As you come through the sunlight, it tends to sublime away, but never - you never fully lose it until you go back into darkness again. The very artistic definite ice crystals that we had on my number 1 window over here yesterday - I think we reported to you this morning that they were gone or they sublimed away. But the impression they left on the window is still there; it's very sharp and very evident.||00 22 01 l4|CC|Roger. We copy that.||00 22 02 38|LMP|Bob, I don't know whether you were copying Honeysuckle's call to us, while you lost comm there for a while.|||CC|Roger. We copy.|||LMP|But they said that they had - -|||SC||||LMP|Okay.|||CC|They kind of concurred with your - -|||LMP|Okay - -|||CC|- - weather report there, Jack.|||LMP|Oh, lucky guess. I might say that the sub - the zero phase point that we're looking at is right at the northeast coast of Australia, and it's much brighter. Very - it's a very bright point now -oh, it's hard to say how far across. But, quite unlike what I mentioned being in the vicinity of the Samoan Islands earlier. And it's right at the shore, and it could be just that the shore area has somewhat choppier seas. So maybe - maybe the brightness of that point is a function of sea state, although I don't know exactly what type of seas it would take to brighten it up. I suspect choppy seas are better than long swells.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||||||||Tape 17/13||00 22 04 15|LMP|That front is - seems to have slowed down its progress . It's about in the same position, possibly slightly farther north than when I started talking about it this morning. The wave that has - seems to be developing off the - now off the southwest coast of New Zealand is much more pronounced than it was. Definitely seems to now have a slight cyclonic pattern - clockwise pattern. And I wouldn't be surprised if the next couple of days that moves along the front over towards Sydney. And maybe a little farther north than that might -Brisbane is probably more likely.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|Except I got the movement wrong again. Although it does seem to have progressed west from New Zealand.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I take back what I said about forecasting Sydney's weather. I think that will - I would suspect that would move to the northeast like - now that I look -it seems like an earlier front, which is partly dissipated, had the same kind of motion, and now lies considerably north and east of the one I've been talking about.|||CC|Roger.||00 22 06 46|LMP|Thinking back on some weather briefings we had last week, Bob - Are you there?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||LMP|I'll talk to you later. I think you're - We're losing you for a little bit here.|||CC|Okay, Jack. We're reading you loud and clear right now. Oh, you're going out a little bit now.||00 22 10 36|LMP|You back with us, Bob?|||CC|That's affirmative.||||||Tape 17/14|||||LMP|Okay, I was going to try to recover there from that last few statements. As I recall, the weather briefings that we had at the Cape last week, that -talking with Ken Nabor and Jim Nicholson down there, that the patterns we were seeing from the satellite pictures in their forecast - or analysis anyway, charts in the New Zealand part of the Pacific, those waves formed along the front would move north and then curve east. And that appears to be the pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. And I suspect if that pattern would hold with the wave that's developed off the coast - right on the coast of New Zealand now, that it might move on up the western coast of New Zealand. We'll probably have a chance to watch that the next few days and see what happens to it.||00 22 11 52|CC|Roger, Jack.||00 22 12 44|CDR|Houston, how are you reading now?|||CC|Reading you loud and clear.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. As I look at the clock, we're - just 24 hours ago we were about within our hold somewhere. For this period yesterday we were in our hold, and I think it goes without saying; but we'd sure like to pass on our bit of gratitude and thanks for the response that the people down at the Cape came up with. And particularly at Marshall. I think we all knew no one would be going anywhere unless everyone was satisfied that we were going all the way. And that's certainly the way we felt, but we do want to thank everybody who had a part in making that come true.|||CC|Roger, Gene. I think it was a superb show between the Cape and Marshall and Houston and probably even Goddard, with the Network and just about everybody concerned, really, had to do some work there to bring it off. And it went off real smoothly.|||CDR|Yes. After flying with Stafford a couple of times and having that happen a few times back, I thought maybe he was aboard.||||||||Tape 17/15|||CC|(Chuckle) Okay. I think that was a first for getting a Saturn V to 30 seconds before ignition and - or rather actually 30 seconds before liftoff and holding there.|||CDR|It got mighty quiet onboard about 30 seconds.|||CC|I sure imagine.|||LMP|We all felt like old hands the second time around, though.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Bob, I've been at that 30-second count one other time and it's no different the second time around.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|But we do appreciate the work, and I think it's typical of - of what made this manned space program such a superprogram. The response of people like that.|||CC|We concur with that, Gene, wholeheartedly.|||CDR|And with that in mind, tell everyone to stick around because there's a lot yet to be done.||00 22 15 24|CC|You better believe it.||00 22 20 28|LMP|The old accumulator cycle again, I guess, gang.|||CC|Roger. We're seeing it. It looks like you got a MASTER ALARM. Is that affirm?|||LMP|Yes, sir. That's how we tell these days. Although it doesn't happen all the time, and I guess as long as - Whenever we have that WASTE VENT, CLOSED, we probably wouldn't be bothered by it at night.|||CC|Roger. That's - that's our feelings here, Jack.||00 22 21 24|CC|Say, Gene and Ron, I talked to your fraus on the phone here a little while ago, and they gave me a very interesting observation you might appreciate. They were standing close to some water||||||Tape 17/l6||||||when launch and they noticed that when the booster lit up, something scared all the fish because the water literally began to boil with fish jumping from the light, I guess, or from the shock wave or something. It must have made a very distinct impression because that's the first thing both of them told me about.|||CMP|Yes, that's pretty neat.|||CC|A neat way to go scare up the fish, I guess.|||CMP|(Laughter) Right.|||CDR|How are they doing today, Bob?|||CC|Really fine, really fine. They're just - like I said, they're just really tickled pink, and Barbara said that she wants you to know she's going into quarantine until after the weekend here, until after landing.|||CDR|If she goes into quarantine, it'll be a space first|||CC|Roger.|||CC|You got to be careful - -|||CDR|Well, you know what to tell them - -|||CC|- - about all this.|||CDR|Go ahead, Bob.|||CC|You got to be careful now - The hotboxes are open -the hotlines are open at the houses there, so everything you say is being listened to.|||CDR|Yes; okay. In that case, just want to say hello and we're having a super good time looking forward to what's coming, and we thank you for the news, Robert.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|And my impression of the world, philosophically, I suppose you'll be getting from time to time, but it sure hasn't changed.||||||||Tape 17/17|||CC|Roger, Gene.|||CDR|It's sure beautiful. It's sure beautiful and, looking back at it, there's several billion people who have got a lot to work for because it's one of the most beautiful sights we've ever seen here.|||CC|Roger, Gene. You guys are sounding great and doing real great. We're pressing right on here.|||CDR|1    just want to emphasize, Bob, that these first 2    days - of course, yesterday was a pretty good day, but today we're catching up and - and, as I say, on the food consumption, don't be expecting too much.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Acclimation and familiarity, and stowage and preparation, and enjoyment and relaxation - are ready to call it a day today, which is probably the most ideal day in the Flight Plan to put it, because it's probably the only one we'll have.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Not that they aren't all going to be enjoyable.|||LMP|Hey, Bob, your hourly weather report is due and -(laughter) I'll wait awhile. I keep losing your comm.||00 22 25 14|CC|Okay.||00 22 26 06|LMP|Bob, you there?|||CC|Roger, Jack. We're standing by.|||LMP|Okay, I had a quick - quick look and just to bring you up to date, we're starting to be able to see the coast of Asia. The Philippines are wide open today. And the - that tropical storm Theresa that I mentioned I thought I could see - indeed, I'm sure that's what that little concentrated mass of clouds was north of New Guinea. And, I suspect, although I didn't get a good fix on it, that the folks in Guam may be in for some heavy weather.||||||Tape 17/18|||||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Oh, and, Bob, I got another pair of pictures. And that would be up to 134.|||CC|Roger. That's on November November, is that affirm?|||LMP|That's affirm.|||CC|Good. Good show.|||LMP|And that was taken - the last pass , about 10 minutes ago, if you want to keep track of GET.|||CC|Roger. Thanks, Jack; I'm doing that.|||CC|Just for some information for Ron, in particular. We've evaluated the data from the mapping camera and the pan camera cycling there and it looks real good. Everything looks right normal.||00 22 28 45|CMP|Hey, that's outstanding. Good deal.||00 22 35 01|LMP|Bob, how do you read 17?|||CC|17, read you 5 by.|||LMP|That's the strangest-sounding Bob I ever heard.|||CC|He's taking a short break.|||LMP|Okay. Good. Nice to talk with you. Hey, I don't know whether you were around, Gene, the other day when I was talking about the circulation patterns around Antarctica. We were looking then at the Indian Ocean - actually, South Atlantic in the Indian Ocean region. And you see the same pattern at about the same latitude, say 60 degrees south, where all the linear cloud patterns which presumably are - reflect the various cold fronts have -are arcuate with their convex sides , or more actually, almost pointed sides are all lined up in a west-to-east direction around that latitude. It's quite a spectacular appearing circulation pattern. And the little wave that I mentioned on New Zealand seems to be beginning to form another||||||||Tape 17/19||||arrow or another convex point on that front that's fitting right into the same circulation pattern.|||CC|Okay, copy.|||LMP|That would make four of those major convex fronts that I can see from this view crossing - south of Australia up into the South Pacific.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|On - on that tropical storm that was Theresa, I don't know whether they're still calling it now -that now, but I'm not sure it may be a little south of Guam. Guam may not be in trouble with that one.|||CC|It looks like it's just a bit to the west of Manila there - about 5 or 6 degrees, no more than that about. It looks like it's about 5 degrees west of Manila and about 5 degrees south. And it is still called Theresa.||00 22 39 54|LMP|Okay, Gene, if you're still there, I don't like to argue with you but I think our analysis chart is a little more up to date.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|That center - that area that you just mentioned is very clear now - east of the Philippines. Did you say west or east of the Philippines?|||CC|West of the Philippines.|||LMP|Okay, that a.rea that you mentioned, 5 degrees east, is very clear and the center of the - what appears ~o be the storm that I'm speaking of, would be about 142 longitude and maybe 8 degrees north latitude.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Which would put it south of Guam.|||CC|Okay, yes, you're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then.||||||Tape 17/20|||||LMP|Say again, Gene?|||CC|You're over in the area between Guam and the Carolines, then. You're saying it would be just about due west of the Carolines, then.|||LMP||||CC|Okay.||00 22 40 54|LMP|Yes , you're probably looking at a - oh, I don't know - maybe a what - a 12-hour old prog, or something?||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape l8/l|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||00 22 40 58|LMP|12-hour-old prog, or something.|||CC|Yes, that's the one I had for launch date.|||LMP|Okay. Well, it's - it's - moved quite a bit now, and I guess it's the same storm; still seems to be very well organized but quite concentrated and small.|||CC|Okay. I'll get a new prog in and compare your estimage there.||00 22 4l 30|LMP|Okay. I think that's pretty good - those - 142 and 8 degrees would be pretty good center of that storm. I've got some pretty good coor - I can see Mindanao, and I can see the - let's see -just a second - what is that on Australia?||0C 22 42 12|LMP|Yes, of course, that is Port Moresby. I can see that point there, and between those two - I can pin that one down probably within a couple of degrees.|||CC|Okay. We'll get a satellite photo and bring it in here in just a bit.||00 22 50 23|LMP|Houston, canister number 4 is in Bravo now.|||CC|Roger. We copy that.||00 22 56 36|LMP|Houston, 17|||CC|Go ahead, 17.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. That storm off the - just off the southwest coast of New Zealand is still intensifying and has both high and low level clouds as you can see by shadow lines. It looks like it may go into pretty - pretty fair storm system. Borneo is very clear today; and, as is the'Philippines . And as I mentioned, there's a - looks like a very strong frontal system that stretches||||||Tape 18/2||||||from, oh, let's say, the south coast of - or southeast coast of Vietnam up - up between and across Tai - between the Philippines and Taiwan and across Taiwan. And right along, and I can't tell I think, just off - just south of Japan. I can't tell whether Japan is in the front or not. I'll look at it some more. The strongest storm center that I can see on that is - is way north, and probably - Hokkaido is - has a fair amount of weather from that storm system. There seems to be a tropical depression just north of Borneo. A very strong circulation system north of Borneo and, I guess, just south of - of Vietnam.|||CC|Roger.||00 22 59 01|LMP|Probably south - probably southeast. I hadn't noticed it before, but it's extremely concentrated northern hemisphere cycl - cyclone pattern. I don't know whether that's on your prog or not. That's not what's left of Sally, is it?|||CC|Stand by. Let me look at the prog over here a sec. Okay. We - it doesn't show on the old one; the new one is coming in there shortly, Jack.|||LMP|Okay. If that is a developing depression, it's approaching Luzon and not very far away -2 or 3 degrees of longitude now, although Luzon is clear.|||CC|Roger.||00 23 00 02|LMP|I can see Korea quite well, Bob. It's clear today.|||CC|Yes, we - we've got the fronts. The leading edge of the front on our prog was past Korea and on Japan, and you've got it moving quite a bit further east there.|||LMP|Well, I'm not absolutely sure -||00 23 00 22|LMP|MASTER ALARM on the accumulator.|||CC|Roger. We copy.||||||||Tape 18/3||00 23 00 33|LMP|I can't make out Japan spe - specifically yet; but it's clearly past Korea, and, by - by inspection, it looks like it would be also past Japan by now, the trailing edge of the front. However, the circulation center on farther northeast may be affecting Hokkaido, as I said.|||CC|Roger. Like I said, the front on the old prog for yesterday showed that front on the other side of Japan, so it's moved across pretty well.||00 23 01 26|LMP|As I recall, they had a tropical storm called Sally that went into - ... a few days ago, and so I suspect this new one that seems - that I think I see between Borneo and Vietnam maybe something else; a new depression or I may be - be fooled by it.||00 23 02 16|LMP|Mainland China, Bob, was the last pass here. I can't see the Ear - see the Earth now, but Mainland China looked like it was clear as far as I could see. There might be another front quite a ways inland, but that gets right at the LM, and I can't tell. But Korea, Yellow Sea, and the regions of China south of there - Shanghai , Nanking and those places are - look as if they are quite clear today. I'll check that again next time around.||00 23 02 50|CC|Roger. And, Jack, we are ready to terminate the charge on BATTERY B and start the charge on BATTERY A.||00 23 03 04|LMP|Okay. That's in work.||00 23 04 23|LMP|Houston, for your information, system test 7A is about 0.6.|||CC|Say that again, Jack. I missed that. 0.6 on system test 7A?||00 23 04 36|LMP|That's affirm. Battery compartment pressure.|||CC|Thank you, J ack.||||||Tape 18/4||||00 23 05 13|LMP|Okay, Bob. BATTERY A is being charged now.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||00 23 07 02|LMP|Bob, you got any of the LMies in there today?|||CC|Any of your LMies? Roger. They're all sitting by. Just gave me a big thumbs up, Jack.|||LMP|Okay. Give them a thumbs up on the rendezvous radar antenna. It looks real good.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I'm nose-to-nose with it practically here at about 2 feet, and it's extremely clean. And I see absolutely no sign of any - anything abnormal with it.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Matter of fact, compared to some of the flaking problems and things like that we've heard about in the past, I never saw a cleaner piece of hardware that that LM looks right now.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Appropriately, finally we're getting - we're starting to use it during the Christmas season. It sure looks like a Christmas package with all the orange tape on it.|||CC|Roger.||00 23 08 38|CC|Ron, we got your NOUN - NOUN 05||00 23 08 42|CMP|Okay. I'll go ahead and accept that one this time.||00 23 09 29|CC|We got the 9 degrees, Ron. You can torque.||00 23 09 36|CMP|Okay. I'll torque at 940.||||||||Tape 18/5||00 23 09 44|CC|Okay. We got it.||00 23 09 56|CC|And, Jack, we've been looking at our records. We don't have a previous SYSTEMS TEST reading for 7 Alfa. Do you recall any previous readings on that one?||00 23 10 34|LMP|Okay. That looks like another accumulator cycle -got a MASTER ALARM.|||CC|We dropped data just then, Jack, so we can't concur or confirm it. That's exactly the right time - -|||LMP|... all right.||00 23 11 05|LMP|Bob, you cut out about your SYSTEMS TEST meter discussion.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Do you have any previous 7 Alfa readings? We don't have any in our log here written. We're just wondering what the past readings on that were.|||LMP|No, I think that was the first one we would have been called to make after a battery charge, right?|||CC|That's affirm, Jack.|||CC|Go ahead, Jack. I - you're coming in very weak.|||LMP|Well, I didn't intend to be transmitting. We were just discussing the battery vent and things. We may have missed something in the dump checklist. We'11 check it out.|||CC|No, sir. We don't think so. We just thought may-you might have read it earlier.||00 23 12 22|LMP|Oh, yes, you want the battery vent - It should be closed now, right?|||CC|Stand by, Jack.|||LMP|Okay. Ron says it ought to be open.||||||Tape 18/6|||||CC|That - that's affirm.|||LMP|... checked the checklist.||00 23 12 38|CC|It should be open. That - there's no question about that. It should be open.||00 23 12 4l|LMP|Okay. It's open.|||CC|Really, there's no problem, Jack. It should be open, but the value appears a bit low to us, and we'd like to read it again before you go to sleep. We may want to close it. And a nominal reading would be 1.7 - -|||LMP||||CC|- - on that.||00 23 13 06|LMP|Okay. We - we closed it when we were doing all our dumping some time back and neglected to open it again. So, it was closed when I gave you the reading, and it has been closed during some 2 hours, anyway. I'll - you can figure out how long.|||CC|Okay. We - we copy that.||00 23 13 57|CC|Jack, would you mind opening the vent and watching the system meter concurrently with it?|||LMP|Stand by.||00 23 15 11|LMP|Well, it's - it's CLOSED now, and it's still reading what it - 0.6. Do you want us to open it again?||00 23 15 21|CC|Roger. Open the VENT and - -||00 23 15 23|LMP|I mean, it's open now. I'm - I'm sorry, Bob. It is now open and reading 0.6. It read 0.6 when it was CLOSED.||||||||Tape 18/7|||CC|Okay. Just leave it open now.|||LMP|Okay.|||CC|And we will want to still check it prior to your sleep period.|||LMP|Okay.||00 23 15 07|LMP|Okay, Bob, a little update on the coast of Asia. It looks like some residual cloudiness would be affecting the Pusan region of Korea. And, also, that's residual after the frontal passage. And it looks like maybe Shanghai, after all, may have some storms associated with it, but it's really hard to pick out exactly - the exact coast line of Asia, but I - there are some clouds in the Yellow Sea behind the front, Look like they might be possibly some high cirrus is all.|||CC|Jack, do you still see that storm that you said was sitting between Guam and - Borneo in that area?||00 23 17 07|LMP|Okay. I see there is this cloud concentration between New Guinea and Guam. The more I look at it the less well developed it appears to me compared to some of the other circulation patterns. It could be just a residual depression from Teresa that has moved out into that area. It is an isolated, a relatively isolated cloud pattern, fairly small, but apparently fairly dense. But has - does not have a strong cyclonic pattern to it. Nothing at all like the pattern that now exists above Borneo and seems to be moving towards Luzon.|||CC|Roger. We copy.|||SC|Okay.||00 23 22 09|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're moving in the pieces of a Presleep Checklist. Here's some more read-outs for you. BATTERY C is 37-0; PYR0 BAT A, 37.2; PYR0 BAT B, 37-2; RCS A, 95; Bravo, 91*; Charlie, 94; Delta is 96.||||||Tape 18/8||||00 23 22 45|CC|Roger. We copy that. And if you've started it, we don't want you to reinitialize the PTC until about 2400 on the time line.|||CMP|Okay. We're - we're just getting a little ahead -we - took us longer last night on the presleep than we expected. We're trying to work it out again.|||CC|Yes. We don't to - we want to terminate the waste stowage vent at that time, because we think that that vent is what's contributing to our PTC coning.|||CMP|Okay. We're - we're not - we're not really ready to go to sleep yet, but we're just moving ahead.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|And if it's okay, I'll cycle the H2 fans.|||CC|Roger. We're standing by.||00 23 24 53|CMP|Okay. The fans are off.|||CC|Roger.||00 23 29 06|CC|Say, Jack, we got a request in here from our ARIA friends.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|They were just wondering if your looking out that way, if you could give them some sort of update of what the weather in the Wake Island - Kwaj alein -the south of the Wake area looks like.|||LMP|Okay. Let me work on that one.|||CC|Okay. You're going to mearn - earn your American Meteorological Society badge here pretty quick.||00 23 29 46|LMP|Okay. Let me get the monocular, and we'll look at Wake Island. I miss having all those nice latitude and longitude lines on the globe.||||||||Tape 18/9|||CC|... there,||00 23 34 26|LMP|Okay, Bob. I'll probably have to work on this one a little more, but - but it looks like around Wake, or in the vicinity of the Kwajaleins and north of Wake, about all you have is a lot of cloudiness although - and in a generally - over wide part of that Pacific, I'm talking about 15 or 20 degrees of longitude and latitude, there's a - roughly a clock - a clockwise circulation pattern. But the clouds do not look very dense or concentrated in any one area. And at leading off to the southeast from that general cloud mass , there're cyclonic - anticyclonic cloud mass is a - is one of the old fronts - or at least one of the old linear cloud patterns that extends down into the South Pacific.|||CC|Roger, Jack. I'm sure that the ARIA troops are listening down at Patrick and caught all that.|||LMP|Well, my guess is, Bob, and it's purely a guess, is that there - probably - if they were out there right now, would be experiencing an intermediate layer of clouds with scattered showers. And a not too strongly developed circulation system, so I can't predict the winds. But I wouldn't expect them to be anything - anything what might be down - associated with the remnants of the tropical depression Theresa. Now that Theresa - what's left of it, if I'm correct in - in picking it out there, probably is - is moving in that direction, although it looks weak enough. But right now I don't think it would be any big problem. And it may, in fact, go south of there.||00 23 36 55|CC|Roger. The prog I got in my hand for 3-hour-old weather has Theresa located just about in the Manila area. Did you concur with that, or do you think it passed the - the Philippines?||00 23 37 09|LMP|Well, I don't - Manila's clear. The only thing approaching near Manila is - is this other storm center that now is north of Borneo. And to the east of Manila, it's clear all the way over to this little cloud mass that I was guess might be Theresa.||||||Tape 18/10|||||CC|Roger. All I say, this is 3 hours old so - -|||LMP|- - And that's about - I gave Gene Kranz some coordinates on it. You can look it up. Those were pretty good coordinates for that cloud mass. Now whether that's really Theresa or not, I don't know.||00 23 37 45|CC|We got one thing with - for the last couple of hours here, we've been getting high-bit-rate data through our new facility - a new facility at Tidbinbilla, Tidbinbilla is to a 210 dish, and they're covering the first - -|||LMP|- - between Wake in the Kwajaleins , Marshall Islands, in that area, it doesn't look like a very concentrated weather pattern, although it looks like you'll have ceilings in that region. And they're overcast ceilings rather than broken. Except around the fringes of it.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|We'll keep an eye on it of course.||00 23 38 35|CC|Jack, how do you read us now?|||LMP|You're loud and clear.|||CC|Okay, 17, for the last 2 hours, we've been getting high-bit-rate data from a new facility, the facility at Tidbinbilla and they're working their first Apollo flight ever, you might give them a cheery hellow.|||LMP|Tidbinbilla, is that correct?|||CC|That's affirmative. It's very close to the Honeysuckle base - -|||LMP|Where is that?|||CC|Very close to Honeysuckle.||||||||Tape 18/11||00 23 39 19|LMP|Well, how you doing - how you doing mikes? We certainly appreciat,e you guys being on the loop for this one.||00 23 40 46|CC|17, Houston. We'd like ACCEPT, and we'll update your gyro drift, the pitch, roll, and yaw drifts.||00 23 40 57|CDR|Okay, got ACCEPT and POO.||00 23 4l 01|CC|Roger.||00 23 45 57|CC|17, Houston. The computer is yours. And you can go back to attitude and reinitialize PTC whenever you want to.|||CDR|Go ahead, Bob.||00 23 46 06|CC|The computer is yours, Gene - -|||CDR|Go ahead. We're reading you.|||CC|You can go to attitude and reinitialize PTC when-ever you want to.||00 23 46 19|CDR|Okay. Did you mean to leave the computer with VERB 21 NOUN 01 up?||00 23 46 23|CC|Roger. That's your computer with that - as you got it.|||CDR|Okay; that's right. That's l4 62. Okay.|||CC|17, Houston.|||LMP|Roger. Go ahead.||00 23 50 15|CC|Roger. We've got a recommended configuration for your H2 fans and H2 heaters. We would like the H2 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO and H2 FANS 1 and 2, OFF; 3 to AUTO. Your 02 heaters look good.||||||Tape 18/12|||||LMP|Okay. Let me verify that I've got these right. H2 HEATERS 1, 2, AUTO. 02 HEATERS, 1 OFF; 2, OFF; 3, AUTO. H2 FANS - Hg FANS, you want OFF; OFF; and AUTO. Is that correct?|||CC|That's what we want on the Hg FANS. And the 02 is fine, as you've got it.||00 23 51 l4|LMP|Okay. They're OFF, OFF - Okay; H FANS: OFF, OFF, and AUTO.||00 23 51 19|CC|That's affirmative, Jack.||00 23 51 35|CDR|Okay, Bob. I just cleaned the suit circuit return valve screen, here. It was probably, as expected, a little crud on it. A few things have collected, but really not too bad.|||CC|Roger, Gene.||00 23 53 30|LMP|Bob, a little more about Wake and the Marshalls and Kwajalein. That large pattern of what appear to be broken to overcast clouds in a - a clockwise circulation pattern - crosses the equator region now that I've tried to project that through.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||00 23 57 27|CC|17, Houston.|||CMP|17, go ahead.||00 23 57 36|CC|Roger, Ron. When you stop the present roll on the PTC to reinitialize, pick a roll angle of 315 or 130 for stopping, so that we have good comm during the damping period.|||CMP|Okay. 315 or 120, okay?|||CC|130, Ron.|||CMP|Okay. 315 or 130.||||||||Tape 18/13|||CC|Roger. That'll give us good comm to watch the data on the damping.|||CMP|Okay.||01 00 00 34|CDR|Hello, Houston. How do you read?|||CC|Read you loud and clear, 17.||01 00 00 40|CDR|Okay. We're at 300. Do you want us to go to 315 yet, or is 300 going to be okay?|||CC|That's good enough, Gene. And we'd like you to close your waste vent at this time, please.|||CDR|Okay.||01 00 01 12|CDR|Okay. It's CLOSED now.|||CC|Roger.||01 00 01 37|CC|And, 17, Houston. We've got the same recommendation. We recommend Alfa and Bravo for damping; Bravo and Delta for spinup. Over.|||CDR|That was Alfa and Bravo for damping and Bravo and Delta for spinup.|||CC|That's affirmative||01 00 04 51|CC|17, Houston.|||CMP|Go ahead.|||CC|If one of you want to break out the Flight Plan Supplement, we have a change to the E-LOADS on page 143 due to the change of gyro-compensation parameters.

Say good night, Dick.||||||||Tape 19/3||01 00 36 48|LMP|Bob? This is Jack. Your last report for the day as the Earth goes past window 5. The first thing I noticed was that our zero phase point is not nearly as bright on the west coast of Australia as it is on the - was on the east. And it's looking right at the coastline now and see no bright spot in the center. Also, that circulation pattern or tropical depression possibly that I saw earlier north of Borneo is now even more strongly developed at the tail end of the front that stretches up toward Japan. And it - it really looks like a humdinger from here. Beautiful circulation pattern and very concentrated. And it is now east of Vietnam, and again between Vietnam and - and the island of Luzon.|||CC|Roger. We copy.|||LMP|And I'd be very - be very curious to know tomorrow morning if you - you people are carrying that one on their progs or on their analysis chart.|||CC|Roger.||01 00 4l 33|LMP|Okay, Bob. You want me to erase something on page 1-43 and insert something else?|||CC|That's affirmative, Jack. On 1-43 under column A, down at line 11 and 12 and 13. Just to make sure you're at the right spot, the line 11 0-data is 00115. Do you copy that? Do you see that?|||LMP|I'm with you.|||CC|Okay. Change that line to 00377.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Change line 12 to 00050.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|And line 13, 00523. Over.||||||Tape 19/4|||||LMP|Okay, I got that and (laughter) as you might imagine, when I said erase, I did. And do you have the 04 and the 05 again, please? That is, if they're pertinent.|||CC|Stand by, Jack. I'm lost myself here a second.|||LMP|See, you gave me an update on 30704 and 31005, and I just erased it.|||CC|Okay, The 04 under column B is 34761, and the 05 line under column B is 15403. Over.|||LMP|Okay. Here we go. In line Alfa, 314 11, 00377; 315 12, 00050; 316 13, 00523. In line Bravo, 307 04 is 34761; 310 05 is 15403. Over.||01 00 44 13|CC|Roger. We copy, Jack. Just a reminder to be sure and configure the comm per the presleep checklist. And, just for your information, Jack, I - I hold you at 100,116 miles. I was going to give you a call at 100,000 even, and then I got talking to you. So you've crossed the 100,000 mark right now. Tomorrow, you're probably not going to be giving us our weather report, You'll be too far out, but we'll probably be starting to hear from the Moon, huh?|||LMP|We're not going to see much of the Moon, you know. It's going to be pretty dark, so I'll have to keep looking at the Earth.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Pretty good - pretty interesting place. Very interesting place.|||CC|I'm real sure.|||LMP|And I guess - I guess, maybe, I - 100,000 miles. My goodness gracious. That's impressive.|||CC|Yes, sir. You're slowing down all the way, Jack.|||LMP|Well, it's sure downhill all - all the way back, isn't it?||||||||Tape 19/5|||CC|That's for sure.|||CC|Jack, did the CMP get off the line, and is he sacked out now, too?|||LMP|Yes, I lost both those guys. They - they decided they wanted to sleep, and I may be rumbling around here for a while but I took - we all three took Seconal, so I think we'll get to sleep before long.|||CC|Roger. Just give us a call if you need anything, and we'll be watching everything there, and pleasant dreams.|||LMP|Now, you don't really mean that, do you?|||CC|Well, I can't come up and tuck you in so - hope you have a good sleep. You need lots of rest up there, gang.|||LMP|I'll tell you, Bob, about halfway though this day, I think I acclimated. And I really feel good. I've been eating a lot better, and I'm not - the only thing I ever really felt was a slight headache. It really - not the fullness of the head that people described, I guess, but just a little headache. I could have been looking at the Earth too much. I don't know.|||CC|Roger, Jack. You've been sounding good.|||LMP|Oh, actually, I feel - I've been feeling fine. Just - none of us have felt like eating. And that's probably normal, and everybody's eating more now, and we'll start getting to sleep, I think.|||CC|Roger. Jack, just a reminder on that comm for the presleep checklist. It's important to us because we can get the - we can get high-bit-rate data more.|||LMP|Bob, he cut out, but I'm in the comm sleep configuration now. I'm working that way.|||CC|Okay. Ed Grindell was shaking his head for a minute. Now he says as long as you're working that way.||||||Tape 19/6|||||LMP|Bob, you still cut out. Let's try it again.|||CC|No - no problem, Jack, Just a reminder on the comm; that's all. We're watching you go through the checklist here.|||LMP|Okay.||01 00 49 19|LMP|I'm on HIGH GAIN now, and OMNI Bravo selected.|||LMP|How do you read, Bob, on the HIGH GAIN?|||CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|Okay. And it's in REACQ and NARROW.||01 00 49 50|CC|Stand by. Stand by on that, Jack.|||CC|Say, Jack, can we refer you to the checklist on S/1-27, a sleep configuration there, where you S-BAND SQUELCH, ENABLE, et cetera?||01 00 50 50|LMP|Roger. I'm ENABLED.|||LMP|Oh, et cetera. Yes.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Okay. I'll get to that in a minute, Bob. Who knows, I might have something else to say.|||CC|Okay. (Laught er)|||LMP|Bob, I just probably ought to qualify all those remarks about the Earth's weather. It's purely novice talking about something he is very unfamiliar with, except for having a longstanding interest in it. And I think the one philosophical point, if any, that comes out of it is that somebody, probably 3-1/2 billion years ago or so, could have looked at the Earth and described patterns not too dissimilar. And it was within those patterns that life developed, and now you see, I think, and obvious to everybody, what that life has progressed to doing. And I certainly think all of us feel that it has not stopped doing that progression, and we'll probably see it do things that even you and I can't imagine them doing I certainly hope so.||||||||Tape 19/7|||CC|Roger, Jack. We concur.||01 00 54 11|LMP|Bob, you always wished that you had a poet on board one of these missions, so he could describe things that we're seeing and looking at and feeling in terms that might - might transmit at least a part of that feeling to everybody in the world. Unfortunately, that's not the case. But he certainly couldn't look at that fragile blue globe and not think about the ancient sails of life that are crossing its paths and wonder ahead to the - up to the present, to the modern sails of life that are represented by men that developed out of that life that are sitting there next to you and that are the country in all sorts of different guises and working towards the same end, and that is to put that life farther into the universe. I certainly hope that someday, in the not-too-distant future, the guy can fly who can express these things.|||CC|Roger, Jack. You're doing a pretty good job expressing them.||01 00 58 29|CC|Jack, Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Jack, we'd like to go to select OMNI Bravo, and stow the high gain the the normal stowage. It's customary we do not use the high gain for PTC going TLC.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. I'm sorry, but the checklist indicated that you do all go back to OMNI Bravo.|||CC|Roger. It's probably ambiguous. If you end up going up on the checklist, up to the top of 1-28, it shows you where you want OMNI Bravo.|||LMP|Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it,|||CC|Say again, Jack.|||LMP|Ambiguous is the best word I can think of for it.||||||Tape 19/8|||||CC|"Roger. We - I concur. I should have probably called you earlier and just pointed out on the Flight Plan where it says presleep checklist. And then there's the word ""coram,"" and it says ""omni,"" and that leads you into the checklist and makes sure you use the OMNI setup for - for the sleep configuration."|||LMP|Ho, ho, ho. Tricky fellows. I guess you're right.|||CC|Yes, it's something we don't - we don't - sim PTCs, TLCs, and TECs very often. That's for sure.|||LMP|Well, that's because we have a whole day to learn out here.|||CC|That's affirmat ive.|||LMP|OMNI Bravo.|||CC|Roger.||01 01 25 44|LMP|Okay, Bob. I think I'll hit the hay. How does everything look to you?|||CC|Looking pretty good, Jack. We'd like the S-BAND NORMAL VOICE to OFF, and S-BAND SQUELCH ENABLE, please.|||LMP|Yes, I'll get that. I just want to make sure that PTC and everthing looks good.|||CC|Yes, it looks real fine, Jack.|||||||||||LMP|Oh, gosh.||01 01 26 26|CC|Have a good sleep.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 20-23/1||||APOLLO 17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||||REST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS||||||||Tape 24/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||01 09 00 38|CC|Apollo 17, Houston.

It's here; one frankfurter, for lunch.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 25/3|||LMP|And we just changed LiOH canister as per the Flight Plan.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|And in a minute, I'll have weather report for you.||01 09 37 57|CC|Very well.||01 09 40 58|LMP|Hey, Gordy.|||CC|Go ahead.|||LMP|Gordy, the null bias check. Plus 0.9 and 100 seconds.|||CC|Okay, one question G&C had. Do you do that null bias at plus 100 or minus 100 on the EMS counter?|||LMP|Plus 100.|||CC|Okay, and it's increased up to 101.9, right?|||LMP|No, it increased to 100.9.|||CC|Roger. Miscopied you; 0.9. Okay; thank you.|||LMP|Yes, okay. Seems to me like last night it was 100.7.|||CC|Roger.|||CC|And for our part of the postsleep checklist, I have the consumables status, if you'd care to listen.||01 09 42 22|LMP|Stand by, Gordy.||01 09 45 11|LMP|Gordy, we'll take your consumables in a second. Let me bring you up to date on the weather around the world, if you're interested.|||CC|Yes, we are; go ahead.||||||Tape 25/4|||||LMP|Africa, looks in pretty good shape. There is a -except for an area probably around Zambia and Rhodesia in the tropical convergence zone there, where it looks pretty cloudy and probably quite rainy. There's a very strong circulation pattern and presumably a storm off - just off the coast of northwest Africa. Very spectacular spiral formation of clouds in a cyclone development. It looks like there are probably two fairly weak cyclones -Southern Hemisphere cyclones in the South Atlantic. One, southwest of Cape of Good Hope, and the other about due west of - of the Falkland Islands, maybe a little bit north of that. South America looks to be in quite good shape weatherwise, except possibly Uruguay and maybe northern Argentina which appear to have a - at least some fairly thick clouds there, although no strong circulation associated with this.||01 09 48 01|CC|Okay, Jack. We got all that up to Argentina, then the omni switch kind of cut you off.|||CC|Jack, we got the - at least the first part of your weather report fine up through the clouds in northern Argentina, and then the switch in omnis cut you out.|||LMP|Okay, that was about it, Gordy. That's - I'll talk to you some more later about it. I guess the main thing I need now is - are your consumables.|||CC|Okay. By the way, you were looking back from more than halfway to the Moon. You're about 125,000 out now. On the consumables, the RCS is running at 1.3 percent over the Flight Plan line. On the C>2Z tanks 2 and 3 are right on the line, end tank 1 is about 4 percent below the line. But it's been there all the way since launch, that same bias on tank 1. On the hydrogen: tanks 1 and 3 are right on the line, tank 2 is about 3 percent above the line. All in all, you're looking real good consumablewise.|||LMP|Okay. That's hardly worth writing down, I guess.||||||||Tape 25/5|||CMP|That's the way we like to see it.|||CC|Same here. The only other thing I have in the way of updates is a PIPA bias update. You can load it yourself, or we can load it when we come up with the up-link prior to the bum. Your choice. And then we'11 have an update to the erasable load update and a supplement to correspond with that bias update.|||CDR|Gordy, why don't you go ahead and load it yourself when you send up the vector?|||CC|Okay, and I'll give you that update for the supplement . It's on 1-43 whenever you're - whenever it's convenient.|||CDR|Okay, Jack's getting that out. I ran another PIPA bias at minus 100, and it confirmed the first one. It ended up at 99-2.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Go ahead with your update on 1-43, Gordy.|||CC|Okay. It's in the load A of the octal ID of 03, which now reads 77252. Change that to 77655|||LMP|Did you copy, Gordy?|||CC|I didn't copy your readback; no. Okay, 306 03 and Alfa 77655.||01 09 52 42|CC|That's right.||01 10 03 17|LMP|Gordy, how do you read?|||CC|Loud and clear.|||LMP|Okay. For the reference on - on those menus, at least for the LMP, I think I'm probably putting 8 or 9 ounces of water in the citrus drinks and those kind of things, rather than 7, which has probably upped my water intake some.|||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 25/6|||||LMP|And I think that probably goes for everybody. That probably goes for - it goes for Ron and probably Gene also.||01 10 03 52|CC|Roger.||01 10 10 05|CC|17, Houston. I have a little synopsis of the news here, if you'd like to listen during breakfast. Let me know.|||CDR|Okay, mighty fine. Send it up.|||CC|Okay, front page first. In Paris, Henry Kissinger met for 30 minutes this morning with French President George Pompidou at the Elysee Palace just hours before his scheduled conference with North Vietnamese Politburo member Le Due Tho - Tho, that is. North Vietnamese spokesmen accused Kissinger of attempting to force a peace settlement by threatening further escalation of the war. As both U.S. and North Vietnamese negotiators expressed disappointment at the continued deadlock, Chief American delegate William J. Porter traveled to Brussels to brief Secretary of State William B. Rogers. Rogers will - will return later today from the NATO Conference of Ministers. This one is datel - date - datelined Brussels. Diplomatic sources indicated today that NATO allies will request negotiations with the Soviet Union and its allies on mutual troop reductions in central Europe. Exploratory talks expected to begin about January 31, with full-scale negotiations to follow sometime next fall. In Kansas City, vital life signs for Harry S. Truman appear to have stabilized. But the 88-year-old former President remains on the critical list at Kansas City's Research Hospital. Truman is suffering from lung congestion and heart weakness. In Argentina, aides to popular Argentine politician Juan Peron said that Peron will refuse the nomination to the presidency of Argentina and will return to exile during the coming week. And, on the sports page, Rice coach A1 Conover is expected to reveal today - sometime today his decision to either remain at Rice as head coach or move to his alma mater Wake Forest in a similar position. The Owl head coach has said that he has been offered the job and promises a yes-or-no decision today.||||||||Tape 25/7||||There is some speculation that head coach Joe Paterno of Penn State may move to a head coaching job in the pros next year.

We're still trying to get the answer on whether you'll have a window. Stand by. I might have it here.||01 13 50 06|CC|America, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay. The LM inspection attitude that you'll go to results in kind of a marginal view of the Earth out of window 1, about 60 degrees away from it, bore-sight line of sight. And we're - we can - what||||||||Tape 27/3||||we've started to work on and if you wanted to do is you can go to kind of Intermediate attitude, which will be the LM attitude except for roll which will be off by about 60 degrees, which will - will give you a good view of the Earth out of window 1. And then when we get ready to do the LM entry, you can roll that additional 60 degrees to get to the proper attitude, if you wish. Your choice. Over.|||CDR|Yes, if that doesn't bother anybody down there, we'd like to do that.||01 13 51 06|CC|Okay. We'll have something for you here in a few minutes.||01 13 54 02|CC|Okay.

And we're pretty well squared away on the -all the command module stowage now, with minor exceptions.|||CC|Okay,||01 14 12 58|CC|America, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead and||||get on the high gain again since - and stop it just wandering around aimlessly. And how does the Earth look now?|||LMP|Sorry, Gordy, to be so slow. Earth looks great, and we'll get the high gain up in just a second.|||CC|Okay.||01 14 19 31|LMP|Houston, 17. How do you read?|||CC|Go ahead. You're loud and clear.|||LMP|Okay, Gordy, going from south to north on noontime, at least our noontime weather, it looks like there is a fairly strong mass of polar air moving from the southwest up towards Tierra del Fuego. It's mixed with some cloudiness that extends from that area all the way down to the Antarctic ice shelf. But it looks like some pretty good movement patterns from the southwest, north - northeast. No strong weather waves or cyclone development on that yet, although one may be picking up about halfway between Tierra del Fuego and the coast of Antarctica, the - where the front, or at least the cloud masses, curve from the east-west direction to an almost due south direction. Most of South America still looks like pretty good weather. There is cloudiness along the Andean Ridge and also in the Amazon Basin, stretching from the eastern coast of South America on up about, oh, two-thirds of the way towards Central America. It doesn't look like frontal weather there. It's probably tropical convergence weather. Now there is this - still this small, moderately||||||Tape 28/2||||||developed cyclone pattern that's hanging pretty much over Buenos Aires now, I think. Uruguay and Buenos Aires. I think I mentioned that earlier in the day. And that still is there, and I suspect those folks are getting a fair amount of weather out of it.|||CC|Roger.||01 14 22 00|LMP|Except for scattered clouds, Central America and Mexico, for the most part, are clear - as is most of the Caribbean Islands - Cuba and the others are -all look like they've pretty good weather. There's a little clouds off - cloud pattern off to the east of those islands, but it doesn't look like any major weather in that area. The eastern half and Midwest of the United States is completely cloud covered right now. There - however, the - extending from Mexico to Sonora and up into Arizona and New Mexico, and possibly as far north as Colorado, is a clear band. But then there is more cloudiness to the north of that. The Pacific regions west of - The West Coast of the United States is cloudy, at least west of Southern California. I cannot see Baja, so that cloudiness extends down south of - into Baja California. I see no strong new frontal patterns, although I'm looking right across the limb at the Earth now. There may be one that would be lying maybe across northern California and - and into Colorado, with a little clear area ahead of it, possibly in Kansas. But then into this, a solid bank of clouds that stretches from Brownsville, at least, clear up to - well, along the Gulf Coast across the panhandle of Florida, up the East Coast and on out past Nova Scotia, I'm sure. Florida is clear. Florida - the peninsular portion of Florida is - it looks very clear and some of the deep turquoise green waters to the south and southeast of that area are - are very obvious at this time.||01 14 24 43|CC|Roger, Jack. I'm following along on the satellite weather picture here that's taken from about your same vantage point and - although nowhere near the detail that you're describing.||||||||Tape 28/3|||LMP|Have you seen today's analysis charts of the United States or North America?|||CC|No, I haven't. I was just told, Jack, that the -the weathermen and a lot of other people around here, too, are following your weather reports with great interest.|||LMP|Yes. Does that mean they're right or wrong?|||CC|You've got the better view, by far.|||LMP|That doesn't prove much. Okay, Gordy, I'm - I suspect that that's a pretty healthy front. I don't know. Your weather must be cloudy and bad today. Is that right?|||CC|It is. We've got about a half-mile vis and drizzly rain.|||LMP|Okay. Well, I suspect comparable weather extends all the way across the eastern United States. That looks like awful dense clouds, although there's no obvious frontal pattern. It just stretches from the Midwest to the East Coast. And, also, there's no good indication of stratification of those clouds, as if they'd be fairly - fairly thick up into the cirrus levels.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|Looks like Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Sonora probably have some - one band of high cirrus. But other than that, probably a beautiful day out in that area.||01 14 27 20|LMP|There's some transverse cloud patterns over the Mississippi-Alabama area. It suggests maybe that the Jetstream may be just north of that region. But otherwise, there's no good indication of Jetstream position right now.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 28/4||||01 14 29 11|LMP|Gordy, there is one minor weather disturbance, possibly just about over Puerto Rico or maybe just -just to the east of that island. No strong circulation' patterns, although there's a hint of a cyclone development. There might be just a small depression in that area. I don't know whether your maps are carrying anything down there or not.|||CC|I think I see what you're talking about on the satellite picture, but I don't have a surface analysis that goes that far. I do - I just now got a copy of the surface charts for the United States. And there's - there's a front stretching from northern Texas northeastward up through Tennessee and Virginia and another one sort of parallel to it. But, this ... southward from Louisiana along the Gulf Coast across northern Florida and on out into the Atlantic. And I guess the two are kind of blending together to make that irregular mass of clouds you mentioned.|||LMP|Okay, Gordy. If I'd been a little more observant I could see that there was a little bit, looks like a decrease in at least the thickness of the clouds, vertical thickness, between the two areas you just mentioned. So, there is some indication here of those two fronts, although they are contributing to a general weather pattern in the eastern United States.|||CC|Roger.||01 l4 31 06|LMP|I think, with a little experience in this business, you might have picked those two out of that mass. But it's not immediately obvious.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|You got anything on there coming in from the northwest now, say up in Wyoming and Colorado?|||CC|The way it's drawn on this surface charts shows that - that northern front that I mentioned, just now, sort of curving on up through central Colorado, and then bending westward toward - through Utah. That's about the only other frontal activity. There's one, probably dry front, then a short one through central Arizona and southern Utah.||||||||Tape 28/5|||LMP|Okay. Well, that makes sense. That would match with that - what I was thinking was high cirrus in Arizona. And also I can see how you could bend - that's the northern front up through Colorado and then back westward to explain the patterns we're seeing in the clear areas south of that.|||CC|Roger.||01 14 33 04|LMP|Gordy, the zero-phase point now is off the coast of Chile and Ecuador - oh, maybe 10 or 15 degrees of longitude, and it is fairly dull. It does not seem to indicate any great amount of choppiness or wave action in that area.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|And about 15 minutes ago, Gordy, I took two more Hasselblad shots of the Earth.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|And, also, Houston, frame number - let's see, that's 16 and 17 - were taken of the Earth about 15 minutes ago, too. And that's magazine Sierra Sierra.|||LMP|Okay, Ron. We copy that.||01 14 34 55|LMP|Gordy, with respect to the icepack off the coast of Antarctica, it's difficult to distinguish pack ice from clouds, in general. However, the clouds seem to pick up reflection patterns with respect to the Sun. And using that as a - and some shadows in below as the criteria, it looks as if the pack ice in the South Atlantic would extend to a latitude almost comparable to that of Tierra del Fuego. I don't know whether that - that's reasonable or not.|||CC|Okay. I don't either. But maybe someone who's more of an expert can clear up your question on that. I111 let you know.|||LMP|Now to the southwest of Tierra del Fuego there's a - looks like a small cyclone developing, clockwise rotation, just off the edge of the pack ice,||||||Tape 28/6||||||and - but it does not seem to be closely associated with the frontal activity that I mentioned when I started out speaking at this - this particular time,|||CC|Roger,||01 14 36 36|LMP|There is another - there is another one, maybe a front, a little bit ahead of that cyclone that's now extending north-south. Starts in the pack ice area and extends up - oh, about halfway from there to Buenos Aires - in the direction of Buenos Aires. It doesn't look like a very major mass of air or frontal system. It may develop into something over the next couple days though.|||CC|Okay.||01 14 38 08|LMP|And centered, Gordy, at about 45 south and say 30 west, there is another cyclone area that's ahead of the last front I talked about that doesn't look - I think I talked about it yesterday - still does not look too strong, although the clouds, as I recall, the cloud cover is somewhat more well developed, and circulation patterns seem to be better developed. It may be an intensifying storm over what we saw yesterday.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I cannot see that it's associated with any clear frontal activity, however.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|That, I presume, should be migrating in the direction of the - of the southeast coast of Africa, so we'll keep an eye on it.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|And that reminds me, did you get any information cn the - that - what looked like a very strong, concentrated typhoon or hurricane in the South Pacific between Borneo and the Philippines?||||||||Tape 28/7|||CC|Let me check and see what we got on that. I wasn't here when you first talked about it evidently.|||LMP|Well, it was one that they didn't seem to be carrying, and it looked extremely well developed from here.||01 14 40 34|LMP|Gordy, yesterday that - the one I'm speaking of -was centered at about 15 north and a hundred and -make that about 117 east.|||CC|Okay. I've been informed that they are - the satellite people are carrying that one now. I'm not sure whether they had seen it before or didn't see it until after you did. But they are aware of it now and are tracking it.|||LMP|Well, we're not competing. They just didn't have any information for me on it yesterday. We'll probably be able to see that again late this afternoon.|||CC|Okay. The one that you just gave the coordinates on is - does have a name, - that's Therese, Hurricane Therese. And - so the - the other one must be the - must not have the name.|||LMP|Okay. Now which one has - is Therese.|||CC|The one you just - the coordinates you gave almost exactly pinpoint Therese.|||LMP|Okay. That's near the Philippines.|||CC|That's affirmative. Between there and Vietnam,||01 14 42 38|LMP|Okay. Well, then that sounds like - if that's an up-to-date position, it has relatively little movement since yesterday.|||CC|Roger. They show it moving just very slightly westward.|||LMP|Okay. Are they carrying anything south of Guam now that we talked about yesterday?||||||Tape 28/8|||||CC|Take a minute to get something on that. They don't have a current map showing anything in Guam right now.|||LMP|And we also had a storm developing south of - or southwest of New Zealand. Might look at that one, too.|||CC|Okay.|||CC|Jack, are you making these observations through the monocular?|||LMP|Yes, sir.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Although most of them - well, at this distance, Gordy, the circulation - detailed circulation patterns to say what's a cyclone and what isn't are not visible to the naked eye, at least not to mine.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|The major frontal patterns are, however.||01 14 46 49|CC|Jack, that disturbance you mentioned near Guam isn't being carried on the current charts here as anything significant. They do show some cloudiness north of the tropical convergence zone, but just that.|||LMP|Okay. Well, I had a feeling what I was seeing yesterday might have just been the remnants of Teresa [sic], which I think went - got into that area a couple days ago. It was not a very well-developed system, but did seem - seem to be isolated from the other cloudiness that I would have put into the tropical convergence zone. That was between Wake and Kwajalein.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 28/9||01 14 49 03|LMP|Gordy, let me try to give you a description of something that is a little bit unusual than what we've been seeing. The - there's an axis that runs from, say, the outer portion of the Ross ice shelf along the - and just off the coast of Antarctica, then bends up so that it would pass just to the east of Tierra del Fuego and - and then continues on that heading so that it would intersect the far east coast of South America, if it continued. Now along that axis, the - what appear to be multiple frontal patterns or at least linear cloud bands, bend very sharply and change from a heading that roughly parallels the axis around the one that is roughly north-south. And some of the front - frontal direction changes that I gave you earlier, down in that area, are - also bend around that axis.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|And there just, oh, there are probably a dozen, if you tried to pull them out, cloud bands between the Ross Sea and Tierra del Fuego that bend around the same axis. Quite striking.|||CC|Roger.||01 14 51 06|LMP|Now there's some indications, to me at any rate, that the Jetstream in that area may be essentially east-west - oh, maybe 20 degrees of latitude north of the Ross Sea, and then bends down very sharply so that it intersects the - or approaches the coa -Antarctic ice shelf to the east of the Ross Sea, and then maybe it bends up and forms the axis that I just described that's causing that bending of the cloud patterns.|||CC|Okay. Sounds like a good, theory.||01 14 52 08|LMP|There's a linear clear area in that area north of the Ross Sea that - and to the north of that is a sharply defined front that I talked about earlier. And then, both the - that front continues. The clear area is cut off by the axis that I described, a cloud axis.||||||Tape 28/10|||||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Now that should show up real well on the 250-millimeter pictures we took. Gordy, I'm back looking at zero-phase. And now, apparently, the exact zero-phase was partially obscured by a cloud pattern earlier. Now, when I - There is a very, very small bright spot in the center of the zero-phase area. Nothing comparable to what I described off the coast of Australia yesterday, but an extremely small spot. I suspect that the size of your bright spot in zero-phase has some direct -or indirect, at any rate, relationship to sea state.|||CC|Roger.||01 14 55 49|LMP|Gordy, as you might expect, the whole coastline of Chile is - or all of Chile, practically, is clear. Beautifully exposed to us here, particular the Atacama Desert, which is noted for that particular characteristic, and - at least among geologists it is. And the coast of Peru is also clear with clouds following the Andean Ridge, probably the - certainly the coast side of the Andean Ridge. Lima ought to be enjoying a very nice day today. The - Ecuador, however, looks like it might have a little more cloudy weather, although it doesn't look like any major storm activity.|||CC|Roger.||01 15 03 12|CC|America, Houston. We have a couple of words here on medications. Is everyone listening?|||CDR|Yes; we're on, Gordo. Go ahead.|||CC|Okay. Geno, you mentioned taking a nausea pill for some gas yesterday, and we were looking into some of the side effects. You definitely don't want to use that particular pill for gas. One of the side effects is that it's an appetite depressor. And there are some pills loaded in A-7, along with the vitamin pills, specifically for the purpose of eliminating gas. We would appreciate if you'd give us a call in advance prior to taking any medications except the Seconal and aspirin. Over.||||||||Tape 28/11|||CDR|Okay, Gordy, will do. I was aware that those gas depressors were around. At the time, we couldn't find them in A-7- And so I took one of those other things, whatever it is. And while you're talking about that, as per the preflight food check, gas is very evident on - particularly on me - and I think I'm suppressing it slowly. But is there any problem, or what do you recommend on that Mylinol [sic] or Mylicon or whatever it is?|||CC|Okay. Stand by 1.|||CDR|This goes hand-in-hand with the amount of gas that I experienced preflight.|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|And it's the kind of gas - it's the kind of gas that just stays in your stomach.|||CC|Roger.||01 15 05 43|CC|Okay, Geneo. The recommended use of those gas pills is to chew one after each meal. And then, if needed, chew up another one before going to sleep at night.|||CDR|Okay; fine. I chewed one after breakfast.|||CC|Okay. A little water after you chew it up, I guess, helps its effectiveness.|||CDR|That's a basic requirement, I believe. The effect of it has not been too obvious yet though.|||CC|Roger.||01 15 07 51|CDR|Gordy, you want the 02 HEATERS 1 and 2 to AUTO now?|||CC|That's affirmative.||01 15 08 06|CDR|Okay, They're there.||01 15 09 05|CDR|Gordy?|||CC|Go ahead.||||||Tape 28/12|||||CDR|I don't want to cause any concern on that gas. It's no real great problem. It's just a slight discomfort; that's all.|||CC|Okay, Gene. I think we understand.||01 15 10 31|CDR|Gordy, I have just eaten my first peanut butter sandwich in orbit around the Earth.|||CC|Roger. How was it?|||CDR|What's that?

Although, the surge tank shouldn't have caused it.|||CDR|Okay, let me give you one more try on it. Well, that time it didn't ... it. All I did was go up to 1 slash 2 and the ALARM came on.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Okay, I went back to surge/3; it did not. So maybe it's coming on when I go up to 1 slash 2.|||CC|Roger,|||CDR|Yes, there it is, Gordy. It's definitely repeat-able. I can go up to PRESSURE CRYO QUANTITY 1 slash 2 and the ALARM comes on.|||CC|Okay, Geno; understand.|||CDR|You might note that - hey -|||CMP|Okay.|||CDR|Gordo, you might think about the fact that we were getting them when the cabin pressure was high after launch.

Whereas one that's fully cocked and latched over there, the snowman's head points up at about 11:00. And -Okay, there is a lever that comes right out of the bottom of the power bungee, it looks like, and then it comes out of the bottom then left out of that lever, is another silver slot or silver bar that goes from the lever to the J-hook with the snowman on it.

I answered you, you said about three words, then dropped off completely. And then we - we changed configuration.||01 17 43 09|CC|Okay, Jack.

We think, though, we have a good handle on the problem.|||LMP|Okay; very good.|||LMP|Are you ready for us to press on here, Gordy? We're all stowed and - in pretty good shape in the LM.||01 17 57 29|CC|Okay. We'd like you to check one more switch first before moving on. Check the UPDATA LINK switch to OFF.||01 17 57 40|LMP|Okay, That is verified OFF.||01 17 57 43|CC|Roger.||01 17 58 01|CC|Want you to stand by a minute or 2, Jack, until we verify a funny-looking parameter here on that up-link switch.||01 17 58 17|LMP|Standing by. What's that? No, they want - they got something looking funny on the up-link -they're - I guess on the up-link switch.|||CC|Challenger, Houston.|||LMP|They want to look at it.|||CC|That was a bad call. We were reading the data wrong. You're clear to press on with the checklist now on page 1-20.||01 17 58 50|LMP|Okay. We'll press on. Geno, here is your jettison bag. You can get back to Ron.|||SC|||01 17 59 08|LMP|Okay. S-BAND T/R, OFF; VHF, OFF. I can hear you.||01 17 59 24|LMP|PM, OFF.|||CC|Roger, Geno.||||||||Tape 30/11|||SC|Okay, Houston. We just transferred to CSM power, and the caution warning light did go off.|||CC|Roger.||01 18 21 25|CT|You going back to air-to-ground 1?||01 18 21 32|CMP|Okay. I heard somebody go to air-to-ground 1 that time, and -|||SC|Gordo, we're about wrapped up here in Challenger. It looks like there's some life in the old bird, huh?|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Okay. We'll give you a call when we get the hatch closed. Ron's doing some housekeeping in the command module, and we're going to take it slow getting back in.|||CC|Okay, Gene.|||CMP|Okay, Houston. The drogues are going in.||01 18 21 40|CC|Roger, Ron. Got a couple of questions on those -that latch number 4, if you can answer them for me.||01 18 22 00|CC|America, Houston.||01 18 22 43|CC|America, Houston. We're back with you after some site changeover. How do you read?|||CMP|Okay; loud and clear. How me, Bob?|||CC|Real good, Ron. On that number 4, latch number 4, is the hook back away from the ring about 1 inch as opposed to resting against the ring? Do you have about an inch clearance on that hook right now?|||CMP|Well, there's about 1/2 inch.||||||Tape 30/12|||||CC|Okay. Understand about 1/2 inch. In what position was the latch handle when the hook was first moved back, Ron? We it kind of like in a normal stroke-back, or was it just flopping back?|||CMP|No, when I first looked at it, the latch handle was - see, the hook itself was over the ring when I first looked at it.|||CC|Roger. We understand that.|||CMP|The hook was over the ring, and the - and the latch handle was flush, you know. It looks just like a normal - hooked docking latch, you know.|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||CDR|And, Bob, this is Gene. I can confirm that it did not fold back easily, because I - I checked it yesterday. I didn't check - I checked to see that the hooks were over as well as where the handles would fold back, but I obviously didn't check to see whether that one was seated. But the handle was locked.|||CMP|That's right.|||CC|Roger. Understand. And the first thing you saw was the depression in the Bungee. Is that - is that affirm?|||CMP|Yes, that's affirm. And the bungee is depressed about 3/8 - 3/8 to a 1/2 inch.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|You can push the - you can push the hook about an inch away from the ring, but the normal - just a resting position on the thing is about a finger's width or 1/2 inch from the ring.|||CC|Roger. In other words, the loose - The hook is loose so it flops a little bit; you can move it back and forth. Is that affirm?||||||||Tape 30/13|||CMP|Yes. I can move it from about 1/2 inch to an inch from the edge of the ring - clearing the edge of the docking ring.|||CC|Roger. Ron, when you pulled the hook - when you pulled the handle back, did you reach and pull the hook back with it, or did it come back with the handle like a normal pullback then?|||CMP|No, the - the hook did not come back with the handle. The hook did not come back with the handle. Although, when I - when I pulled the handle back to - you know, which is - which is kind of a normally uncocked position - and then it wouldn't go any further, you know. It wouldn't go an further. And then the latch itself - or the hook - the J-hook; I'll call it the hook. I moved it off the docking ring back to this position that was about an inch or 1/2 inch from the docking ring. And it stays right there now. And I can't push it back up into the docking ring at all. Can't push the hook back up to the docking ring at all.||01 18 26 28|CC|Okay. We copy that.|||CC|Okay, Ron. Our plan here is to leave it like it is. And we're going to think about it tonight, and we'd like you to just keep pressing on. Just leave it alone, okay?||02 18 26 56|CMP|Okay. Sounds good. It'll clear the docking ring; no problem.||01 18 27 06|CDR|Houston, America. While Ron is putting in the probe and getting the hatch back in, I'm going to go ahead and maneuver. How does that sound?||01 18 27 19|CC|That's real fine, Gene.||01 18 29 17|CDR|Bob, are you all going to want OMNI or HIGH GAIN on this?||01 18 29 24|CC|Stand by on that.||||||Tape 30/l4|||||CC|We're all locked on the HIGH GAIN. We'd just like you to leave it on HIGH GAIN. The angles you see in the Flight Plan are in case it breaks lock. That's what you need for - with this attitude.||01 18 29 56|CDR|Okay.||01 18 33 11|CMP|Okay, Houston. The probe is installed. We'll get the hatch in now.|||CC|Roger, Ron.|||CMP|I'm not going to connect the umbilicals unless you really want to look at probe temperature.|||CC|Stand by on that, Ron. We concur on that, Ron.||01 18 33 44|CMP|Okay; good.||01 18 39 29|CMP|Okay, Houston. The hatch went in nominally, once the probe installation strut was stowed in the right position.||01 18 39 42|CC|Roger.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 31/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||01 18 43 46|CC|17, Houston. We - we are recommending quads Bravo and Delta for spinup.||01 18 43 56|CMP|Okay; Bravo and Delta. Thank you.||01 IS 57 53|CMP|Okay, Houston. At 042:56:52.04, I started the stop watch, and also the watch read 18:30:01.|||CC|Okay, Ron. We got that.||01 19 02 24|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've started on the heat select radial and lineal part - part of it. The little pie-shaped things are changing color as we go out. The lineal part of it - all of the chips seemed to have been concentrated on the front edge of the glass, and they're all pretty much in the linear direction or in XX-direction. At this point in time, I haven't seen any movement yet.|||CC|Roger, Ron. Aren't they on ... heads the same way they were on the backup unit the other evening in the White Room - on the lamp?|||CMP|Yes, all those chips seem to be - well - in an XX-I got the lineal direction, the lineal part of the experiment in the XX-direction. And all the chips are lined up in that XX-direction on the front or the top of the glass.|||CC|Roger. That's just the way ou were in the backup unit the other day in the White Room.|||CMP|Yes, that's right.||01 19 11 36|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've started the cooldown in LIGHT 5 position there. The radial cells, they all started to change color except the one from about 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.|||CC|Roger. Except from 10 to 12. We've got It. Did the lineal ... stay right in line there, Ron?||||||Tape 31/2|||||CMP|Yes, the crystals or chips that are inside there didn't move at all. Yes, they're ... - -|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|On the color patterns behind there - the one on the left, as you look at the unit - the color crystals only changed down to about 0-9 of the first square as you come down from the top. The rest of them are all black on that partic - on the left row.|||CC|Roger, Ron.||01 19 12 44|CMP|So that's the maximum extent of the - that's the max extent of the heating.||01 19 12 59|CMP|You might check and see if the guys want to heat it a little bit longer the next time, when they do it in the PTC.|||CC|Yes. Roger, Ron. We're copying everything you're saying, and we've got all kinds of support here; we - in fact, we've got one backup unit here watching what you're doing, so we'll keep you posted on what we think.|||CMP|Oh, okay. Is the backup CMP operating it?|||CC|Matter of fact, that's affirm.|||CMP|That's the way to do things.|||CC|And, Ron, we'd like you to stay nominal on the heating time due to the film limitation.|||CMP|Okay; will do.||01 19 15 09|CMP|Okay, Houston; 17 here. Is there enough film in there to allow me to keep the camera running while I try to fill up that flow pattern.|||CC|Stand by on that, Ron.|||CC|It's affirmative, Ron. You can leave it running.||||||||Tape 31/3|||CMP|Okay.||01 19 16 51|CMP|Okay, Houston. The first thing I noticed, as soon as I opened the FLOW four turns, it started running out a little bit, even - even without doing the inject. Okay; that's because the INJECT thing was open just a little bit, but It's all right.|||CC|Roger. We copy.||01 19 17 22|CMP|Okay; I'll try to squirt some fluid in there -|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|With the fluid inject thing.||01. 19 18 11|CMP|Okay; I'm taking it in quite slow. It's noted there are quite a few small bubbles coming out with it. So far, so good. It hasn't overflowed the - the first capillary ring. And it's taken off, and it's going by capillary action toward the bottom and toward the top.|||CC|Roger, Ron.||01 19 19 26|CMP|Okay; it finally met together at - that part going around the top and around the bottom - met together 180 degrees opposite of the inject port and now is starting to go out across the middle and fill up from the inject port.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 20 58|CMP|We're getting a lot of big bubbles coming out now. That's after about a turn and a half.|||CC|Roger. We copy.||01 19 21 4l|CMP|Okay; that's two turns now. the meniscus is still holding on the first inner ring - it looks like all the way around, at least as far as I can see. The bubbles - big bubbles that have been coming out now, and also the fluid have taken over the right half of the bottom of the dish. We're starting to fill in a little bit, maybe a fourth||||||Tape 31/4||||||of an inch - fourth of an inch circumference coming around from the left side opposite the injection port.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 22 31|CMP|Okay; I'll keep going here. We're about two and||||a half turns now. And it looks like all of the bubbles have already come out. We're getting real fluid now coming out. It's a real pretty picture anyhow.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 22 55|CMP|Okay; that's three turns. I don't believe we're going to be able to cover the entire bottom with the four turns.||01 19 23 27|CMP|Okay. That's four turns, and - it's covered up the right - oh, three-fourths of the floor of the thing and about three-eights of an inch on the left side of the - of the floor - three-eights of an inch annulus all the way around, except for the right - oh, say right two-thirds of the floor.|||CC|Roger, Ron. You can use more than four turns if you need it.||01 19 24 02|CMP|Okay; let's go ahead and try to cover up the whole floor on the thing before we do it. The bubbles are in there, and I'm afraid they're going to stay un - unless they disappear when we heat it.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 24 35|CMP|There now it's - it's coming out with no bubbles now, and it looks like it almost formed a meniscus on top of itself - on top of where the bubbles were.|||CC|Roger, Ron. Is it continuing to spread out?|||CMP|Yes, it's continuing to spread out now, and without pumping anything into it at all - I did that last turn fairly fast - and it seems to be||||||||Tape 31/5||||spreading of its own accord now, and it should go on over and cover up the bottom, I think. Once it completely covers up the bottom, I think we should go ahead and start the heat HIGH on this pattern.||01 19 25 59|CMP|Okay. Now the - Everything's all hooked together now. We completely filled up the bottom of the floor.||01 19 26 15|CMP|Hey, for some reason, the bubbles seem to be starting to break now.|||CC|Roger. We copy that, Ron.||01 19 26 53|CMP|Okay. I don't know if it's coincidence or what, but all the bubbles are formed together, essentially in the center - in more or less at least -I mean - yes, along the plus-X-axis direction. And they're about 1 inch wide. And then they start about three-quarters - I mean three-eights of an inch in from the circumference.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 27 58|CMP|Okay; I was going to try to break the bubbles with a pencil, but if you try to push a pencil into the bubble, it just moves aside.||01 19 28 23|CMP|So that being the case, I'm going to go ahead and start the - start the timer.|||CC|We concur on that, Ron.|||LMP|That's called the old push-a-bubble-with-a-pencil trick.|||CC|Roger. Just need a sharper pencil, Jack.|||LMP|Either that or a thinner bubble.||01 19 29 18|LMP|This is the best Friday afternoon matinee I've ever been to.|||CC|How about Friday evening, Jack?||||||Tape 31/6|||||LMP|Well, I've lost track. I don't think - I don't think there's any ... -|||CMP|Stand by.||01 19 29 38|CMP|MARK. That was 1 minute after the start.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|I'll give you another mark when I go to HIGH on the - with the SELECT switch.||01 19 30 38|CMP|MARK it.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 31 36|CMP|Each bubble looks like it's locus of - it looks like it's starting one of the Be mu - Bernudi cells.|||CC|Say that again, Ron?|||CMP|Okay; each one of those bubbles looks like it1c the locus - or the start of one of the Benard cells.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|So far, the bubbles aren't breaking.|||CC|We copy that.|||LMP|Is Stu getting - did Stu get bubbles on his pattern, Bob?|||CC|We're not running it down here. We're just demonstrating on the demonstrator there, but Stu can tell you.|||LMP|Oh, I thought you were running - -|||MCC|Roger, Jack. Yes, I - you're talking of the one that - that we did, right?||||||||Tape 31/7|||LMP|That's right. Well, I am now. I thought you were running it down there also.|||MCC|No. Okay. The one that we did in flight - Yes, I had - I had a lot of bubbles, but I couldn't get mine - Krytox out across the center. So, you all are already well ahead of what I did.|||LMP|Gee, I'm sorry you had to admit that, Stu.|||MCC|Oh, you all just do such good work.||01 19 33 05|CMP|Okay, the thing is, it seems to me like, in one g, the Benard cells started completely back to the edge, you know, right back to the edge of the circle. And in this case, at least, they haven't filled in yet back to the edge of the circle at all. They all started out in the center and are working around the bubbles, and then it's now -just now starting to form a few of them where there aren't any bubbles.|||CC|Roger, Ron,.||01 19 33 37|MCC|How large are the cells, Ron?|||CMP|Well, they're varying considerably in size. I can see one that's about a half an inch across, and then the other ones - they've got a great big bubble in it, and yet the cell itself is down to maybe an eighth of an inch. The bigger ones seem to be on the outside; and, of course, there are very few bubbles on the outside also.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|And the bigger ones, generally right now, are averaging about - oh, a fourth to three-eights of an inch in their cross - cross section ,..||01 19 34 57|CMP|The cells tend to be somewhat polygonal. Let's see, we've been going 6 minutes - 4 minutes into the heating part of it, and the - the cells are polygonal, but they don't seem to be quite as - as straightlined as they were on the ground.||||||Tape 31/8|||||CC|Roger. We copy.||01 19 36 18|CMP|It almost looks like it's reached a steady state now. It's 9 minus 2-7 minutes.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 36 30|CMP|Hey, I think the one thing I neglected to mention is that we essentially have a convex surface from the - the material; in other words, con - convex with the high part in the middle; and, of course, that's where the bubbles are, too, but I think you'd generally have that type of a surface anyhow And, It hasn't broken the meniscus of the lower, or the thinnest ring.||01 19 37 35|LMP|We should have had some popcorn on our stowage list.|||CC|Roger.||01 19 39 48|CMP|Okay; now the Benard cells are starting to form in that outer annulus that went all the way around||01 19 45 55|CC CMP|Roger. Okay; we went back to light 4 now. And we never did get any real beliginal [sic] cells formed around the outer annulus. And even the cells that were formed on the thing, it seemed like the particle flow within the cells was very slow when you compare that with the way it was in one g.|||CC|Roger, Ron.||01 19 48 03|CMP|Okay; I'm trying to - such the stuff back in the -the entry tube there, and it looks like part of it's going in.|||CC|Roger, Ron. We copy that.||01 19 49 07|CMP|And the camera is down to about 50 percent here, so I'm going to go ahead and turn it off now.|||CC|Roger, Ron.||||||||Tape 31/9||01 19 49 40|CC|Ron, if I didn't tell you, we concur with turning the DAC off there.|||CMP|Okay; yes, I got you. I'll turn it off.||01 19 50 06|CMP|You know, I just happened to think, after I've already sucked part of those bubbles back in there, we've got enough fluid in there to pump it out the next time without sucking that back in there, don't we?|||MCC|I'm sorry, Ron. Say that again.|||CMP|Don't we have enough of the Krytox fluid without sucking that back in there? Maybe I can just wipe the Krytox off with some Kleenex, and maybe there won't be any bubbles the next time.|||MCC|Okay; stand by.||01 19 51 00|MCC|Ron, I guess we understand you've pulled some back in, but you haven't pulled any of the bubbles. Now, if you pull any more in, you're going to start the bubbles back In. Is that correct?|||CMP|Yes; that's correct.|||MCC|Okay; why don't you stand by here on that then?|||CMP|Let me see - I'll see if I can push the bubbles out of the way here with something.||01 19 51 29|MCC|Okay. The consensus is that we would like to not pull the bubbles back in. I think you've got a good idea.|||CMP|Okay.|||MCC|It's the old keep-the-bubbles-out-of-the-Krytox trick.||01 19 51 48|CMP|(Laughter) Okay; I'll see if I can do It.||01 19 52 09|LMP|I see you're finally getting caught up in the humor of the thing there, Stu.||||||Tape 31/10|||||MCC|Oh, I've always been in good humor. It sure sounded like that batt did the trick, Ron.|||CMP|Yes, I think it did, too. It looks like it worked real well.||01 19 56 21|MCC|And, 17, just so you say we didn't give you our cue, we're standing by for the 1-17 procedures there in your Experiments Checklist - the film cycling.|||CMP|Okay; we'll have to get that shortly.|||MCC|Okay.||01 19 57 53|LMP|Okay, Stu, we got you on that. The Saturday afternoon or Friday evening matinee was absorbing us so, we almost missed it.|||MCC|Okay.||01 20 03 28|LMP|Okay, Houston.

Thank you.|||CC|Roger.||01 20 13 30|CC|Jack or Ron, when you come around, we'll ask you to stow the high gain on our call, and we'll be wanting OMNI Bravo.|||LMP|Roger.|||LMP|And are you ready for the trotting gourmet's report?|||CC|roger. Everybody's here with all ears.||01 20 14 02|LMP|Okay. The CDR today had scrambled eggs and three bacon squares and a can of peaches and pineapple drink for breakfast. And then later on in the day, he had peanut butter, jelly, and bread with a chocolate bar and some dried apricots. The LMP had scrambled eggs and four bacon squares, an orange drink, and cocoa for breakfast, and potato soup, two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and||||||||Tape 31/13||||a cherry bar, and an orange drink. And that hero of the matinee, the matinee idol of Spaceship America, had scrambled eggs, bacon squares, peaches, cinnamon toast, orange juice, and cocoa for breakfast. That's how he keeps his form. And, for lunch, he had a peanut butter sandwich and citrus beverage. And that's it, since there's nobody else up here.||01 20 15 45|CC|Roger. We copy that. We'd like you to stow the high gain at this time and OMNI Bravo.||01 20 16 4l|CC|Jack, we appreciate all your information, and we'd like to just pass on some recommendations here from the ground that we'd like you to keep on with your regular menu as much as possible.

Got a little information on what we were talking about yesterday with respect to southern Pacific weather, if you've got nothing else going on.|||MCC|Go; speak to me.|||LMP|Okay, looks like a little - cyclonic circulation we had over New Zealand is still there. It's -looks like the front it was associated with is broken up a little bit; however, that pattern is -seems to be hugging the New Zealand area, and -but not - has not intensified. If - if not - it may have even weakened a little bit since yestery-day. It's hard to be sure exactly. The front does not look as strong, and it still seems to be hanging just stabilized and with all of Australia clear now and the western edge of that front being just offshore north of Brisbane. The - there is -east of New Guinea - in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands, it looks like a fairly moderate-sized cyclone developing at the western edge of the - of a front that was somewhat farther north and west than the one over New Zealand. North of that -Wake/Kwajalein region that was of interest||||||Tape 32/2||||||yesterday to the ARIA people - still seems to be in general overcast condition, but the clouds iio not look very heavy or impacted at all. New I'uinen. is just on the limb, so -||01 20 28 27|LMP|Oh, I think I lost them.||01 20 31 56|MCC|Okay, I think we've got you now, 17.|||CMP|You're loud and clear, Stu.|||MCC|Okay.||01 20 32 46|LMP|Stu, I think we lost you about the time I lost view of the Earth and mentioned the Wake/Kwajalein area; right?|||MCC|That's affirmative. We didn't et much of the Kwajalein report.|||LMP|There was nothing new to add over yesterday. There just seems general cloudiness in the area, but they do not look too intense or well organized. Just probably a general overcast.|||MCC|Okay.|||LMP|I'll try to get some exercise, and then I'll be back at you with some more information. Maybe we can see the Philippines by then.|||MCC|Okay.|||LMP|And, Stu, I've got my biomed hooked up. Are you guys bringing it in during this exercise thing? This is Jack.|||MCC|Yes, Jack. We'll check on that.|||MCC|Okay; you're coming in loud and clear, Jack.||01 20 34 15|LMP|Okay.||01 20 35 46|CDR|Stu, are you reading?|||MCC|Roger. We're reading you loud and clear.||||||||Tape 32/3|||CDR|Okay, I think that big storm that Jack was referring to - that has moved off to the - well to the east of Australia. Very definite counterclockwise rotation and then it stretches to the south or what might even be the southeast. And then just rolls right -we ... a big frontal pattern and then rolls right into another - another clockwise - clockwise rotating low down there near Antarctica. It gives me the impression of a - of a parrot's comb when he's got his feathers ruffled. And it, in turn, has another low trailing it, arcing and then flowing into another - another low that is very near the continent down there of Antarctica. They form a chain, as I just described froming - coming from -well, possible southeast of Antarctica - it's hard to really tell what east is down there - on up to due west of Australia by several hundred miles.|||CC|Roger.||01 20 37 20|CDR|South of Australia, you get a hint of a very large cloud mass, from there all the way down to Antarctica, that has the tendency to - -||01 20 39 44|CC|17, Houston.|||CC|17, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|Just wanted to get comm there again. We had some switchover there. You might be interested; we've got an ATS map in here from this morning. Just -you're just about on - We can see the flow patterns in the Antarctic just about at - 120 degrees west, which is a little closer to South America than what you're calling, I guess. But we do - we do see that activity down there.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. And there is a very large cloudy n. ir mass between Australia and Antarctica. Tt ha:: a tendency to want to start a rotation, and you can see a. hint of that; it's not too strong right now. We're seeing about three-quarters of the Earth, I guess. Judging from our clocks and what we can see, it looks like the Sun is setting out over the west coast; and it leaves us with about three-quarters of the Earth available to us.||||||Tape 32/4||||01 20 4l 21|CC|Roger. It'll be about 06:15 Los Angeles time right now, so it's probably sunset out there.||01 20 42 4l|CC|Ron, just a reminder from the Flight Plan change last night. You'll have a P52 coming up here at 45 hours in your Flight Plan.|||CMP|Roger. Mighty fine; thank you.||01 20 42 58|CC|Roger, Ron.||01 20 46 32|CC|Jack, just for information, you've got your heart rate to 103.||01 20 48 25|CC|Jack, you've got your heart rate to about 103; and we lost data right now.|||CC|Jack, just for information, the last heart rate we had was 103; and it's - we lost data right now, so 103 is max we saw right now.|||LMP|Okay, I was just doing some isometrics. I was tired running in place again then.|||CC|Roger. Do you want us to call you your heart rate if - if we get data in here now?|||LMP|Sure.||oi 20 4g i4|CC|Okay.||01 20 50 25|CC|Okay, you're up to 115, Jack.||01 20 56 20|SC|||01 20 59 55|CC|What are you doing, Jack, - resting, or did you quit?|||LMP|No, I'm resting right now. Didn't seem like my arms have the stamina they did yesterday to hold the artificial g. What - -|||CC|... understand.|||LMP|- - did I get to?|||CC|We copied about a maximum of about 118 - -||||||||Tape 32/5|||LMP|What heart rate did - -|||CC|- - on the heart rate.|||CC|About 118 max, Jack.|||LMP|Roger. Understand.|||CC|Don't let me - let me harrass you. I just wan kidding you on that. Whatever you think is fair.||01 21 00 30|LMP|You're not harrassing me. When my arm's rested, I'11 try again.||01 21 00 52|CC|Couple of interesting data points for you, Jack. We saw the - while you were doing that, we saw the PP COg go up; and we saw the tanks destratify again the same way.|||LMP|Very good. Next mission they'll have to Flight Plan it.|||CC|That's affirmative.|||LMP|You saw the P CO^ go up?|||CC|That's affirmative. Let me get the numbers here, if you want. It took a jump from 1.3 to 2.4 on that.|||SC||||LMP|Okay. That - that was with two of us going, and, part of the time, three of us going.|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||LMP|Now we've still got one going.|||CC|Well, it's not unexpected. I just thought you'd be interested.||01 21 01 52|LMP|Sounds sort of normal.||01 21 03 03|LMP|Hey, Bob, with this change in the hour, what time does penumbra start?||||||Tape 32/6|||||CC|Say again the question, Jack. What time does what start?|||LMP|With the change in hour, what time does the penumbra - what time do we enter the lunar penumbra?|||CC|Right now, we don't - Tommy doesn't think we're going to go into the penumbra, and we're verifying that.|||LMP|Okay.|||CC|Hey, Ron, could we ask a question about the hent-flow experiment setup?|||CMP|Sure. Sure, go head.|||CC|You mentioned that the lineal chips were all on the - in the XX plane, and we're just wondering -do you mean along the XX axis of the spacecraft?|||CMP|Yes; along the XX axis of the spacecraft.|||CC|Is the long XX axis of the lineal cell along the XX axis, Ron?|||CMP|Yes, that's affirmative. It's right-side up, if you're looking at the connect panel, you know?|||CC|Yes. That's - we'd - they'd like it so that that -the axis of that lineal cell was - would be parallel to the bottom of the panel 100, as an example. It's prob - right now, it's perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100, isn't it?|||CMP|Now, wait a minute.||01 21 05 17|CMP|Yes, the lineal thing is, right now, perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100.||01 21 07 36|CMP|Hey, Houston; America.|||CC|Go ahead, Ron.|||CMP|Okay, I think I see what you're saying. I'm sorry; I read the thing with lineal cell in a plus-X direction. But what they mean is, lineal cell in the - in - (laughter) -||||||||Tape 32/7|||CC|Lineal word, I guess, is the - -|||CMP|... lineal cell up.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|Okay, I'll turn around the other for this PTC part of it then.|||CC|Wait a minute on that, Ron. We're having a debate whether we want to, maybe, continue the next part in the same attitude or just rotate it .|||CMP|Okay. Seems to me like you'd like to - maybe leave it in the same attitude.|||CC|Ron, the only rational reason to change it right now is we're hearing words that if you had rotated to the other way, that you'd get better pictures out of the DAC due to the lighting reflection on it. The PI would like to change it back to the other way.||01 21 09 07|CMP|Okay.||01 21 12 31|CC|17, just for information, we will not be going into the penumbra.||01 21 12 4l|LMP|Okay. Sorry to hear that.||01 21 15 45|CC|Ron, we see your 52; and you can go ahead and torque.|||CC|Ron, Houston. We're watching your 52, and you car. go ahead and torque.|||CMP|Okay, Houston; 17. Thought you said go ahead and torque. Is that correct?|||CC|That's affirmative, Ron.|||CMP|Okay. We'll torque at 1630.||01 21 16 30|CC|Roger.||01 21 23 50|CC|Ron, a couple reminders - The LOI [sic] - -||||||Tape 32/8||||01 21 24 59|CC|17, Houston.||01 21 25 53|CC|17, Houston.|||CMP|Roger. Go ahead.|||CC|Roger, Ron. Just a reminder on the L0I [sic] canister change - Have you gotten into that?|||CMP|No, not yet. We're - probably get started on this -|||CC|Okay. On the - -|||CMP|On the heat flow first.|||CC|Roger. Understand. We'd like to know when you start on that heat flow, Ron, because we need to get the DSE to high bit rate.|||CMP|Okay. I'm having a little trouble getting them mounted - in a stable position this way,||01 21 26 44|CC|Understand.||01 21 29 50|CMP|Okay, Houston; this is 17. I'm about ready to start it here in about 45 seconds here; let me know when you get the tape recorder going.|||CC|Roger, Ron.|||CC|Okay, we got the tape recorder in HIGH BIT RATE.|||CMP|Okay.|||CC|Hey, stand by 1, Ron. We got a little change here we'd like to make on the plan on page 2-6.|||CMP|Okay. Stand by for zero. 3, P, I -||01 21 30 36|CMP|MARK it. It's reset. Start the stop watch.|||CC|"Roger. And, Ron, on the checklist on page 2-6 after the l6-minute ""End of test and proceed to next test,"" we'd like to turn the DAC OFF at that position."||||||||Tape 32/9|||CMP|Okay. Will do.|||CC|"And, then, you turn it back on at the re - where it says ""Reset stop watch and start. The time zero there - point. Prior to that, turn it on. 1111 remind you of it."|||CMP|Okay. You don't want to watch me fill that pan again, huh?|||CC|Say again, Ron.|||CMP|You don't want to watch me fill the pan again.|||CC|Yes. Roger. Yes, it'll be up before then. We'll watch you fill the pan. We just - while you're taking time wiping it and all that, that's when we - we don't want to use up the film there.|||CMP|Okay. I'm with you. Actually, I've already cleaned out the - the little area there.|||CC|Roger. I've got 1 minute on my timer right now -about 01:27, actually.|||CMP|Oh, thank you.||01 21 32 24|CMP|Well, we'll start at 2 minutes.|||SC|||01 21 33 37|CMP|You're still on the front page with the lineal cell.||01 21 47 50|CMP|Okay, Houston. The DAC is OFF now.|||CC|Roger. DAC OFF.|||CC|Say, Ron.|||CMP|Go ahead, Houston.|||CC|Yes, Ron. If it's not too much bother, it's one of those nice things to have. The PI would like you to take a picture with the - with the 35-millimeter indoor of the orientation of the heat flow as it's mounted. See if you can get that, if it's not too much problem.||||||Tape 32/10|||||CMP|Okay. No problem. Good idea.|||CC|And that should be magazine SS, which is the sar.e one you'll use for - with the ALFMED tomorrow.|||CMP|Affirmative; okay.|||CMP|Okay. I opened the flow about four turns. A little bit is running out - one big bubble in it. And I still have a little bit left over, even though I wiped it out pretty good awhile ago. The meniscus is up to the bottom ring, and I think we put in eight things in there where it's going to try to get the meniscus up to the top baffle. Is that correct?||01 21 49 55|CC|That's correct, Ron.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 33/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||01 21 51 17|CMP|There must have been a few more bubbles down in there again. That was two turns now, and I've got it about half full all the way across.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|But, maybe there's just about eight or 10 bubbles in it.||01 21 52 36|CMP|That's three turns. The fluid is essentially And we're still going on the first - fourth, so for turn now, and it's still develops a meniscus around the lower baffle - the smaller baffle.||01 21 54 58|CMP|Okay. Looks like about six of the bubbles have developed into three, for some reason.|||CC|Roger.||01 21 55 57|CMP|Oh-oh. It was doing real well there. Then on seventh turn, a bunch of bubbles came in again.|||CC|Roger.||01 21 57 25|CC|Ron, I might have given you a bad call before. We don't want the DAC on until just before that 2-minute mark here, where just prior to going EXPERIMENT/HEAT SELECT - FLOW PATTERN - LOW. At that point, is where we want the DAC on.|||CMP|Okay. You want the DAC on when it starts heating up.|||CC|That's affirm.||01 21 57 52|CMP|Okay. You, know - I may have lost track of the turns here, but I think we've got 7-1/2 or 6-1/2 turns in here. And it still hasn't overflown that first lower baffle. I've got a tremendous concave - convex surface on the fluid, but it still hasn't broken the meniscus of the first has - baffle.||||||Tape 33/2|||||CC|Roger. We copy that.||01 21 58 57|CMP|Okay. I'm going to go ahead and take it another turn, because it was my understanding we wanted to try to get in the second baffle, anyhow. So, I'm going to take another turn of Krytox and put some more in there.|||CC|That's correct, Ron.||01 21 59 37|CC|Ron, if that - if that doesn't do it, they're saying you might want to take a pencil or something and stir it up a bit and try and break it up from lower baffle into the upper baffle.||01 21 59 51|CMP|(Chuckle) Okay. I'm afraid, I may have it all over the place if I do that, but I'll try it.|||CC|Roger. Very slowly.|||CMP|(Laughter) Right.||01 22 00 56|CC|Ron, just a question while you're watching it here. Do you have any bubbles in the lineal cell?||01 22 02 57|CMP|Yes. This one is going to be interesting. There are about, oh, a dozen, nine to a dozen - small bubbles right next to the inject board and then about the same number right in the center of the convex portion of it.|||CC|Roger, Ron. Did you - we didn't copy your answer to our question about any bubbles in the lineal.||01 22 03 27|CMP|No, I didn't get to your question on that. Ir. the lineal unit there are no bubbles whatsoever.|||CC|Roger. Thank you.||01 22 03 35|CMP|And there might have been very slight movement. Matter of fact, I can see just a very slight movement, even now. The particles, in there, they're still lined up in the YY direction essentially though, although it looks like some of them may have deviated from the front of the lineal unit back toward the center, or toward the back of the lineal unit, as you call it.||||||||Tape 33/3||01 22 04 09|CMP|Well, I missed the 2-minute start time there, but I can keep track of it here.||01 22 04 15|CMP|So we'll start the DAC, and then I'll turn this to LOW at 02:45.||01 22 04 31|CC|Okay. We got a hack on it, Ron. If you started it, we started our clock.|||CMP|Okay. You know, just for future reference here, if we like to do things in zero g and without jarring or jiggle, we want to make sure that the switch actuates with a minimum of pressure.|||CC|Roger, A good point.|||CMP|(Laughter)||01 22 06 17|CMP|Okay. That's just now starting to develop. Look like circular cells, great big ones. And then some of the bigger ones are subdividing now.|||CC|Okay. We got that.||01 22 06 34|CMP|That one's ... Some of them are even getting bigger. One of them is - oh, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and it hasn't divided yet, at all.|||CC|Those are real good comments, Ron. I was in just talking with the experimenters, and if you've got nothing else to do, giving us some sizes of those cells would certainly be very beneficial.|||CMP|Okay.||01 22 07 21|CMP|Okay. Frame 27 was taken at an elapsed time of about 4 minutes.|||CC|Okay. We got that.||01 22 07 42|LMP|Stu, this is Jack. I was taking the pictures. I took four pictures about 20 seconds apart - of the sequence just after he started it. And that ended with - or started with frame 26.||||||Tape 33/4|||||CC|Okay. Frame 26 for 4 seconds - I mean for four frames.||01 22 08 15|CMP|Okay. That one cell I spoke of that was about three-quarters of an inch in diameter now is about an inch long and maybe three-quarters of an inch wide. Each - All of the cells seem to be bigger, in general. They're bigger this time. There is two small ones at about an eighth of an inch and -and along one side. The other one is a half-inch, a half-inch - oh, a quarter of an inch, a halfinch, and then a circular when you get around the outs - out - annulus of the cup. Then you start getting circular sides instead of straight sides. All of the flow comes from the little center spot and flows outward from the center toward the outside of the cells.|||CC|Okay. We - we copy that.||01 22 08 09|CMP|... all of the bubbles have disappeared, except two.||01 22 09 20|CC|Ron, is the smallest cell you see about an eighth of an inch across?||01 22 09 27|CMP|The smalles cell I see is a four-sided one; it looks like a diamond. And it's an eighth of an inch on one side, an eighth of an inch on the other side, and maybe 3/16 on the other two sides.|||CC|Okay. That sounds - that's a good description, Ron. I know on mine some of the smaller ones didn't show up in the - in the film, and we were not - not sure what size they are. So you might, before you quit, bracket the - the smalles or the biggest cells by your estimate of the size.||01 22 11 27|LMP|At any rate, frame number 31, frame number 31||01 22 11 38|CMP|And the information first half of the experiment. The orientation was 90 degrees from this one. (Laughter) In that the lineal cell was on the right, and the lineal cell was aligned with the XX axis.||||||||Tape 33/5|||CC|Okay, Ron. We got - We had a drop in our signal strength there, and we did get your last comment about the orientation. We missed some comment about the frame numbers; I think came from Jack.||01 22 12 15|CMP|Okay. Something's a little different on this one here. Right at the top of the flow circle, it looks just like a finger. It's a curved surface that goes out and almost touches the - the circumference of the dish. And it looks just like if you're holding your finger up and looking at it. It's that type of a shape to it. It comes back down, and it's about a half an inch wide. The flow again emanates from a source that is almost on the fingertip, you might say.|||CC|Okay. We copy.||01 22 13 11|CMP|Okay. Somehow, that fingertip finally touched the complete circumference, and the tip of the finger disappeared.|||CC|Okay.||01 22 13 24|CMP|Okay. My - my small one-eighth inch - or one-eighth of an inch sided diamond joined with another one, now, and one side of the diamond is gone. I still have three sides of the diamond and the fourth side of the diamond, or the upper right-hand corner of the diamond, you might say, has disappeared and goes on with another little square - or rectangle. One - one end of the rectangle is about 3/l6 of an inch long; the other two sides are about three-eights of ar. inch long.||01 22 l4 07|CC|Ron, what's the location of that - of that diamond and rectangle in the - in the circular dish? And is it near the edge, or is it towards the center?||01 22 14 18|CMP|There are almost - No, it's almost in the center. Towards the center. Almost in the center. On the left edge, as you look at the piece of equipment , as you're looking at it, there are absolutely no patterns at all. There Is a flow. You can see||||||Tape 33/6||||||a stream of flow. Whoops. I can get up then and start looking at it. I blew on it when I was talking. You can see a stream of flow from the circumference in toward the outer group of cells. The outer group of cells is at least half an inch from the circumference, though, at that point.|||CC|Okay, Ron. We copy all that.||01 22 15 20|CMP|Yes. I think there is a general migration of - of the cells. Kind of toward the bottom of the circle, if you want to look at it that way. They seem to be stretching kind of in that direction, too.||01 22 15 42|CC|Okay. You're saying that's toward minus X?||01 22 15 45|CMP|... No, toward the plus Y, as you're looking at it.|||CC|Okay. They're migrating toward plus Y.|||CMP|I'll - I'll try to make all directions, with respect to - with respect to the right-side-up of the equipment, you know.|||CC|Okay. We've got you.||01 22 16 06|CMP|And the first finger I talked about was at 12 o'clock. It has joined the edge now and almost disappeared. The second finger was - still essentially the way it was - is getting slightly closer to the edge. There's maybe - oh, less than 1/32 of an inch between the tip of the finger and the edge. And it goes out at - at 2 o'clock. Okay, from 3 o'clock on around to about 7 o'clock, the cells - It's in a shadow, and I can't see for sure if they're touching the edge or not, but it looks like they're probably essentially touching - the sk - the edge.|||CC|Okay.||01 22 16 58|CMP|And then from 7 o'clock on around to 12 o'clock again, none of the cells are touching the edge at all. And they're - oh, an average of three-eighths of an inch from the outside circumference.||||||||Tape 33/7|||CC|Okay. We're getting all that, Ron.||01 22 18 03|CC|And, Ron, we'd like to verify that the fluid is||01 22 18 11|CMP|up to the second baffle. That's verified. It's up to the second baffle.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|All I had to do was start it in one position, and as soon as I started it - started it in one position, it whipped all the way around it. From the point I started it, it went all the way around in both directions.||01 22 18 28|CC|Okay. That sounds beautiful. That ought to be a good data point for something.|||CMP|Yes. Right.||01 22 18 38|CMP|I think that in the low flow here evidently things are even a little bit slower than they were in the high rate - in the high - in the high heat rate. But my little diamond, now, is almost joined with the rectangle. And I think given half a chance, it's tending to go into another fivesided figure.|||CC|Okay. We copy.||01 22 20 44|CMP|And we start to cool down ...||01 22 21 14|CMP|Okay. As we're cooling down, the flow patterns tend to join together, so far. The ones on the outer periphery dissolve into straight liner,. Straight lines are emanating in a radial direction from the center of the circle.||01 22 24 12|CMP|And, Houston, if you're listening; or DSE if you're listening. Had a little bit of film -oop, there's the end of film right now. May as well stop It. Hey, I went to HIGH for a little ways.||||||Tape 33/8|||||CC|Okay, Ron. You came back in; I didn't get all of that. Understand you ran out of film. And say the other.||01 22 24 36|CMP|Well, I still had a little bit of film when the cooldown - the 2-minute cooldown period was left, so I went back to HIGH on the FLOW PATTERN just to see what would happen. And it looked like they were starting out with - again larger-sized cells developing into smaller ones. And, initially, all of the cells were about a half an inch in diameter, and they were closer to the periphery of the dish than they were in the LOW FLOW position.|||CC|Okay. We copy that, Ron. After - after you went to HIGH - after the 19 minutes - how long was it before you started seeing a change?|||CMP|It was within a minute there. See, it cooled down fairly rapidly at the end of the 2 minutes. All of the cells had essentially dissolved. You had some radial lines on the outer perim - The cells that were on the outer side degraded into a strictly radial lines, back to the second row of cells. The row of cells that were on the inside kind of joined together and all ended up into one or two large cells about an inch - or about 3-3/4 of an inch across.|||CC|Okay. Sounds like real good data - -||01 22 26 21|CMP|Still got the HIGH going.||01 22 27 42|CMP|I still have it in HIGH, and the pattern that's developing is almost Identical to the - what was happening in the LOW except it seems to be happening at a faster rate.|||CC|Okay. We copy that.||01 22 20 01|CMP|... triangle or a little diamond developed down there and then - and it disappeared. Only this time, it kind of joined with a different little cell, but it was the same cell next to it. I still have the big one. It's about an inch long -at 11 o'clock - as I had before. I still have a||||||||Tape 33/9||||finger that's developing about 12 o'clock, and another one about 2 o'clock. And they seem to be migrating again toward the bottom of the dish.||01 22 29 57|CC|Okay, Ron. It sounds like you've really wired that experiment in great shape, and all the - and everybody's real happy with the - with the data. I guess now you might as well tear it down and press ahead.||01 22 31 33|CC|Okay, Ron. We're back with you now, and everybody's real happy about the data and experiment. And it looks like you did a super job, and you might as well tear it down and press ahead.||01 22 31 48|CMP|Okay. I still got it in HIGH, and I'm kind of sucking the fluid back down the - the intake. And as I get the fluid thinned out, low and behold there's a whole bunch of bubbles underneath there. And each bubble Is a source for one of those little cells. It's the internal source.|||CC|Okay, Ron. We got that. You may have made a breakthrough for science.|||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.|||CC|17, Houston.|||CMP|17, go ahead.||01 22 34 14|CC|Ron, just a reminder that we're scratching that page 3-45 that - from 46 to 47 - that's scratched out. And from then on all the times, you just subtract an hour from it, if you haven't done that already.|||CMP|Let's see. Yes, we've already done that, Bob. Thank you.|||CC|Roger. Just a reminder on that. And EECOM is over here trying to figure out if you changed the canister or not. Just a reminder on that one.||||||Tape 33/10|||||CMP|Okay. We'll get that as soon as I get this out of the way. Okay?||01 22 34 47|CC|Sure. While you're back there - Panel 100 and that - you might park the optics. We see they're not in zero.|||CMP|Okay.|||CC|And along that same line, Ron, we did notice several times while people were watching through the optics that they went to ZERO. And it's no problem if the rates are low, but just a reminder that we don't want to bump them into the stops with any kind of a rate.|||CMP|Yes. I concur with that, Bob. I guess I didn't realize we were doing that.|||CC|We just picked up some data points down here that people - You were all looking around, I guess, and you might - It's easy to miss that TRUNNION going to ZERO, I guess.|||LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead, Jack, or Gene.|||LMP|I'm ready to update your weather in the Western Pacific, if you're interested.|||CC|Roger. Go ahead.||01 22 36 07|LMP|Still can't quite figure out what that circulation around New Zealand means. It looks like it's merging with some more weather to the southeast. I suspect it's stormy there, but I still -It's not a terribly well-developed storm, although it seems to be broadening in its extent. Australia is completely free of any significant weather and almost completely free - free of clouds. The - There appears to be a front - although right now it does not look too intense - approaching from the southwest. And it looks like it's about 5 degrees of longitude south of the southwestern tip of Australia. The typhoon Cirrus - or Therese, I guess it is - appears to be just about the same position it was yesterday. And that is north of Borneo and between Vietnam and the Philippines.||||||||Tape 33/11|||CC|Roger. We see that on the prog here, Jack.||01 22 37 39|LMP|Okay - -||01 22 40 02|CC|Jack, we've been out of comm here - ... we've missed any of your last report here!||01 22 4l 37|CC|Ron, did you ever get your P23 data from today.|||CMP|That's negative; never did.|||CC|Okay. Just got some updating information for you, if you want to listen to it. I don't think you need to copy it down.|||CMP|Very good. Go ahead.||01 22 4l 56|CC|Okay, Ron, the effective horizon was 25, plus or minus 6 nautical miles, which is real fine. The substellar pointing error was 1 arc-minute, plus or minus 1 arc-minute, which is less than the 1-SIGMA error. The marking data was extremely consistent, and all techniques and procedures were excellent. And the horizon updates from the current onboard value of 28 - is not required, so you're extremely good P23. Outstanding.|||CMP|Hey, that's good to hear. Great. Thank you.|||CC|And I do have one input from your other half. There's a concern that if you spill grape juice on your flight suit, it's hard to get out. So be sure - and when you're eating - drinking grape juice - you want to make sure you learn to drink it right.||01 22 42 55|CMP|(Chuckle) Okay. We - we'll try that, for sure.||||Note: During the period 01:22:45:55 to 01:22:54:12, time-annotated recordings are not available.|||CC|Ron, this is Houston. We'd like to confirm the tunnel index angle - that's a positive plus 1.2, is that right?||||||Tape 33/12|||||CMP|Stand by. I don't believe it yet. I want to check it myself. Yes, Gordo, that's what I read, but I figure it's his privilege.|||CMP|I was checking for any scratches on the drogue, but it doesn't look like there is any on there.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|See ...|||CMP|Okay, Houston. The roll docking index is on a 1.2 - a plus - 1, a plus 1.2.|||CC|Roger. Plus 1.2.|||CMP|'And - let's take a look up there in the docking latch number 4. The bungee is parallel. Roger. Bungee is parallel, but it's not fully extended. You look down in the end of it and - you know -and it's not fully extended. And - and the -capture - the docking latch itself or the docking lever is loose on the docking ring. So, it looks like to me that's when I ought to recock and fire it again.|||CC|Okay. We copy that, Ron. Stand by.|||CC|Ron, can you estimate in inches how far down the bungee piston is?|||CMP|Yes, it's down about a half an inch.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|And - a - when I take the - and move the handle back aw ays and I can take the - hook. There I did it ... I took the hook and I pulled it back off the docking ring and then it caught again, so now it won't go back over the docking ring. Maybe - I just lifted the hook off the docking ring with my finger.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 33/13|||CC|Say, Ron, I would like to caution you again, sticking your finger around or under that hook - there may still be some spring energy stored up there that could release.|||CMP|Oh, you bet you. Yes, I know that. No, I was just touching the top of the hook when I pulled it back off the docking ring. I'm pulling back onto the docking ring, and it looks like it's back in the cocked position now.|||CC|Okay. I think we've got the picture.|||CMP|Do you want me to open the hatch here, Jack, or do you want to - while they're thinking about that I'll get out of the way and come on and open the hatch.|||CMP|(Laughter) Can't get up and can't get down -Okay - -|||CC|We're having a long conversation about that latch, Ron. Why don't you all just press on down the checklist and leave it as it is while we think about it?|||CMP|Okay. That's what we're doing here Gordo.|||CMP|Okay, Gordo, do you want the 02 HEATERS 1 and 2, OFF, and 3, AUTO? That's what you've got.|||CC|Yes, that's fine.|||CMP|Okay. He's going to open the hatch and IVT. Gordo, let me tell you a little more on that docking latch. When I looked at it, of course, my handle was flush against the edge and it was also - essentially - locked in position. But since the bungee was down on the thing I took hold of it, and I felt that the hook itself was loose. Okay, so I took the handle and the handle will come back - would come back once you pressed the little button, you know, to release the handle. The handle would come back to about a 45-degree position just like it normally does when you try||||||Tape 33/14||||||to cock the latches. Okay, with the handle back in that 45-degree position, then I grabbed hold of the hook and brought the hook off of the docking ring with my finger and back to about that 45-degree position again just like it was comparable to the first cocked position. And that's the way it is right now.|||CC|Okay, Ron.|||LMP|Okay. One piece of tape coming up shortly, provided I can find the tape. Here it is. Okay, Gordo, I'm running up through the tunnel from America to Challenger.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Piece of tape coming up. I'll tell you, Gordo, it's remarkably clean up here. It doesn't look like the snowstorm that I remember coming into last time.|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||LMP|... up here. Hey, you did a good job, friend. Hey, that's good. Where is it? Oh, you straight out there? Let me see; I want to see. I want to take a look at it, too. Hey, there it is; sticking straight out. Okay, Houston, America has a VHF antenna - looks deployed perfectly.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|... upside down In there. ... The commander's window has a slight amount of condensation on the lower left edge - that's the left-hand edge, really. It seems to be just there when the Sun warms the window.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||SC|Okay, Houston. 74 on 1-3.|||CC|Okay.||||||||Tape 33/15|||LMP|Geez, what was that? What was that from? What the heck is this?|||CC|Sounds like the cabin ... is working up there.|||LMP|Holy smole. ... Sun's out - there's Sun out in the AOT.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|Okay. I'm looking out the AOT, and I see a VHF antenna and part of a umbra radar antenna in position 1. Position 2 looks right in the radar antenna, and, as I said yesterday, it was beautiful.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Position 3, I see the other side of America and very, very clean air, very clean. Okay, I got a good view of the side of the service module, and you can see these little blisters in the side of the covering there quite distinctly. I think people were talking about those before.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Yes, I take that back. That's the side of -that's the side of the command module we're looking at that has the little blisters on it. Got to get oriented up here. Got a great view of the hatch - you ... watch your eyes and everything. Look up, rather than into the Sun ...|||SC|Okay. Step 1 on 1-4.|||SC|Okay, Gordy. The LMP OPS is 6100 psi, 6100.|||CC|Roger.|||SC|And the CDR OPS is 5900, that's five-nine-zero-zero .|||CC|Okay.|||SC|Okay. Zip bag coming up.||||||Tape 33/16|||||SC|You won't scare me any more if I come on up here with you, will you? (Laughter).|||SC|I got to go back in there.|||SC|Okay.|||SC|Yes. Do you want to stack part of it over there?|||SC|No, wait a minute. There's strips of the stuff, you know, I'll just give you a strip of it. Take it over there.|||SC|Okay. Here you go. That's ... of them is that enough?|||sc|Yes, go ahead, Jack. Yes, in the tunnel. What do you need.|||SC|Okay.|||SC|Okay.|||SC|Checking circuit breakers now, Gordy.|||CC|Roger.|||SC|... both circuit breaker panels were as advertised, Gordy.|||CC|Okay.||01 22 54 12|LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead. 17, Houston. Go ahead.||01 22 54 22|LMP|I need to make a correction. Roger. I need to make a correction. It looks as if that storm area that was in New Zealand yesterday has moved up across the two islands and is now sitting northwest. Jt's getting a little hard to identify the smaller islands in the pacific, but - pretty sure I've got it in the right place now looking at the map. And it is northwest of New Zealand. And it looks like New Zealand is probably having reasonably good weather today, although I suspect it rained last night.||||||||Tape 33/17|||CC|Roger, Jack. That's interesting because on my prog it doesn't show a thing down that area. This just may not be up to date here yet.||01 22 55 43|LMP|Well, there may be nothing down there except some cloud patterns and - but that's all I can see, of course. The front that's south of Australia now - I presume front - just looking at a fairly well-developed, although narrow, cloud line, is about 5 - about 10 degrees south of Perth right now, southwest of Perth and runs on a northwest-southeast line - over to a point about 10 or 15 degrees southwest of Tasmania. And then it intersects a curved front that runs from there up to - to Tasmania, and then back around down south of New Zealand about 10 degrees.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||01 22 56 24|CDR|Say, Bob, this is Gene. I got some new sensors on. You might want to take a look at them.|||CC|Roger. Good show, Gene. We were just wondering about that, and I'll bug the guys on my left here and make sure they're looking at them.||01 22 56 51|CC|We're not getting any data yet, Gene.||01 22 56 55|LMP|Bob, we're starting to get ... from just off Luzon on the northeast trend ,., seen so far a shadow line of fairly thick high clouds overlying some thick lower clouds behind the front.||01 22 57 52|CC|Roger. You might have - be of interest on board there, the FIDOs - -||01 22 58 52|CC|Jack, we've been having comm dropouts here on this OMNI. Have you swing around on us?||01 22 59 06|LMP|Okay. What - where did I leave you, Bob?|||CC|Well, I'm not sure because we picked up a number of different bits, and then we dropped it all.|||LMP|Did you get the overcast over Korea and Manchuria bit?|||CC|Negative. I didn't get that.||||||Tape 33/18||||01 22 59 36|LMP|Okay. That generally - South China looks clear. I haven't had a real good look at it yet, it's out on the limb. It's clearly, however, overcast over Korea and Manchuria. It does not appear to be frontal weather there, though. The dominant front in the northwestern Pacific stretches on a northwest line from just off Luzon on up as far as I can see to the terminator. And it seems to be an extremely strong front with what I would guess is heavy air-mass weather all along it. And up to the east-northeast of Japan, there's an excellent example of a shadow line from some fairly thick high clouds on solid overcast of lower clouds. Don't see any major cyclone development along it, or wave development. It just locks like a very strong air-mass front.|||CC|Roger, Jack. We've got it on our prog here. We don't show the one on the northeast part of Japan, but we do show a front prog for tomorrow morning going off of Taiwan and - right from Taiwan eastward - past the Ryukyu Islands and just on into the northern Pacific there. Looks like pretty heavy cloud mass over there.|||LMP|Roger. That's the one I'm- Roger. That's the one I'm looking at. Extremely heavy. And right now it -in fact starts about at Luzon. It looks like Taiwan is almost on the back side of it.|||CC|Yes. That's what our prog - it shows it right on Luzon and then Taiwan's clear.|||LMP|Very good.|||CC|We'll keep up with you yet there, Jack. Say, you may be interested. We've got 9 hours of good tracking on the - after the midcourse - and we show a perilune of about 52 miles which confirms a good midcourse.|||CDR|Sounds outstanding.|||CMP|'That's great.||01 23 03 05|CDR|You can cross off the canister, by the way; it's changed.||||||||Tape 33/19|||CC|Okay. EECOMs happy about that now, finally. And, Gene - the CD - your data looks good.||01 23 02 19|LMP|Okay. I never had a chance to tell you, Bob, but you - as you see - I presume - I - the LMP no longer has sensors on.|||CC|Roger. We confirm that.|||:^mp|By the way, those were the - I guess you know -the sensors that we put on at the Cape. And they still seemed to be in good shape when I took them off. I figured I'd let things rest a while, and then I'll put them on again tomorrow.||01 23 02 55|CC|Roger. Looks like you've got eat period scheduled here for an hour, and then into the presleep checklist.|||LMP|Whoopee! The old preslip [sic] checklist.||01 23 12 19|CC|Apollo 17, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead, T.P.|||CC|Yes. I was going to say, is that talkative commander on board?|||CC|How are you doing down there?|||CC|Well, I feel lots better. Like I told you, Geno -I think that you were the jinx on Gemini 9 for all the delays. Over.|||CDR|No way; you got a longer history than I do.|||CC|Everything's looking great.|||CDR|Yes, it's looking good on board. We're - I think we're pretty well squared away. We've got our stowage in shape, and we're in the house-cleaning routine. And that's about 50 percent of the battle.|||CC|Right.|||CDR|The weather down there didn't look too good today. How's it been?||||||Tape 33/20|||||CC|Well, as it started out, it was below minimums this morning and finally, this afternoon, it cleared up. But it was strictly zilch this morning and starting last night. There's another front due in here later tonight.|||LMP|Yes, we've been watching that one.|||CC|Well, Jack, you're turning into a very trained weather observer besides being a geologist.|||LMP|Oh, I'm enjoying it immensely, Tom, as you may have gathered.|||CC|Right.|||LMP|Very interesting place to watch; I'll tell you.|||CC|Absolutely superb.||01 23 19 44|CDR|How are things on the home front, T.P.?|||CC|Geneo, things couldn't be better.|||CDR|Well, you might sound all the good words from us.|||CC|Oh, will do. I plan to drop by and bum a cup of coffee tomorrow.|||CDR|I'd love to invite you up here for supper.|||CC|And I wish I could join you. I could make another couple of remarks , but they'd be X-rated; so I shouldn't.|||CDR|Okay. I'll accept that.|||CDR|You notice I haven't yet.||01 23 21 04|CC|(Chuckle) I'm very well pleased, Geneo. Your -your language is superb.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 34/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||01 23 27 37|CC|17, Houston. Just a couple words. We'd like you to know we're real satisfied with all the LM data that we saw during the LM activation work today. And, looking at it, the data looked real good.|||LMP|Great, Bob. I was - you had me worried there for a while with the comm. Do you have a good idea what caused that?|||CC|Yes, we're sure about 99.9 percent of it was just ground linkup.|||LMP|Yes, that's certainly the way it acted onboard.|||CC|I guess there won't be any need to go back and change the Checklist on that, but there's a lot to be said for maybe going to a real good stable condition and then getting a good firm checkout before you go into that downvoi ce backup mode and things like that. And I think that's what we'll do in the future.||01 23 28 35|LMP|Understand.||01 23 45 50|LMP|Houston; 7 - 17|||CC|Go ahead, Jack.|||LMP|Say, I'm just a little curious about the difficulty on holding the omnis. Is that about the same as past missions, or are we losing a little bit more than usual?|||CC|We're going to have Ed here give us a description for a minute, so let me stand by.|||LMP|Okay.|||CC|Jack, according to that - to our stalwart INCO over there, due to this new 210 down at Tidbinbilla we're holding actually longer than in the past history.||||||Tape 34/2|||||LMP|Okay. I just guess I've never been on this end before.|||CC|Roger. Do you - do you hear it onboard when we break lock there?|||LMP|Yes, matter of fact, with our SQUELCH ENABLED, we lose all the background noise. And we know when we're picking you up because we start to get background noise again.|||CC|Roger. In other words, you - you are able to stop talking or something when you - when you know we're breaking lock then?|||LMP|Well, if we happen to be talking when you break lock - no, unless we're watching the meters we won't. We lose you when you get about 55 - say 60 percent signal strength. And apparently we're not talking to you when we have less than that.|||CC|Roger. Yes, INCO gave me a briefing tonight and showed me what chart to watch so I can look at numbers when to talk. I've been talking to myself too much, lately.||01 23 48 09|LMP|Yes, they have a beautiful chart there for that purpose.|||CC|I never really wanted to be an INCO, but I guess I was forced to tonight.|||LMP|There are lots of comments for that one, Bob; but I'd better not say anything.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|You'd never speak to me again.|||CC|Well, that's all right. We can't X-rate the transcripts, so we'll just have to take - take it easy.|||LMP|Say, Bob, I've got another question about the Challenger.|||CC|Go ahead, sir.||||||||Tape 34/3|||LMP|(Music) Yes, sir. The battery voltage on low taps, strangely enough, was just like the simulator; but I had expected that the simulator might have been wrong - that we would have seen higher voltage there. Is that - is that about what you guys expected?|||CC|Roger. They said they expected that because the extra time on the pad that they're running. That 2-hour-and-40-minute delay is coming into play again.|||LMP|Oh, yes, yes. That's right. Good. I forgot all about that. Something made that slip my mind.|||CC|Well, things have been going so well that I can't blame you forgetting that.|||LMP|... Stanley Holloway's crazy Flight Plan updates that we've just forgotten that we were ever late.|||CC|Roger. Say, by the way, we like the music in the background. Sounds pretty good.|||LMP|Yes, we sort of - didn't - we didn't get it out at all until today. [Music: Whipped Cream by A1 Hirt] I don't know whether we forgot about it or too many other learning things going on. It's -it's quite pleasant.|||CC|Roger. I don't think you forgot about it. I think you were just glued to those windows.||01 23 50 32|LMP|Well, I still am, as a matter of fact. The old Earth's coming by. And, say, I mentioned a couple of fronts that joined together about 20 degrees south of - of - the south coast of Australia. And it looks like that's a fairly healthy storm center developing down in there - conceivably may migrate up across Tasmania and maybe up - up the Sydney-Brisbane coastal area in the next few days.|||CC|Roger. Where is the exact center of that, Jack? It took me a second to get my prog out here.||||||Tape 34/4|||||LMP|Well, just a second. Let me give you better from the map.||01 23 51 20|CC|Roger.|||CC|While you're looking at your map, I just might mention to Gene. I just talked to your - your better half over there, and everybody's fine and happy.|||CDR|Great. Always like to hear news like that, Bob.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Bob, did you get that - 15 to 20 degrees south southwest of Adelaide?||01 23 52 45|CC|Roger.||01 23 53 21|CC|17, Houston. Are you into your pre - presleep checklist yet?|||CC|17, Houston. Are you into your ...|||CC|17, Houston. Are you into your presleep checklist now?|||CDR|We're just about ready to get started, Bob. We're running a little bit behind, but - we'll catch up here.|||CC|Okay. No sweat.|||LMP|(Music) Trying to get some more of this good food down.|||CC|Roger. Keep saying those words. The people on my left appreciate that.|||CDR|Yes, but it does take awhile.|||CC|I'm sure of that.|||LMP|You know what we really need is Rita to fix it for us.|||CC|That's affirmed. I'll go along on that.||||||||Tape 34/5||01 23 56 19|CDR|Okay, Bob, I'm going to cycle H FANS 1 and 2.||01 23 56 25|CC|Okay, we're watching.||01 23 57 50|CDR|FANS are OFF.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Bob, we're still on November November frame 140, and I'm going to take two more pictures before I go to sleep.|||CC|Roger, Jack. We copy that. November November frame 140. And you ought to be on 142 when you go to sleep, I guess, huh?||01 23 59 37|LMP|That's affirm.||02 00 l4 48|LMP|Houston, 17-|||CC|Go ahead.|||LMP|Roger. One final word. I got those pictures; and, I tell you, that typhoon off - north of Borneo - looks like it's right off the coast of -the east coast of Vietnam now. And it's about as tightly organized and solid as anything I can remember seeing in photographs. It looks as if, from yesterday, it's moved quite a bit to the west.|||CC|Roger. We concur. The prog for 12:00 - Let's see, that's about 6 hours from now - shows it to be right over the Vietnam area, the Viet - Vietnam peninsula there. So it looks like it's moving the way they're progging it, huh?|||LMP|Yes; well, it's right there. Yes, it certainly is. It's - it's moved from just a little bit west of Luzon over to the coast there. So it's a pretty healthy storm.|||CC|Roger. It looks - on the prog chart here - it looks real tight. It's a very - very centralized thing and real tight circular.||||||Tape 34/6|||||LMP|Oh, yes, you better believe it. It in really -it is tight. It - it's really - really no bigger than the - in terms of cloud pattern - no bigger than the - say, South Vietnam itself.|||CC|Roger. How're you getting that, Jack? Are you looking with the monocular now?|||LMP|That's affirm. Monocular still gives real good resolution on the cloud patterns. [Music] Naked eye, you just see the masses; but with the 10-power monocular, it's perfectly adequate for seeing the kind of patterns we're talking about.||02 00 17 02|CC|Roger.

I don't think any of us are real sleepy right now, but we're going to give her the old space try, here; and I'm sure we'll be asleep before long. Ron is on watch; and, if you don't wake him up with your voice, give him a crew alert. He says he'll wake up with a MASTER ALARM.||02 00 30 00|CC|That's a healthy sign.

I'll be around for 8 hours anyway.|||CDR|What's your expected GET of awake?|||CC|Stand by, Okay, 17, it should say 56 - -|||CDR|... 56.|||CC|Go ahead.|||CDR|Yes, we're just going to say the same thing.|||CC|Okay. Should show 56 on your clock.|||CC|In fact, Dr. Kranz, here, just decided that you guys get another half hour in the morning if you wanted it. But you better tell us now because we'll wake you up at 56 and ask you if you want the other half hour then, unless you tell us.|||CDR|Yes, why don't you give us another half hour; and if we happen to wake up and want to move around, well, we'11 do it.||02 00 36 12|CC|Okay; we'11 wake you up at 56:30.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tapes 35-39/1|||APOLLO |17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION ST PERIOD - NO COMMUNICATIONS||||||||Tape 40/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||02 08 35 43||(Music: Jayhawk Fight Song)||02 08 37 00|CC|Good morning, Apollo 17.

That little storm - fairly big storm - that was off the coast of northwest Africa yesterday, has moved inland and presumably is giving those people up there some weather. Might even be getting some snow up in the Atlas Mountains. It's still fairly well organized and inland a few hundred miles - or the edge of it is inland a few hundred miles. The people at the Cape of Good Hope ought to be seeing some clouds that are forerunners of a large circulation system that's south-southwest of them - that, although large, it seems to have most of its heavy clouds to the southeast of the center. And they may not get any major weather out of this one. But they'll probably have cloudiness for a few days. The storm that was over Buenos Aires yesterday has apparently moved out to sea and is now west - or east-southeast of that area. Otherwise the - except for those three storm areas, the South Atlantic looks relatively calm. The zero phase point is now off the - east coast of South America, and it looks fairly dull and gray. And I suspect no extensive choppiness in that area.||02 10 4l 50|CC|Jack, take a breather there.

It was a United Airlines jet, 6l people aboard. And it crashed into a south-side Chicago neighborhood while trying to land at Midway. Most of the 55 passengers - There were - well, I'm not sure I'm getting all the numbers right here. But it said here that most of the 55 passengers were found dead in the debris of a - and it was a Boeing 737 about a half a mile away from the airport. One of the victims was representative George Collins, a Democrat from Illinois - who was returning from Washington to organize a children's Christmas party. The weather, at the time, was a 500-foot ceiling and 1-mile visibility. And sleet and snow were falling at the time. There were no report that any occupants of the houses were injured or killed. I turn back to the back of the paper, here. A United spokesman said one of the||||||Tape 4l/6||||||six crewmembers, a stewardess, was among l6 persons admitted to Holy Cross Hospital. She said there were two infants among the passengers. Jet apparently missed runway 13 at Midway on - and cruised over the neighborhood of bungalow homes at heights of 500 to 1000 feet and then with his nose up and tail down tore into the dwellings. Witnesses said the plane scraped the roofs of two bungalows and sheared through six houses, setting them aflame. The fuselage of the airliner split, but the nose remained intact. A tail section was sticking out of one house. The plummetting airliner sheared through utility lines and a 2-square-mile area was blacked out. Telephone service was knocked out. A power company spokesman said 5000 homes were affected.|||CDR|Okeydoke.|||CC|And a little news about your trajectory. Since the midcourse 2, you've been looking real good.

And this morning, it's probably in the 60s somewhere.||02 11 11 20|LMP|Makes it - -||||||||Tape 41/7||02 11 18 33|CC|17, Houston. I have some words about the troubles we had during the LM comm checks yesterday, if you have a free moment to listen.|||CDR|Go ahead, Gordy. We're listening.|||CC|Okay. We think we've got a pretty good handle on what the problem was - and that was, that the -the LM communications gear, we think, was jumping on the voice subcarrier, rather than the main carrier. And the symptoms that we had point to that. What would happen is, when I would try to transmit, then it would lose lock as soon as I put modulation on the voice subcarrier. During the checks today, we're going to try to verify that the system is indeed working okay. And we can do it without any changes in the onboard procedures by - purely by procedures that will be handled at the ground site and here at Mission Control. And so that's what we're planning to do. We really don't - The problem that happened has been seen before, evidently; and it's not that unusual. We really don't think there's anything wrong with the onboard equipment. Over.|||LMP|Sounds good, Gordy. We'll just take her slow and easy when I get over there today and make sure we understand it.|||CC|Okay, Jack.

And, Gordy, different than the last time - the charger amps is moving up very slowly. Started out at about 0.02 and now is 1 amp - little more - It's still going up. Before, it jumped right up to about 2 amps. Is that expected?|||CC|Oh ... we'll check on that. Stand by.|||CDR|Gordy, the LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.6. You still want us to take the command module up?|||CC|Geno, that'll be fine.

And we'll try the drogue now.|||CC|Okay, Ron.||02 11 57 50|CDR|Okay, the - the drogue is out, and we're going up to take another look at Challenger.||||||Tape 42/2|||||CC|Okay, Gene.||02 11 59 30|LMP|Somebody left their lights on in here.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|It's just like a refrigerator.|||CC|Roger.||02 12 00 36|LMP|Docking index is unchanged.|||CC|Okay. It's a plus 1.2. Right?||02 12 00 44|LMP|That's affirm.||02 12 03 17|CC|Ron, Houston. Over.|||CMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay, Ron. When you get a - a moment, when it's convenient, we'd like you to go up to the latch number 4 there, the one that's been giving us trouble, and we'd like you - well, we think it's just half cocked and we'd like you to stroke it. We think it will probably cock on one - with one more stroke. We'd like you to stroke it at least twice more to verify that it is really cocked. And as you do stroke the handle, we'd like you to notice approximately what point in the - in the throw that the resistance increases. I think that summarizes what we want you to do, if you keep us advised as you go along.|||CMP|Okay.|||CC|We - we're going to leave it cocked then from here cm until redocking after rendezvous. Well - we don't want to - we don't want you to fire it.|||CMP|Sure. Understand.||02 12 05 08|LMP|Houston, we're transferring to IM power.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Okay, Houston. I'm going to give them LM POWER. I'm going to go RESET and OFF.||||||||Tape 42/3||02 12 05 21|LMP|And we have LM power.|||CC|Roger.||02 12 05 49|CDR|Gordo, this is Geno.|||CC|Go ahead, Gene.||02 12 05 54|CDR|Okay. While my compatriots are carrying out their respective tasks, I'm going to go off the air here for a - a few short minutes. And give you a call when I get back.|||CC|Okay.||02 12 06 12|LMP|And I'm in step 3, Gordy, on 2-2.|||CC|Roger.||02 12 07 25|CMP|Okay, Houston. America here. I'm on nor docking latch number 4 now.|||CC|Okay, Ron.||02 12 07 50|CMP|Okay, the handle itself is free swinging at - to a point about 1 inch beyond the backside of the J-hook.|||CC|Roger.||02 12 08 10|CMP|And, I'll go ahead and try to cock it now.||02 12 08 21|LMP|Gordy, ED BATs are 37*2 and 37.2, and the BUS VOLTAGES are 26.2 and I'll bring on the high taps.|||CC|Okay, Jack. Sounds good.||02 12 08 42|CMP|And, Houston, as we all suspected, it has one cock on it, or it had one cock. Now it's fully cocked. And the handle itself is free swinging. The plunger has depressed, oh, almost three-quarters of an inch from the top. And it is no longer parallel with the surface.|||CC|Roger, Ron.||||||Tape 42/4||||02 12 09 19|CMP|Okay. When you look back in the side of it there, that little J-hodk with the snowman in it, the snowman's head points - as you look directly at the side of it, it points - the snowman's head is at 8 o'clock and the connecting link from the one that connects - the one that goes into the plunger to - to the little fat J-bar there, is parallel with that slot, so that the point of the J sticks out. So it is, indeed, fully cocked.|||CC|Okay, Ron. Sounds good and that's where we'd like to leave it.|||CMP|Okay. Will do.||02 12 10 20|LMP|Okay. Step 5 2-3*|||CC|Roger.||02 12 11 21|LMP|Okay, Houston. Step 5 couplete. Glycol pressure is 21. It's down about a psi from yesterday.|||CC|Okay, Jack. Copy.||02 12 11 32|CMP|And, Houston, is magazine II a good one to use for a - some opportunity interior photos?|||CC|Let me check, Ran.||02 12 11 56|CC|That's affirm; II sounds good.|||CMP|Hope so. Looks like that's the only one I have.|||CC|Do you - do you recall when you did the heat flow on HH, if you used all of HH up on that experiment?|||CC|Don't get it out to look, but I just wondered if you remembered.|||CMP|... No, it ran out. It didn't - I got the complete cooldown part of the ex - of the experiment on HH and then switched to HIGH. And I got about 2 minutes of HIGH before the film ran out again. Had that at HIGH power on the - on the - -|||CC|Okay, Ron. Thank you.||||||||Tape 42/5|||CMP|After the main part of the experiment was complete.|||CC|Roger.|||CC|And, Jack, we're copying LM data now.||02 12 13 02|LMP|Okay, Gordy. Beautiful. I was just going to say step 6 is complete.||02 12 16 45|LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead.|||LMP|Roger. I just was thinking while I was waiting here that the cleanliness of these two spacecraft is certainly a tribute to the - all the people at Grumman and Downey and at the Cape, who worked so hard to put them that way.|||CC|Okay. We'll make sure they hear about it.||02 12 19 31|CC|Challenger, Houston. We're - we've looked at the LM data and it looks perfect, no problems at all. What we're doing right now, though, is - is - the checkout on the carrier and subcarrier lockups on the LM comm. So far, we've had no trouble with it, but we haven't quite completed the routine we wanted to try. Over.|||LMP|Okay. I understand, Gordy. No - no hurry here.||02 12 25 34|CC|Okay, Jack. We've completed our investigation of the comm, there. It all looked good. You can press on page 2-4.|||LMP|Roger.||02 12 27 13|LMP|Say, Gordy, I see I neglected to pull the BAL LOAD circuit breaker when I went to - after going to high taps. You want me to go back and show you that again?|||CC|Stand by.||02 12 27 36|LMP|That's the BAL LOADs breaker on 16, so the buses were tied together.||||||Tape 42/6|||||CC|Roger. I understand.||02 12 27 50|CC|Jack, there's no need to go back. Just keep on going.|||LMP|Okay. Sorry about that.|||CC|No problem.||02 12 31 42|CC|America, Houston. We're all ready for the E-MOD dump, if it's convenient to you.||02 12 32 18|CMP|Houston, this is America. I guess that's for me, isn't it?|||CC|That's right, for Captain America.|||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. We'll get her here.||02 12 32 39|CMP|Okay, VERB 74 ENTER.||02 12 32 44|CC|Okay, we're getting it.|||CMP|Okay.||02 12 33 11|CMP|And, Houston, we have 50 percent remaining on magazine India India.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|And they're all taken at 6 frames a second.|||CC|Okay.||02 12 33 54|CC|Okay, America, we've got the dump.||02 12 34 05|CMP|Okay. Understand; you have the dump.||02 12 37 35|CDR|Hello, Gordo. This is Geno. I'm - back on the line.|||CC|Okay. Welcome back.|||CDR|Yes, I was just testing out the survival techniques in space.|||CC|Roger. Did you survive?||||||||Tape 42/7|||CDR|Well, so far.||02 12 38 00|CDR|And we've got the IM back on CSM power.|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|Gordo, it's called education of necessity.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Okay. I guess the LM looked pretty good to you, huh?|||CC|Yes, sir. It looked perfect. And we also went through the little communications main carrier sub carrier lockup check, and the - and the comm system worked perfectly, so there's no problems at all to report.||02 12 39 07|CDR|Okay, fine. We'll start in - with the - Jack donning the PGA, and then I'll follow him.|||CC|Okay.||02 12 40 38|LMP|Gordy, how'd that ZPN turn out?|||CC|Let me get another check, here.||02 12 4l 21|CC|Okay, Jack. It looks fairly good right now. Don't bother changing anything.|||LMP|Well, I'm just going to be in a position to work on it in a little while and if the occasion arises, I could.|||CC|Okay, we'll keep that in mind, although it looks reasonable at the moment. It has shown some -at some times, it's gone to - from edge to edge on their scale but it's come back in right. Find out later if they want to do anything.||02 12 42 00|LMP|Okay, the - the electrolyte pads may be still expanding a little bit so I'm going off the air briefly to start getting into the suit. And I'll talk to you in a little while.|||CC|Okay.||||||Tape 42/8||||02 12 53 48|CDR|Hello, Gordo.|||CC|Hello.||02 12 53 57|CDR|Okay. We're up to frame count 151 on magazine November November. They've been pictures of the -primarily of the CSM out the LM windows by the CMP.|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|He's been up there fooling around for a while. We may have to check it out and see what he did.||02 12 57 42|CC|America, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead, Gordo.|||CC|That dropout there was because Ascension had a problem. We're now over on Madrid, and you're sounding good.||02 12 57 59|CDR|Okay.||02 13 01 14|CDR|Okay, Gordo. Jack is in his suit, unzipped at this time. I'm going off the air, and Ron will come on and keep you informed as to how we're going.|||CC|Okay. Fine.||02 13 03 07|LMP|Houston. How do you read the LMP?|||CC|Loud and clear, Jack.||02 13 03 13|LMP|Okay. I'm in ny suit, presently unzipped. Didn't seem to be any problem at all.|||CC|Okay.||02 13 04 07|LMP|And, Gordy, I think I found the problem with the biomed sensors. And when I come out of the suit, I can fix it. I put a little of that bacterial cream on the sensor places last nigjht as a preventive mechanism, and I think it's just a little greasy to hold the sensor.|||CC|Okay.||||||||Tape 42/9||02 13 09 08|CMP|Okay. Gene's got his suit on and he's going across to the LM now.|||CC|Roger, Ren.||02 13 15 26|CMP|Okay. This is CMP. I'll go off the line here, for a little bit, until I can get my suit on again.|||CC|Okay, Ron.|||CMP|And Jack's still on the line up there in the 124 though.|||CC|Okay.||02 13 17 37|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're both zipped now, and it went quite easily.||02 13 17 44|CC|Okay, Jack. Sounds super.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 43/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||02 13 29 37|CMP|... CMP. I finally got my suit on now.|||CC|Go ahead.|||CC|America, Houston. Did you call?|||CMP|No, I was just saying - the CMP. Got my suit on now. And I had a little trouble with the donning liners getting stuck - stuck in the zipper; but I figured out how to get them out of the way now.|||CC|Okay.||02 13 38 40|CMP|Okay, Houston. Gene has his suit pretty well on now.|||CC|Okay, Ron.|||CC|We reviewed the data on the E-MOD. Everything looks normal. One thing you might do is - no big thing, but you might zero NOUN 26. It's still loaded, left over from the EMP you used in the P23 yesterday.|||CMP|Okay. Thank you much.||02 13 39 49|LMP|Gordy, this is the LMP. How do you read?|||CC|Loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|Say, when I was switching batteries, I noticed switching from low to high taps that there were some reverse-current indications. Sure that's nothing to be concerned about; you probably expected those, right?|||CC|That's affirmative, Jack. That's normal.|||LMP|Right.||02 13 55 31|CC|America, Houston. We'd like to terminate the charge on battery B.||||||Tape 43/2|||||CMP|Okay; stand by 1. Okay, we'll get that in a minute, Gordon.|||CC|Okay.||02 13 58 51|CMP|Okay, Gordo, the charge should be terminated on BAT B.|||CC|Okay.||02 13 58 57|CMP|And 7 Alfa's still - 7 Alfa's still 0.6.|||CC|Roger.||02 14 04 03|CDR|Okay, Gordy, I - I'm looking around, but I can't figure out what that MASTER ALARM is. I didn't see any 02 HIGH PLOW and I didn't see any lights, and we did get it down in the LEB.|||CC|Okay, Gene.||02 14 04 20|CDR|And there it is again.|||CC|Roger.||02 14 04 32|CDR|And again.|||CC|Roger.||02 14 04 37|CDR|Okay, I saw SPS PRESSURE blink on that one.|||CC|Roger.||02 14 04 48|CDR|Yes, Gordy, she's triggering continually on SPS PRESSURE.||02 14 05 01|CDR|Yes. I can't reset it, and a minute later she's coming up with a blink on SPS PRESSURE.|||CC|Okay, Gene. We think it's the - well - well, we -we're sure that it's the oxidizer pressure is right on the trip limit. We're almost certain it's due to helium absorption.||02 i4 05 28|CDR|Yes, we're reading 155 right now.||||||||Tape 43/3|||CC|Roger.||02 14 08 28|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We got the SPS PRESSURE light on steady now.|||CC|Roger.||02 l4 15 25|CC|America, Houston. If you give us ACCEPT, we'll give you a new state vector. Nothing much wrong with the one you've got, but we're just going to tweak it up.||02 14 15 36|CDR|Okay, Gordy, you've got it.|||CC|One other question. Do you have the LM closed up now? We're seeing some heater currents that are a little hight indicating maybe the light's still on. And we're just trying to understand where the LM is at the present time.||02 14 16 04|CMP|Okay, I just closed the hatch, just about the time you started talking there.|||CC|Okay, we'll take a look at the currents now.||02 l4 18 03|CC|America, it's your computer, and we did the VERB 66.|||CDR|Okay.||02 14 29 03|CDR|Say, Gordo, what's the trend in thinking on that SPS light - to leave it lit or to bump the pressure up?|||CC|Well, I - Ed Mitchell must be at work, because we were just talking about that subject. I'll call you when they come up with a final decision.||02 14 29 33|CDR|Okay. And Ron has put the - has closed LM hatch. He's put the drogue in. He's put the probe in, and he's putting the CSM hatch in as a one-man exercise - suited. So he's doing the whole thing, and he's still in his suit. Our suits are stowed.|||CC|Okay, Gene. We got one question here, that - just -just waiting for a convenient time to ask, and that was - wondered if, with reference to the||||||Tape 43/4||||||wakeup problems we had this morning, if you'd clarify just exactly why Ron didn't hear our crew-alert MASTER ALARM. You know exactly why?||02 14 30 22|CMP|Well, it's not the Seconal. As much as I hate to admit it, the POWER AUDIO/TONE was OFF (chuckle) in my headset.|||CC|Okay. We kind of suspected that - that one.|||CMP|Okay; that lets you rest a little bit easier. And just to prevent something like that from happening again - or if it should happen again -what we'll do, we'll hook up the tone booster, which we didn't have hooked up last night.|||CC|Okay. We concur. Sounds good.||02 14 31 24|CMP|"Yes. I woke up and I saw that light there and I thought, ""Gee-whiz, I just got it in time.,f Until I tried to push - push out that caution and warning MASTER ALARM. And burned my end of my finger."|||CC|(Laughter)|||CMP|I was also in a sleep restraint and upside down with a zipper in the back. And I had a little problem getting my hands up to start with, also.|||CC|Roger.||02 14 32 40|CMP|Hey, Houston, CABIN REPRESS is back to BOTH now -I mean EMERGENCY CABIN REPRESS.|||CC|Roger, Ron.||02 14 36 20|LMP|Gordo, if you don't have any objections, we'd like to ge ahead and secure the high gain, and go on to PTC while Ron's doffing his PGA.|||CC|Let me check and see if we have any.||02 14 37 21|CC|Sounds good to us. Go ahead and, per Flight Plan, spin it up.|||LMP|Okay.||||||||Tape 43/5||02 14 37 34|CC|Okay, I didn't want to mislead you. I mean, you can get ready to spin it up. We'll give you the GO to spin up.|||LMP|Okay.||02 14 39 06|LMP|Okay, Gordy. You want to leave the high gain until you call?|||CC|Stand by.|||CC|Okay. Jack, this is a good attitude to go to OMNI Bravo, and you can go ahead and secure the high gain.|||LMP|Okay.||02 14 44 45|CC|America, Houston. The rates look good; you're GO for spinup.|||CDR|Okay; great, Gordo; we're GO for spinup. We've -we've got a show in here that very few men have ever seen, and that's a CMP trying to get out of his suit by himself.|||CC|Wish I was there to watch.|||LMP|It really is a story to behold.|||CDR|Needless to say, we're both very impressed.|||CC|I can tell.||02 l4 45 53|CC|America, Houston. Use B/D roll for spinup.|||CDR|Okay.||02 l4 46 31|LMP|Okay, Houston. This is the LMP on biomed. How do you read?|||CC|Okay, Jack. Let's take a point check here.|||CC|America, D-2 ROLL is not on. You need the Delta ROLL jet.||||||Tape 43/6|||||CDR|Yes, I'm still working on it, Gordo. I was just deciding whether to spin minus or plus; but I guess we ought to spin minus, as per the Flight Plan.|||CC|Okay,||02 14 48 l4|CDR|We're on our way.||02 14 48 17|CC|Okay. Okay, - the LMP's EKG and ZPN look good. And on the SPS light, we recommend not doing anything with the system. We want you to go to ACKNOWLEDGE so the - get the light out of your eyes, and then just fly there in ACKNOWLEDGE on the CAUTION and WARNING.||02 14 48 54|CDR|Okay, Gordy. We're in ACKNOWLEDGE, and - I presume, probably after L0I, we'll be able to go back to NORMAL, right?|||CC|That1s affirmative.||02 i4 4g 14|CDR|Is that an abnormal amount of helium ingestion [sic], or do you think that's about right?|||CC|It's - it's absorption, and that's normal.||02 i4 52 06|CDR|Hello, Houston. You read?|||CC|Loud and clear.||02 14 52 12|CDR|Okay, now that we got another look at you, Gordy, it looks like Houston might be right on the fringes of either being clear or clearer. The entire Gulf is pretty nice. Florida looks pretty clear, and Mexico looks pretty clear. There's a big air mass of clouds that looks like it picks up somewhere around the coast at Houston, heads on up north, and then covers most of the Midwest and the East -from about the middle of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia on north. It's clear enough now to even see the coral reefs down off of Florida.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 44/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||02 14 52 54|CDR|And it looks like west Texas is probably also pretty clear, at least in a run from east to west. We can see Baja, and on up the coast of California up north.|||CC|Okay, sounds like the whole crew is turning into weathermen.|||CDR|It's one of the better views we've had of the States, I think, even though we're quite a ways out.|||CC|Roger. Looks like your subso - subspacecraft point is just about at Peru right now.|||CDR|Yes, we're - looks like we're looking straight down on the center of South America, pretty close to what you're saying.|||CDR|Gordy, you want to bring us up to date briefly on how you plan on handling this time update again?|||CC|Okay. I'll do that. Let me - but let me practice before I start here. Just a minute.|||CDR|Okay. I'm primarily interested in those parts of the Flight Plan which we're going to eliminate.||02 l4 55 16|CC|Okay. Just one second.||02 l4 57 33|CC|Geno, I'll read you the PAO release; they summed up pretty well, and I'll just use their words here. The time has been made up in two increments. The first one of 1 hour and 45 minutes in the Flight Plan. The crew activities were jumped ahead by 1 hour, and they essentially began doing those things that were called for 1 hour later in the Flight Plan. They will again jump ahead an hour and 40 minutes, and that will occur at 65 hours. IJy that time they will have completed all those activities required up through 67 hours and 40 minutes in the Flight Plan. Or, in other words, they will have completed all the activities required to get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes||||||Tape 44/2||||||early, and in order to make the clocks then agree with where the crew will be in the Flight Plan, we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. This clock update, which can be likened to going on daylight saving time, only 2 hours and 40 minutes worth of change instead of 1 hour of change as we do on daylight saving time, will occur at 65 hours when the crew will have completed all of those Flight Plan activities up through 67 hours and 40 minutes. (Chuckle) This simply involves setting our clock to 65 hours in the Control Center and aboard the spacecraft to 65 hours, moving them ahead to 67 hours and 40 minutes. Then, barring any further changes in the mission time line, from that point on, the elapsed time clocks, which are used as a cue to Flight Plan activities, should agree with the Flight Plan and events that, in the Flight Plan are called out for a certain time will happen at that time on the elapsed time clocks (laughter) in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. (Laughter) This is a convenience factor.|||CDR|You're lucky; we're going to lose an omni.|||CC|Okay. I'll hold off there for the rest.||02 14 59 26|CDR|Gordy, never mind. I think I got the gist of it.||02 15 04 16|CDR|Did you give up, Gordy?|||CC|Okay. What we're really going to do - (chuckle) really is simple. At 65 hours we're going to do the update of 2 hours and 40 minutes. And the ; procedures are shown in the Flight Plan at 67:35 There just happens - happens to be really no - no activities we have to reschedule in the intervening time. So, after the update is complete, we'll be right on the Flight Plan, both timewise and activ-itywise. Over.|||CDR|Okay. We're looking at it. Going to have to squeeze my shave in somewhere else, I guess.||02 15 07 38|CC|Hey, Gene; Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead.||||||||Tape 44/3|||CC|Hey, you got to break - you can cast the tying vote. Which is the best description: the water bag or the clock one?|||CDR|Oh yes. Now I remember. You got a little - give a little credit on this last one, I guess, to - to Public Affairs, because I don't think Gordo could have thought that one up all by himself.|||CC|Very diplomatic.|||CDR|Considering I - I was trying to do - to do Charlie's technique step by step, I guess I got to give him little bit more credit from the gymnastic point of view.|||LMP|That sounded like one of Gordy's aircraft schedules.||02 15 09 07|CC|Amen.|||CDR|One thing they didn't ... They were moving another Saturn V out on the pad.|||CC|Jack, we lost all of that due to the antenna switch. Say again.|||CC|Jack, we missed your last transmission - -|||CDR|Gordy, you listening?|||CC|- - due to the antenna switch.|||CDR|You say you got it, or you're getting it?|||CC|No, we missed it.|||CDR|Okay. I said you can look right down at the Cape area - that's the Cape that we know - in Florida, and it's little disheartening because the last time I was up here looking back from this angle, they were moving another Saturn V for another Moon trip out on the pad already. But I guess they're working pretty feverishly out there on B.||02 15 11 53|LMP|Gordy, this is Jack. I think Gene was right. You got some - probably scattered cloud weather, but not very far away from you there's a pretty heavy||||||Tape 44/4||||||mass of clouds. It may be the forerunner of that dry cold front you were talking about yesterday, which I can see stretching over into Sonora. But where it hits the stateside, it's got quite a mass of clouds associated with it. It looks like they're moving in your direction.|||CC|Okay, Jack, thanks for the warning.|||LMP|Clear behind it, in Arizona and New Mexico and maybe southern Colorado, it looks like there may be another front stretching, or maybe it hits northern Arizona and Utah and up through northern Colorado, and on in to Canada, trending northeast.|||LMP|You're calling it right on, Jack. I'm looking at the surface chart, and that's about what we see.|||LMP|Looks like a low might be developing on that one -a wave up in northern Colorado and - although the clouds are a little hard to read.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Our sub - or our zero phase point - About 20 degrees west of Bolivia, our sub - our zero - zero phase point, and it is quite a bit brighter than yesterday and looks as if, and more general, as if maybe the seas have picked up In that region a little bit.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|One of the more unusual features is developed - as I see - developed in the southeast Pacific just north of the Ross Sea and that is a very striking mushroom pattern on a very large scale. It has north/south clouds streaming streamers from the Ross Sea. And when it gets up about the latitude of Tierra del Fuego, but quite a bit west of that land, it branches out to the east and west in a large mushroom pattern. And, it looks like the top of that mushroom may be a curved cold front that's pushing its way up into the southeast Pacific. It currently - the eastern edge of that front is probably 10 degrees longitude from Tierra del Fuego, and it looks like that land in southern Chile is picking up high clouds, probably associated with that front's movement.||||||||Tape 44/5|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I'll get some shots of that next time around. That's a spectacular pattern. You almost get the feeling that the cold airmass moving out of Antarctica streams for a while north/south. And then it picks - The cloud patterns change and as it starts to migrate, the winds start to change from east to west, Maybe that's where it encounters the Jetstream.||02 15 16 29|CC|Roger.||02 15 19 45|CC|America, Houston. I have a couple of miscellaneous items here.|||CMP|Okay; go ahead.|||CC|Okay. We'd like you to disable B2 and D2 just for a drill here.|||CDR|Oh, thank you, Gordo.|||CC|Also, the SHe tank looks exactly nominal, as far as the rise rate goes, to us.|||CDR|Can't argue with that.|||CC|And to summarize your film budget situation, have three magazines: KK, LL, and MM are budget for the scheduled photos such that they have only five, 19, and one, respectively, frames left over after you've done a.11 the scheduled pictures. And November November, we think, has just - has just nine frames remaining now. The two nonscheduled magazines are 00 and PP; l6o frames each. Those are the ones provided for optional use. We have 44 additional frames scheduled out of November November, scheduled during lunar orbit. There is only nine left in it now, so we'd like to save at least 60 frames out of either Oscar Oscar or Papa Papa, the two optional magazines, to cover the scheduled frames. Guess what we're saying is there is no problem. We've still got plenty of film, but you will have to use some of your optional mags for scheduled pictures. Sixty frames is what we want to save.||||||Tape 44/6|||||CMP|Okay; mighty fine, Gordo. Plan on Oscar Oscar for that magazine.||02 15 22 12|CC|Okay.||02 15 34 12|LMP|Gordy; this is Jack.|||CC|Go ahead, Jack.|||LMP|I - Cal Tech will never forgive me; I'm a little hesitant on my elementry optics. But I just put Ron's polarizing filter in front of the monocular, looking at the Earth and rotate 90 degrees, and from max to min in terms of brightness, there's a remarkable change. And I suspect that means that the Earth is' polarizing light enough to see it. The main thing that happens is that the oceans get considerably darker when I rotate the filter towards the dark position anyway. The continents don't seem to show any obvious change, but the oceans and the zero phase point darken - oh, I would guess by a factor of two in brightness. Maybe that's an extreme, but I think it's that.|||CC|Roger. I was just trying to think of a reason. Is it uniform change over all ocean areas, or is it more of a change in some areas than others?|||LMP|Well, I'd say that the subsolar point shows the greatest change, but you can still - the zero phase point shows the greatest change. But all the oceans get darker.||02 15 35 51|CC|Very interesting. We are just about to switch omnis.||02 15 42 15|LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead.|||LMP|Gordy, I figure you're getting an optics briefing ready for me, right?|||CC|1 haven't had anybody volunteer one. Strictly some layman theories going around, but nothing official.|||LMP|Okay.||||||||Tape 44/7||02 15 46 05|CC|America, Houston. Just got started on the Cowboy-Redskin game, about 5 minutes into it. The Cowboys are ahead 7 to nothing. They scored the first time they got the ball.|||LMP|Gordy, you started talking before we had an omni. Try it again.|||CC|Okay. The Cowboy-Redskin game just got started. It's now 7 to nothing, Cowboys. They scored the first time they got their hands on the ball.|||LMP|Okay. I think we got most of that. It happened again, though.|||CDR|Did you say it was 7 to nothing, Cowboys?|||CC|That's what I said. They scored the first time they got the ball. It's - the game's just about 5 minutes old.|||CDR|Outstanding. I thought this was Saturday. Isn't -isn't today Saturday?|||CC|It is, but the college is all through, so the pros are playing on Saturday now.|||CDR|Beautiful. Seven to nothing, huh? Go get 'em, Cowboys.|||LMP|But, he would say the same thing for Washington, I'm sure.||02 15 47 45|CDR|Nosiree. Go get 'em, Cowboys.||02 15 48 57|CMP|Houston, 17-|||CC|Go ahead, Ron.|||CMP|Okay, Gordo, tfy apologies on the CMP's insuit drinking bag. There was, in fact, water in it. However, somehow, when we put the suit on, the water bag had gotten turned sideways, I guess, is the way to explain -it. It had gotten turned sideways such that the suction tube was crimped sideways. And, as a result, there was no way that you could get any water to go through the tube.||||||Tape 44/8|||||CC|Okay. You're talking about the problem we had there just before launch, right?|||CMP|That1s affirmative - prelaunch.|||CC|Okay, and for your information, the PTC looks good. It ought to hold.|||CMP|Okay. Mighty fine. I lost my scissors. If there is anything you can do to help me find them, I'd be - appreciate it.|||CC|Okay.||02 15 50 22|CMP|Okay (1aughing).||02 15 52 40|CC|Got a game plan update for you here. It's now 14-nothing, Dallas; still in the first quarter.|||CDR|You're sure a bearer of good news, Gordy. That's great.|||LMP|Gordy, I just - this is Jack. I just tried the red filter on the front of the monocular and about the only major thing I noticed was that the cloud patterns over the landmasses seemed to be enhanced. The contrast between cloud and land, particularly green land is enhanced. Otherwise, all it does is make the red - the Earth look a little red.||02 15 53 37|CC|Roger, Jack.||02 16 04 13|CDR|Hey, Gordo; this is Gene.|||CDR|Hey, Houston; this is 17.|||CC|Roger, Geno. I think we've got you now. Go ahead.|||CC|Okay, Geno. I think we got you - -|||CDR|... 17.|||CC|- - Now. Go ahead.|||CDR|Okay. I just happened to be throwing a few switches, and I see our helium tank temperature on quad A is about 95 or so. And the others are quite low. Is that because of our attitude there during- the LM checkout?||||||||Tape 44/9|||CC|That's affirm. That's the reason.|||CDR|Okay. I also see the tank that - package temperature a little higher on that quad too. But, being close to a hundred it seems a little unusual. You're - you're happy, right?|||CC|That's affirm. No problem. We've been watching it, and it seems to be coming down now.|||CDR|Okay. Fine. Thank you.||02 16 09 07|LMP|Houston, you want the H HEATERS to AUTO and the FAN 3 OFF now?|||CC|Stand by, Jack.|||CC|That's affirmative, Jack. Go ahead.||02 16 09 54|LMP|Okay. That1 s done.|||CC|Now 21 to nothing, Cowboys. Second quarter.|||CDR|Super Bowl, here they come. Watch out now.|||CC|Should remind you that the Commander in Chief is a Redskin fan.|||CDR|I read about that. That's why the Cowboys need as much help as they can get.|||LMP|Gordy, in the continuing saga of looking at the Earth through rose-colored glasses, I tried a blue-colored glass, and it - as you might expect, completely masks out the continent. The land areas are just not visible through the blue. Otherwise, the ocean and clouds - or the contrasting ocean and clouds remain about the same.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|And, Gordy, I tried putting all the filters we had together to check the Sun for sunspots, but just not quite enough light attenuation to do that.|||CC|Okay. For a while I thought you were a human weather satellite. Now I think you're a human Earth resources satellite.||||||Tape 44/10|||||LMP|Well, about all I can say is I'm a satellite I guess.|||LMP|Gordy, it looks as if the distribution of water and ice in the ri - Ross Sea has changed in the last day or two. I don't remember looking at it yesterday specifically, but it seems to be different today than it was the first day.||02 16 12 46|CC|Roger.||02 16 19 53|LMP|Houston, 17*|||CC|Go ahead, Jack.|||LMP|Yes , about this icepack in the Ross Sea. The - as I remember a couple days ago, there were two clear areas, triangular in shape and quite elongate, that were projecting out into the sea from the innermost part of the bay, or the - from the continent. Today those are not apparent, at least the first look I made. And it looks like there is an elongate, more irregular clear area that is roughly parallel to the Antarctic coastline within the sea itself. We'll check that a little more closely and see if that's right.|||CC|Okay. Seems like kind of a quick change for something like ice, doesn't it?|||LMP|Yes , and that's what bothers me. That's why I wonder if I'm not being fooled by cloud patterns or something.||02 16 21 16|CC|I'm looking at a satellite picture here, which I guess is around 12 hours old though. But over to the east of Australia, maybe about a continent width east of Australia, there is really striking long frontal system - striking because it's so long and so straight, sort of west-northwest, trending west-northwest and east-southeast trending. Can you see that?||02 16 23 38|CDR|Gordo, are you there?|||CC|Yes, sir, right here.||||||||Tape 44/11|||CDR|Okay. Now Jack and I may be talking about two different frontal systems or patterns, but the one I think you might be referring to is the one I referred to yesterday as a ruffled parrot's beak. Actually two of them tied together, one starting up probably southeast of Australia and -and then heading down with a long arcing frontal system to another clockwise rotational parrot's -parrot's cone, I should say, down around - near the tip of South America, between it and Antarctica. There is one strong tributary front heading up to the north-northwest from the western side of this big, arcing, frontal mass. And I think that's probably what you're referring to. I'm not sure. I can't quite see Australia coming up over the -over the horizon yet.|||CC|Okay. I - hqt picture cuts off right about the -oh, two-thirds of the way south in Australia, that latitude. So most likely we're talking about the same thing, but I can't verify the southern part of it.||02 16 25 19|CDR|There is some tremendous - western side of that curve front is a tremendous clockwise rotational airmass. It must cover hundreds of square miles. The one down near - near the continent of Antarctica, down there, near the tip of South America, seemed to be squashed slightly as if there is possibly some - some squashing or effect coming off -off the South Pole area near Antarctica. I think, if I turn around and look at it the way Jack was looking at it, it's a cap of a mushroom. Only instead of simply curving in underneath the cap, it has clockwise rotations on both sides as it curves under.|||CC|Roger.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 45/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||02 l6 28 28|LMP|Gordy, I just took two pictures of the Earth at the-present time. And those are - Right now the camera is on frame 153.|||CC|Okay; 153.|||LMP|Gordy, where did you say your ATS satellite picture left off to the west?|||CC|Okay. To the west, it goes clear on over to Africa. But to the south, it cuts off about 30 south, or not quite all of Australia.|||LMP|Okay. Yes, that mushroom pattern we've been talking about, on either edge - either end of the cap - and the mushroom points north - is a major cyclone circulation system. And also taking - moving, in one case - or trending, in one case, to the northwest and the other to the northeast, there are linear cloud patterns. Gives it a very symmetrical and a striking appearance. I hope it shows on those pictures.||02 16 30 43|CC|Okay. It doesn't show on the one I got. Maybe a later version will have that one. Because it cuts - It's cut off on this one.|||CDR|(Chuckle) Hey, Gordo. This is Geno.|||CC|Go ahead.|||CDR|To put this update in simple terms - at 65, I guess on our clocks, you'll update us to about 67:40, right?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||CDR|Does that mean we have to eat 2 hours and 40 minutes earlier?|||CC|Oh, you got me there. I - You haven't been eating -you haven't eaten since breakfast. Is that right?|||CDR|Oh, yes, sir. We just finished. We'll take another go at it, but I feel I've spending my life here eating.||||||Tape 45/2|||||CC|Yes. Well, we'll leave it up to you on this special case here.|||CDR|Okay, I think we'll take - a - a jab at supper here later in the day as per the Flight Plan.||02 16 34 02|CC|All right.|||CDR|Gordy - the whole suiting operation - I was really very pleased with. Jack and I both got in our suits very easily. And one by one we went into the LM. And that's where we zipped each other up. And we really had little or no trouble. We took our time. We got all configured in terms of changing our pockets around and whatever else we needed to do. And, actually, I think it's much easier to get suited than it is to get unsuited, personally.|||CC|Okay. Sounds good.|||CDR|Ron stayed suited and did the entire tunnel work. And then went - did it by himself - and then totally doffed his suit and stowed it by himself, also, to sort of extend that little exercise.||02 16 35 16|CC|Roger.||02 16 46 31|CC|America, Houston. Halftime score is 28 to 3 -Cowboys.|||CDR|Keep talking, Gordo.|||CC|Okay, I'll keep talking (laughter). The - I've learned that when you get to the ALFMED and pull it there, you'll see some tape around the emulsion shields. Those are three rectangular areas in front of your eyes and to either side that contain the photographic emulsion. This tape is around the edges of each of those three areas to help seal out light leaks. You haven't seen it before. Leave the tape on there. Don't pull it off. Over.|||CDR|Okay.||02 16 48 12|LMP|Gordy, just took a series of pictures of the Earth with the 35-millimeter using the polarizing filter||||||||Tape 45/3||||in the two positions. And the frame count is now 39- I took six pictures. And with the filter, on the first of each pair, in the DOWN position. The second's in the UP position. And I changed the f-stop from - the first set at f/4, the second set at f/2, and the third set at f/8.|||CC|Okay; we got all that, Jack.|||LMP|And, Gordy, you might ask one of the experts around there in - Is the lightmeter in the 35-millimeter integrating over the interior spot, or over the hairline spot? The larger one.|||CC|Okay, I'll ask.|||LMP|It acts as if it's the interior one, but||02 16 49 52|CC|Okay.|||CC|Jack. The answer to your question is the center spot is weighted for 60 percent of the reading and the rest of it for 40 percent. Over.|||LMP|Okay. That - that makes sense. That would explain why the needle moved as I moved it across the series of spots.||02 16 51 48|CC|Roger. Note: At 2 days 17 hours, the GET in the MCC was updated. To correlate times from this point on, add 2 hours 40 minutes to those shown in this transcript to make them correspond to MCC GET.||02 17 00 42|CDR|Gordo, we're - we're ready any time you are for that update. And after we get the T , and everything ephem squared away, we'll go into ALFMED.|||CC|Roger. Stand by on that, Geno; and we'll be with you in a minute.|||CDR|Hello, Robert. How are you today?|||CC|Real fine, Gene. You're sounding great.||||||Tape 45/4||||02 17 01 06|CDR|Doing great out here.||02 17 03 43|CC CMP|Geno, we're ready for the clock update. We'd like POO and ACCEPT. And we're got two loads to put in, so it will take a couple of minutes here. Okay, you got it?||02 17 03 58|CC|Thank you, Ron.||02 17 06 08|CC|17, Houston. I've got an update on your flyby maneuver pad due to this clock update. Would you like to copy it?|||CDR|Stand by just 1 second (music).|||LMP|Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the flyby pad.|||CC|Okay, stand by 1 on that - on our end. We're done with the - we're done with the up-load. The computer is yours, and we need a read-out on the Tephem|||LMP|Okay, that's in work.|||CC|Okay, we've got the read-out.||02 17 10 05|CC|17, Houston. The data looks good, and you're GO to copy it, and recommend you copy it into the Plight Plan Supplement. And that's on page 1-43 of the supplement.||02 17 10 27|LMP|Okay, Houston. We have it.||02 17 11 49|CC|And, 17, we got that flyby pad now. If you're still ready, we're ready.|||LMP|Okay. Is this a full pad or just a change to the other one?|||CC|It's just a change, Jack. It's a change to NOUN 83, the GETI, and a change to the bottom line, the GET of .05G. Just two changes.|||LMP|Okay, go ahead.||||||||Tape 45/5|||CC|Jack, if you'll just add 2 hours and 40 minutes to each one of them, that's it. The GETI is 081:54:43.49. The GET of .05G, 156:04:03- Jack, I guess I read 8l. I was looking at the old pad. It's 83 - 083 - on the GETI.|||LMP|You're too fast for me. I was just going to chew you out.|||CC|Sorry about that, Jack. I got it around the room.|||LMP|083 - (laughter) 083:54:43.49; 156:04:03.|||CC|Roger.||02 17 14 10|CDR|Okay, Bob. We got all of our clocks set on board.|||CC|Roger. Understand.|||CDR|What was the exact amount of that update time?|||CC|Two hours, 40 minutes; 2 plus 40.|||CDR|Okay, 2 plus 40, exactly. Thank you.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. We're going to work up an appetite with the ALFMED today.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Hey, Bob. May be a little premature - but I don't think so - but I think there was some good thinking into that update, looking at the Flight Plan up until now and where we go from here. I don't think we - we overlooked a thing.|||CC|Roger. Like I said the other night, we gave Tommy a gold star on that one.|||CDR|Except I think he and Rita got in - in cahoots.|||CC|A little soon for supper, huh?|||CDR|Yes. We just finished lunch, and it's about time to eat again.|||CC|That's known as the simulator step-ahead.||||||Tape 45/6|||||LMP|Can you give us our distance from the Moon - from the Earth?|||CC|Roger. Stand by on that.|||LMP|Are we about 5000 miles closer now?|||CC|Don't you wish.|||LMP|Well, isn't that what - isn't that the way these step-aheads work?||02 17 16 58|CC|Normally, yes. But this one didn't work that way. Jack, you're at 183,000 miles. It's really amazing how time flies when you're interested in your work, isn't it?||02 17 18 36|CC|Jack, Houston. Did you read your - my last call with the distance?||02 17 24 32|CDR|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead, 17.|||LMP|Okay, Bob, we're getting ready for the ALFMED. I just took a red-filter and a blue-filter pictures, - On frame 4l now, with a 35-millimeter - pictures of the Earth. And I took them one stop smaller -that is, more open - than the lightmeter said, hoping to compensate for the small Earth. The Earth just barely fills the most inner - the innermost circle of the spotmeter. Also, there's a very strong band of clouds, shaped sort of like a narrow fir tree, with a base about 20 degrees of longitude west of Baja California, that extends up, I believe, into the vicinity of Hawaii. And the top terminates in a very strong northern cyclone pattern.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Was your magazine Sierra Sierra?|||LMP|That's affirm. Sierra Sierra.|||CC|Roger, Jack. And you say that cloud is right -that cloud area is right near Baja California? I've got a picture of it here in front of me, from one of the satellites.||||||||Tape 45/7|||LMP|No, it's about 20 degrees west - longitude degrees west of that.|||CC|Yes. Okay, we've got it on the spot here.||02 17 26 13|LMP|And maybe even more than that. Okay, maybe even more than that. It1s - it might be as much as 40 degrees west, and - Actually Hawaii may be on the west side of that. It's a little hard to tell. It's close enough to the LM that it's hard to say.|||CC|Roger, Jack. I think I've got it on our map here. It shows a pretty heavy dense cloud area right . down in that area you're talking about.||02 17 27 26|CDR|Okay, Bob. For the ALFMED, CDR will be in the left seat. CMP will be in the center seat with the ALFMED. For our reporting, when we get the VOX, we'll just call out our first names to shorten it and the comments following. And Jack will be recording.||02 17 27 49|CC|Roger. We'll be listening.||02 17 31 00|CMP|Okay, wait a minute. Houston, how do you read on VOX with the lightweight headset?|||CC|Read you loud and clear, Ron.|||CMP|Okay.|||CMP|Yes. Wait a minute. Let me get this little old box set to go here, first.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|Yes.||02 17 32 09|CMP|Okay, UTILITY POWER is OFF.|||SC|Yes. POWER switch is OFF. Okay, it's connected, now.||02 17 32 33|CMP|Okay, UTILITY POWER is ON. Okay, let me get strapped in here, somehow, or I'll float all over.|||CMP|(Music) Okay, let's see.||||||Tape 45/8|||||CMP|Uh huh, I think I can.||02 17 35 02|CMP|Okay, my blindfold's going on, now.|||CMP|Okay. Sounds like they clipped. Okay, somebody will have to help me put this thing on now; yes , just kind of like so; yes. It goes around the old - -|||SC|Yes, but you ought to ... kind of maintain your head in the same position, if you can.|||CMP|... to operate now?||02 17 37 57|SC|No, Just turn it down a little bit.|||CMP|Go to operate while you're taking the pictures there (chuckle).|||CDR|Hello, Houston. CDR put his blindfold on at 68:18.|||CC|Okay, we copy that.||02 17 39 12|CDR|And how do you read me in VOX, Bob? This is Gene.|||CC|Read you loud and clear, Gene.|||CDR|Okay, I'm conducting the experiment. And the -frame Sierra Sierra is now at 45. I got two shots. One - two from the side and two from the bottom.|||CC|Roger. Copy.|||CMP|Hey, looks like a countdown for ready to go, Jack?|||CDR|Hey, Bob, does it make any difference if your eyes are opened or closed?|||CC|(Chuckle) It may be a personal thing, Gene. I -This is Stu. I had to have my eyes closed but give it either way.|||CDR|Okay; thank you.|||CMP|Okay, we'll count down to start. 3, 2, 1 -||02 17 40 28|CMP|MARK it. It's buzzing.||||||||Tape 45/9||02 17 40 52|CDR|Yes.|||SC|...||02 17 45 35|CDR|Change it. The other side is not very good.|||CMP|... two.||02 17 46 08|CDR|MARK. Gene. I've got a series of random lines, which do not appear to be the width of my field of view, that are moving like a flashing horizon with thunderstorms on the horizon. They're dimly flashing, and they're moving across the eye from left to right and from top to bottom, individually. Both eyes. It's stopped now.||02 17 47 03|CDR|MARK, this is Gene again. Going from the upper left to the bottom right. Lines of the same sort of thing. Dimly lit flashing horizon-type flashes. But they're linear. They're linear, and they tend to come from the - either the upper left or the upper right and work their way downward. Now they've stopped. Both eyes.||02 17 48 50|CDR|MARK. Gene again. Both eyes. This time the same flashes on the horizon, but they don't seem to be moving out of both eyes. Tend to be up at the tops of both eyes. Just rapid, sequential, lightninglike flashes. And they've stopped.||02 17 50 00|CDR|MARK. Gene again. Similar type of flashes. They don't seem to be moving, but they're coming from the right of the right eye and from the upper left of the right eye. And I can actually see an outline of a - of a curved horizon, and the flashes are coming out from behind it. They've stopped.||02 17 50 46|CDR|MARK. Gene again. I see - peripherally out of my right eye - I cannot see these flashes - but I can see peripherally the right-hand and upper-right-hand side of my right eye being lit up.|||CDR|Pardon?|||SC||||CDR|This last one? They were peripherally. I couldn't see them. All I know is that there was some light out - peripherally out - yes, but a flashing glow.||||||Tape 45/10||||02 17 52 08|CDR|Oh, man, there is a good one. The left eye, right in the middle, it's - almost a purple flash. It's still going. Right in the middle of my eye, and it's coming out from behind a - a horizon that is almost - It starts out as a semicircle and then folds into a point like on a pencil. And then it disappears. That's the horizon, and the light is flashing from behind It. It's gone.||02 17 53 31|CC|Hey, Gene, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay. According to all our experts here, the phenomena you're describing is pretty much the phosphene effect - sort of like when you rub your eyes or squint your eyes too hard - because the effect is lasting too long. The streaks or the flashing that we're looking for are very fast, and they do not remain as a scene to your eye. And I guess the only thing we could say would be to maybe either relax your squint a little bit or to ... the blindfold's on exceptionally tight. I know this sounds kind of screwy, but those are the words that we would like to - like to say to you. But the actual phenomena we're looking for will be a very short-lived phenomena. It will either be a flash or a very fast streak. Something along this - We're not trying to load the data, but we feel you're describing a different phenomena.||02 17 55 20|CDR|Stu, we lost all that last conversation. You better repeat it.|||CC|Okay, Gene. Sorry about that, and here I thought I had waxed so eloquently. But the - the effect you're describing is an effect that can come from rubbing your eyes or perhaps squinting too hard. But the effect we're looking for - and I guess we're really not trying to load the data - but the effect that we're looking for is a very short-lived phenomena and would not - -||02 17 55 50|CMP|MARK. Ron. I got one. In the right eye, Coming from - back - going towards ... Very narrow streak.||||||||Tape 45/11|||CC|And, Gene, our only words of wisdom are try to relax the - the eyes a little bit or if you have the blindfold on exceptionally tight, you might work on that. But the - just - I guess sort of relax and see if we can see the other - the other phenomena.||02 17 56 28|CDR|Okay.||02 17 59 26|CMP|MARK, Ron. One about 12:00 in the right eye; looked like it was just a spot.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 46/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||02 18 02 43|CMP|About 15 seconds ago. It's so dim I hardly noticed what it was, but kind of starting in the left eye and then - just a flash in the left eye and then a flash in the right eye; very dim. Going left -from left to right.||02 18 04 38|CMP|MARK. Can't tell if it's right or left eye. Looks like it's almost between the two eyes. There's a -||02 18 04 47|CMP|MARK. One in the left eye. Just about right in the center. Spot; no streak or anything, just a spot. First spot seemed to be right between the two eyes, upper half of the field of view.||02 18 08 43|CDR|MARK; Gene. Streak from the upper right, of the right eye, down to about the middle.||02 18 10 24|CMP|MARK; Ron. About 8 o'clock ... diameter out, just a bright flash; it's the brightest flash I've seen yet. Left eye.||02 18 10 45|CDR|"Just about a second or two after Ron said ""Mark,"" I saw a vertical bright line in the left side of the left eye; just flashed."||02 18 11 36|CMP|It was the greatest intensity - the intensity on that last one I had - but - the brightness was there, but it was kind of dull glow to it. It wasn't a - a spot that you could really focus on.||02 18 13 22|CMP|MARK; Ron. Left eye, about 09:30, half way - -||02 18 13 29|CDR|MARK - -|||CMP|- - to the left.|||CDR|- - Gene. Left eye, very bright spot; left eye, left side about halfway in towards the middle. That was the brightest one I've seen, and it was Just a spot.|||CMP|Ron. The intensity of the last one I had was -oh, a fourth of the bright one I had before that.||||||Tape 46/2|||||CMP|Spot. Yes, on the left eye.||02 18 15 08|CMP|MARK about 5 seconds ago, about 6 o'clock in the right eye.||02 18 15 15|CMP|MARK. Right between the two eyes, seemed like. Both spots.||02 18 15 27|CDR|MARK; Gene. A sharp line from the center of the left eye to the upper left-hand - upper left-hand side.||02 18 16 4l|CDR|MARK; Gene. It's a very short - very short line, upper left hand of left eye going towards the right.||02 18 17 32|CDR|MARK; Gene. Upper right eye, tangential to my eye, just a very short line. Moving - -||02 18 17 44|CMP|MARK; Ron. Oh, a fourth of a diameter out in the right eye. Bright spot. Seemed like it was coming in. I could see the spot and then the streak. It went from that point kind of in - or up, I guess.||02 18 19 53|CDR|MARK; Gene. A dull flash on the bottom inside corner of the right eye. Correction - -||02 18 20 02|CMP|MARK; Ron. Go ahead, Gene.|||CDR|Okay. Correction, Gene. That was on the left eye, that last one.||02 18 20 11|CMP|The last one for Ron was at 10 o'clock. Three-fourths of the diameter out. Just a - ... was only about an eighth of an inch in diameter. Right eye.||02 18 23 04|CDR|MARK; Gene.||02 18 23 06|CDR|MARK again. A flash - first flash was in the left eye on the left side. It went vertal - vertically up and away. And following that was a flash in the identically same spot. It was a line flash, up and away. On the left side of each eye, and it went up in both cases, but they were split by about 2 seconds.||||||||Tape 46/3||02 18 28 40|CMP|MARK; Ron. A fourth of the diameter out at 3 o'clock in the right eye. I mean a half a diameter - half a radius; put it that way.||02 18 28 51|CDR|MARK; Gene. A flash across the bottom of the right eye coming inward from left to right.|||CMP|On the last one, it looked like it was a - -||02 18 29 15|CDR|MARK; Gene. Just a spot flash in the bottom of the left eye.|||CMP|This is Ron. On my last one, it was just a spot flash. No direction to it at all.||02 18 29 57|CMP|Ron; MARK, MARK; this is Ron. When I first said the word - it kind of looks like a - almost a sine wave transition from the corner upper at 10 o'clock in the right eye to about 2 o'clock in the left eye. Right between the two of them. The sin wave was - maybe two wiggles in it, and it was about a fourth of an inch long. Going from right to left, yes. And going into the left at about 2 o'clock.|||CDR|Turn that music higher.|||CMP|Yes.||02 18 31 20|CMP|MARK; Ron. Seems like I looked up, and as I looked  up, there was one in the left eye about 12 o'clock just a flash. On the outer periphery.||02 18 38 01|CMP|MARK; Ron. ... down about 06:30; just a flash. Right eye.||02 18 38 42|CMP|MARK; Ron. Left eye, about 03:30, three-quarters of the radius out. A very dim flash. About 03:30.||02 l8 39 44|CMP|MARK; Ron. Left eye. Starting at 5 o'clock on the circumference going to 3 o'clock at about three-quarter diameter - three-quarter radius, I mean. Just a straight line.|||CMP|Did I say left eye? I guess I meant did. Okay, let's - Okay, the motor quit.||||||Tape 46/4||||02 18 4l 11|CDR|Okay. Is that it? Yes, I can get that, Gene.|||CMP|Okay, you want to take a picture of it first? Okay, POWER ... Okay, stand by. 3,2,1-||02 18 4l 59|CMP|MARK it. POWER switch OFF.|||CDR|Say, Bob or Stu.|||CC|Roger. Go ahead.||02 18 42 34|CDR|Okay, add - to ad to today. Not last night, but -I guess the first night I was in bed - I definitely saw some of these - because I had a hard time going to bed, to start with - I saw some of the same peripheral horizon-type things you said were not the type of data you were looking for; but I also saw a - some sets of the streaks. And probably the one most imposing thing I remember is - and the last one I remember before falling asleep - was the fact that there was a very bright spot that flashed right between my eyes like a very bright headlight - like a train coming at you, only with a flash. It's difficult probably to estimate the frequency of any of those because I was in a -sort of a sleep-hazy mode.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|But then, as today, I saw some that flashed and lit up the horizon and some that lit up peripherally; and I guess, as you say, that's a different kind of data, but I did see them there and they impressed me.|||CC|Okay. We got all that, Gene.|||CDR|Okay.|||CMP|And it might be interesting to know I've never seen it before today,|||CC|Hey, Gene, we appreciate all the data. We were just trying to make the data fit the curve; you know the old trick.||||||||Tape 46/5||02 i8 44 40|CDR|Okay, I just wanted you to - just told them like we saw them. That's all.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|I will say one thing, though; no question in my mind but that they're there. Last trip I took, I guess I just wasn't looking for them or paying any attention to them. Maybe they were there and I ignored them because of other things. But they're there.|||LMP|Okay, all you flash bugs down there - or flashbulbs I guess is the word - frame 50. I just took four pictures to show - two on the side and two on the bottom - to show the position of the ALFMED, and one of them of each set was focused on the ALFMED. The others were focused on the - the other set was focused on the struts.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|And when you don't have anything else to do, why don't you have somebody predict where the S-IVB is. I think I've got her spotted - behind us and above us with respect to the Earth and our travel from it.|||CC|FIDO just went out and shot himself, but we'll get working on it.|||LMP|Oh, don't worry about it. Shoot. I thought you guys might have an idea off-the-cuff there.|||CC|No, what's humorous on this, Jack, is they have really been working on that S-IVB impact point -, and they've really been - it's been a - a real difficult problem for them so far.|||LMP|I'll tell you, I bet you Ron could give a star sighting on it (laughter). I looked at it through the monocular and sure looks like the S-IVB.|||CC|Jack, we're not doubting you at all. We could probably start cranking it right now.||||||Tape 46/6||||02 18 46 46|CC|Jack, are you sto - you all stowing the ALFMED now or are you done?|||CMP|What's that, Bob?|||CC|Are you all done with the ALFMED now, Ron?|||CMP|Yes, I've got to get it to - get the plate moved back down there yet.|||CC|Okay, Ron - -|||CMP|... get the blindfold off first so I can see what I'm doing.|||CC|Roger. I just want you to know. We've got a real long update coming up to you here on the LOI abort charts and that - and it's going to be, probably, a difficult readup. And you're the most familiar with the charts; you probably would want to take them. But whenever you want to take them, they are on - charts on page 3-8l, 3-82, and then the cue card for LOI limits. Whenever you want to take them. It will be a lengthy one.|||CMP|Stand by, Bob. Let us get squared away from the ALFMED; then we can get going on that.|||CC|No, I don't want to hurry you, Ron. I just want you to know what - when - just get yourself comfortable and be ready to take them whenever you want them. It's going to be a lengthy time, though.||02 18 47 51|CMP|Okay.|||CDR|Hey, Bob, I'm looking at what - what Jack was talking about; and it's definitely not a particle that's nearby because there is another one I can look at and get a three-dimensional comparison with. It is a - it is a bright object, and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing. It's way out in the distance, as I say, because there are particles that are close by and it's obviously not one of those. It's apparently rotating in a||||||||Tape 46/7||||very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost - almost on time. And it's as we look back at the Earth, it's up at about 11:00 about - oh, maybe 10 or 12 Earth diameters. I don't know whether that does you any good, but there is something out there.|||CC|Roger. We don't doubt it, Gene. And we might work out a set of gimbal angles or something here; maybe we can get a look at it through the optics.||02 18 49 02|CDR|Okay. And I - I - I just want to emphasize that it's definitely not - not one of these particles that tends to look like a star out there. It's something physical in the distance. (Laughter) Oh, yes.|||SC|... thing off.||02 18 50 13|CMP|Yes, guess I am.|||CC|Okay, Gene. If you can call up a NOUN 20 so we know the spacecraft attitude, and if you can reference the object you're looking at out of your window, with - with respect to body axis and let us look at your - your - give us a mark, somehow, and give us your NOUN 20s, we can try and get a tie-in and start locating - locating this object down for you.||02 18 50 58|CDR|Okay, I'm looking it out - looking at it out the center window - the hatch window - and I'll give you a hack when it crosses the XX axis at the center window; and I guess it's up maybe 45 degrees|||CC|Okay, give us a hack and we're copying your NOUN 20s right now.|||CDR|Okay, Jack says pitched up about 30 degrees but - -|||LMP|No. 451 because -|||CDR|Yes, he agrees. It's 45 degrees pitched up, and I'll give you a hack when it crosses the XX axis.|||CDR|Okay -||||||Tape 46/8||||02 18 51 32|CDR|MARK it. It just crossed through the - -|||CC|Mark. We got it.|||CDR|- - let's call it the XZ plane of the spacecraft. One unique thing about it, Bob, is that it's got two flashes. As it comes around in - in rhythmic fashion, you get a very bright flash; and then you get a dull flash. And then it'll come around with a bright flash, and then a dull flash.||02 18 52 18|LMP|That's the side and - of the S-IVB - and then the engine bell, Gene.|||LMP|The commander doesn't think that I can see the engine bell on that thing.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Is that with the monocular you're looking at it?|||CDR|He couldn't see the engine bell if he had 10 monoculars.|||CMP|Okay. I've got the cable restowed now.|||CC|Say again, Ron.||02 18 53 10|CMP|And, Gene, where's your blindfold?||02 18 55 24|LMP|Bob, couple of revolutions ago when I was looking at it, I had a much brighter view and I believe I was looking at it broadside. It looks to me like it may be flashing more or less end-on now. It's much, not - not as bright, although it's getting brighter. But it's not as bright now as it was awhile ago.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|... we've been noticing that, I think, for about 24 hours or so. I just - hadn't put it together as maybe being the S-IVB. I thought it was just some other particle out there.||02 18 56 27|CC|Roger, Jack.|||CDR|Hey, Robert, what's the final Cowboy score?||||||||Tape 46/9|||CC|Okay; I was just going to update that. The Cowboys won it 34 to 24. And by winning it, they wrap up the wild-card slot in the NFC; and so both Washington and Dallas will be in the playoffs.||02 18 56 53|CDR|Sounds good.|||LMP|Bob, that line of clouds I called a fir-tree pattern that swings up towards Hawaii - Hawaii, if you will - has - also has a mushroom pattern on the top. It has the appearance as if two major air masses - one going from west to east and the other form east to west - have converged along that line, and the joint movement of air at the interface being south to north. And up in the area of Hawaii, I think, it tends to mushroom so that the pattern then goes back to flow from west to east on the east side and from east to west on the west side.|||CC|Roger.||02 18 58 27|LMP|In a little while, we'll probably get a pretty good look at a - what looks like a very concentrated intense storm that, I think, is just - east|||CMP|*** And then we'll put them, once we get updated a little bit. Yes, I'll get out of VOX in a minute.|||LMP|I was looking for the Flight Plan and stuff. And the little books.|||LMP|Say, Bob.|||CC|Go ahead.|||LMP|Houston, 17. How do you read?|||CC|Go ahead, Jack. Read you loud and clear.|||CDR|Okay, Bob, you want to update the LOI card and Flight Plan 3-82 and 3-81; is that right?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||CDR|Which one do you want to start on?||||||Tape 46/10|||||CC|I would say 3-81 is the most difficult one to start on.|||CDR|Okay, in that case, why don't you start on the board - on the cue card?|||CC|Okay. We can start on the cue card. Your - your druthers.|||CDR|Yes, go ahead. I'm ready.|||CC|"Okay, on the LOI limits. The VGO column - let's go right down the VGO column; I think that would be the easiest way to do it. Where it says, ""VGO 2980,"" change that to ""2986."""|||CDR|Why don't you just keep going?|||CC|"Okay. The next one going straight down the line, ""2721, 2521, and 2316."" That's, all the changes on the VGO line."|||CDR|Okay; and all those changes were in Mode I?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||CDR|Okay, I got 2986, 2721, 2521, 2316.|||CC|Roger. Now under the burn time column, the first one opposite the 2986, the burn time remains the same. Do not change that one. The next one changes -|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|Zero plus 40.|||CDR|Which one is that, Bob? I missed you.|||CC|"Okay. Where it says, ""0 plus 28,"" change that to ""0 plus 40."""|||CDR|Okay, press on through them all now.|||CC|"Change the ""0 plus 53"" one to ""l plus 10."" Change the ""l plus 31"" to the number ""l plus 40"". Over."||||||||Tape 46/11|||CDR|Okay. I got - in order - burn time 0, and then 0 plus 40, 1 plus 10, and 1 plus 40.|||CC|"Roger. V-measured column: the first one, the zero does not change. The next one - in this order: ""2651 465, and 670."" Over."|||CDR|Okay. I got 0, 265, 465 and 670.|||CC|That's affirmative, Gene. That's the changes to the LOI limits cue card.|||CDR|Okay, Bob, I think we got all that. I guess DELTA-V measured down there in the bottom - 2980 -should be 2986, huh?|||CC|Roger. We felt that wasn't - that  that is -correct. To be technically correct, it should be 2986 at that last one.|||CDR|Okay, I guess we're coming in just a sukosh hotter, huh?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||CC|You'll see from the curves that we're going to have to update, that you're a lot closer to the free-return trajectory.||02 19 06 17|CDR|Okay, why don't you go ahead on 3-81?|||CC|Okay, this is the tough one. The first thing we're going to do is plot a couple or three points here in the Mode I - 2-hour - the Mode I 2-hour line changes, also. So you might want to draw a line at a LOI DELTA-V DVM of 265, 265 and draw that straight up the curve. That'll be the no - the new--|||CDR|Okay, the LOI DELTA-V magnitude of - DVM of 265 huh?||02 19 07 01|CC|Roger. That will be the crossover point from the Mode I 2-hour to the Mode I 30-minute.||||||Tape 46/12|||||CDR|Bob, are you there?|||CC|That's affirmative. Go ahead.|||CDR|Okay, Bob, I've got a - 265 vertical line drawn and I expect I can extend the Mode I 2-hour abort to that limit.|||CC|That is affirmative, Gene.|||CC|Now you're going to have a new curve, so don't bother to draw in the old curve. We're going to give you three points to plot and draw a straight line in between them that will create a new curve.|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay. The first one is at - the point is defined with a DELTA-VM of zero and an abort DELTA-V of 1525, 1525.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|Okay, the second point is defined by a DELTA-VM of 150; an abort DELTA-V of 1810. Over.|||CDR|Bob, that last was 1810?|||CC|That's affirmative.||02 19 10 37|CDR|Okay. I got it.|||CC|Okay, and the last point is defined by DELTA-VM of 265; an abort DELTA-V of 2105.|||CC|The curve - -|||CDR||||CC|- - defined by those three points will be your LO - LOI plus 2-hour abort DELTA-V.|||CDR|Okay, and that - that last point is just the DPS available curve with 265.|||CC|That's affirmative.||||||||Tape 46/13|||CDR|Okay, it's drawn in and I - -|||CC|Okay, now we got a curve 1.|||CDR|- - guess at 2. Okay, go ahead.|||CC|I'm sorry I cut you out. Did you have something else you want on that?|||CDR|No, it's good. Our curve's in.|||CC|Okay. Curve 1 is two points defining it. The first one is DELTA-VM of 265, abort DELTA-V of 1855-|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|And the second one is a DELTA - DELTA-VM of 400, abort DELTA-V of 2065.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|Okay. Those two points from the curve 1 of the Mode I 30-minute.|||CDR|Okay, I got it.|||CC|Okay, now curve 2 has three points defining it. The first point is identical with the end point of curve 1. It's 400 on the DELTA-VM and 2065 on the abort DELTA-V.|||CDR|All right.|||CC|Okay, the second point is 530 for the DVM and 2245 for the abort DELTA-V.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|And the last point is DVM of 670 and a DELTA-V -abort DELTA-V of 2475.|||CDR|Okay.||||||Tape 46/l4||||02 19 l4 49|CC|Okay; and if you draw a line up the page at the DVM of 670, that is the end of the Mode I 30-minute and everything to the right of that you are in Mode II.|||CC|Gene, Houston.|||CDR|Stand by, Bob.||02 19 l6 05|CC|Roger.||02 19 20 14|CDR|Hello, Houston. Are you reading yet?|||CC|Roger. Go ahead.|||CDR|Okay, Bob, curve looks good. I just checked the DPS/APS crossover on the DPS available, and it comes out with what you gave me on the card -about 2521.|||CC|Roger. And just one minor point. Across the top, on the velocity to be gained, you can bias all those numbers - add a six to every one of them across the top, to be technically correct.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|The next thing we have on that, Gene - -|||CDR|... correct, I could have done that before I -before I plotted the curve; but that's good. We understand, and we got it down.|||CC|Okay. The next thing I've got is - that whole update column in the little block there is all updated; and we probably ought to get a readback on all these numbers, Gene. I can give it to you right like a regular pad, just from the - right down from the top to the bottom, and then read it back to me. I think that'll be the best way, don't you?|||CDR|Okay. Ron's going to go ahead and take them; and we'll double check them, and he'll read them back.|||CC|Okay.||||||||Tape 46/15|||CMP|Okay, just go ahead and start at the top and go down.|||CC|Okay. I'm starting at LOI ignition time. 88:54:26.8. Pitch is minus 43, yaw 112. GET abort ignition, 89:24:26.8; roll 217, pitch 6, yaw 25. Minus 42 on the Pitch, 110 on the yaw. 216, 6, 18. High-gain angles again. Minus 75, Yaw 250; GET abort ignition there 90:5^:26.8; 153, 17, 19* Next time there is GET abort ignition for the LM FDAI angles there - 90:54:26.8; Roll, Pitch, and Yaw angles, 202, 29, 330. Over.|||CMP|Okay, Bob, here we go on the readback. I'll Just read them right down the line. 88:5^:26.8; minus 43, 112, 89:24:26.8; 217, 6, 25; minus 42, 110; 216, 6, 18; minus 75, 250; 90:54:26.8; 153, 17, 19, 90:54:26.8; 202, 29, 330. Over.|||CC|Roger, Ron. A real good readback. The - on the next page, on page 3-82, the data there is exactly the same as the LOI limit cue card - the changes. We can read it up to you individually or you can take it from your cue cards; your choice.||02 19 25 00|CMP|No, we'll change it from the cue card.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Bob, since they won't let me write anything, I tried looking for the Moon near the Sun with the filters and could not see it.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|You sure you're sending us to the right place?|||CC|Roger, Jack. Hey, I've got some information on that S-IVB that you're looking at. The azimuth was in - within 1 degree of what you called when we looked - checked out on your angles.|||CC|Hey, Jack. Houston.|||CC|17, Houston.||||||Tape 46/16|||||CMP|Go ahead, Bob.||02 19 27 54|CC|This was for Jack and Gene. The trench has computed the S-IVB location in reference to your body axis; and the azimuth was within 1 degree, very close, and the - we calculate it should have been out of that window at 62 degrees from the X-axis, and you reported 45 degrees, which is just a 17-degree error. It's real close there. You know, just eyebailing it like that.|||LMP|That's great. Then that is the S-IVB, huh?|||CC|Okay. Well, we - you might check it this way, Jack. Line up the star Denebola and Rigel - say again, Regulus; I'm sorry, Regulus - Denebola and Regulus. And then, on that line, go perpendicular to that line right above Ri - rigiht above Regulus, and that should be the S-IVB. It forms one point of a right triangle with Denebola and Regulus.|||LMP|What you're saying is, it's the eye of Leo the Lion.|||CC|That1 s firm.|||LMP|Except we can't see Leo the Lion very well.||02 19 29 11|CC|Okay.|||CC|And, 17; Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|We've got a rather lengthy Flight Plan update series here. We can read up to you any time you want. Just a reminder that we are sitting here waiting with it. Your call.|||LMP|Generally what is it, Bob?|||CC|It's changing a number of attitudes all through the Flight Plan, 84:32 - 84:35; changing VERB 49 maneuver, things like that, due to the TLC change here on times and that.||||||||Tape 46/17|||LMP|Okay, where are you going to start?|||CC|Okay, it's at 84:32. Standby 1. Jack, FLIGHT||02 19 31 24|CDR|Just told me we can wait on this if you want until some other time in the Flight Plan. We want to get into this Experiment Checklist with the pa -pan camera, mapping camera film cycling. Or we can do both of them concurrently. Hey, Bob, let's get the camera cycling out of the|||CC|way first, and then we'll pick up the Flight Plan updates. Roger. We concur with that.|||LMP|Okay, Bob, I'll get to that camera in just a|||CC|second. The coast of Australia is starting to come into view. Still looks pretty clear. We'll give you more on that later, probably. That cyclone I talked about yesterday in the vicinity, I believe, of the Solomon Islands, looks even better organized than yesterday. It's really tightening up. Starting to look very bright and dense right in the core, not too dissimilar from Therese. Although it has a little broader extent in the southeast quadrant. Roger, Jack.|||CC|Trying to match that up in my prog here. I can't find it.|||LMP|Well, you didn't have it there yesterday either. It certainly looks like a tight little storm now though.|||CC|Roger. I understand.|||CC|Jack, would you mind repeating that location of that.|||LMP|Can't give you much on the progress - -||||||Tape 46/18|||||LMP|Well, I'll try to give it to you a little better later. It's the one I was talking about yesterday as being in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands. That's somewhat east-southeast of New Guinea.|||CC|Yes. Roger. I've got it.|||LMP|I think before we go to bed, we'll probably be able to update the progress of the - that front south of Australia, also.|||CC|Oh. Roger. I've - I've got a pretty disorganized area to the east of New Guinea. It's probably right over the Solomons. Looks pretty disorganized on our satellite photo - from, let's see, I guess that was this morning sometime.|||LMP|Well, there is a lot of cloudiness in the equatorial regions, the intertropical convergence zone in there. This is south of that, sort of on a - I'll talk to you later.||02 19 35 26|CC|Roger.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 47/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||02 19 38 27|LMP|Houston, how do you read 17?|||CC|Loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|Okay, S-BAND AUX TV to SCIENCE.||02 19 38 40|LMP|MARK it.|||LMP|Okay, SM/AC POWER is coming ON.||02 19 38 59|LMP|MARK it.|||LMP|MAPPING CAMERA to STANDBY.||02 19 39 13|LMP|MARK.||02 19 39 39|LMP|PAN CAMERA POWER is POWER; barber pole - gray.||02 19 39 50|LMP|SELF TEST is to HEATERS.||02 19 39 58|LMP|And, do you want the high gain?|||CC|That's affirmative.

And we'd like to select your checklist angles now on the high gain, please.|||LMP|Okay.|||LMP|Do you want those on the dial? You don't want me to try to acquire there, do you?|||CC|That's affi rmative.||02 19 44 38|LMP|Okay, SM/AC POWER is going to come OFF here, now.|||CC|Roger.||02 19 44 50|CMP|Okay, SM/AC POWER is OFF; and how is my ZPN doing?|||CC|Jack, say again your question, please.|||CMP|This is Ron. How is my ZPN doing?|||CC|Oh. Roger. Let me take a look here.|||CC|Hey, Ron, we don't - we don't want to say it's bad, but we're glad you're talking to us because we want to make sure you're with us.|||CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Let me ... a little bit then.|||CC|Roger. We think we've got a bad skin - skin sensor interface there, Ron.||||||||Tape 47/3||02 19 49 36|LMP|Bob, how do you read 17?|||CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|Okay; that storm I'm talking about - a little more precisely is maybe centered at 2 degrees latitude, north of the Solomon Islands.|||CC|Yes, that kind of matches up, Jack. Does it look like New Guinea and that is pretty well clobbered?|||LMP|No, not really. New Guinea is at the western edge of a cloud zone that is part of that inter-tropical convergence zone that starts at New Guinea and swings east-northeast in an arc for about half the visible Pacific, and then that arc crosses back down over the equator and heads generally towards Central America, I suspect, although that's beyond the terminator now. The storm I'm talking about is clearly south and separate from that inter-tropical convergence cloud - pattern.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|It's getting very tightly wound in the - the clockwise sense, and - and is - is just where there was a less well-organized pattern yesterday. Although maybe it's moved northward a little bit.|||CC|Roger. We understand, Jack.|||LMP|Our zero-phase point, Bob, is about 10 degrees -make that 15 degrees longitude east of the Solomons and has a - is a - fairly - low intensity at this time. I'll keep an eye on it as it approaches that storm area and see if it changes.|||LMP|Okay - I'll be ready for them. Bob, just one last thing on that line of clouds that stretches up toward Hawaii. They're very - they look very thick and dense based on the structure you can see as that - as the terminator approaches them. They cast a pretty strong shadow to the west.|||CC|Roger. I see those on our satellite photo. They look pretty - pretty thick in there. I'm strictly an amateur talking to you, Jack, but it looks pretty thick in there.||||||Tape 47/4|||||LMP|Yes, right.|||LMP|How about some flight - when you come around again, can you start the Plight Plan updates?|||CC|Any time you want them, I can start them.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay, the first one is at 84:32 in the Flight Plan.|||LMP|84:22. Go ahead.|||CC|84:32. 32. Add the following.|||LMP|Okay.|||CC|"""Roll right 12 degreesin parentheses, ""To a roll of 150."" The purpose of this change is to avoid - -"|||LMP|Say again the - say again the number in parentheses.|||CC|R, roll of 150, 150.|||LMP|"Okay, at 84:32, ""Roll right 12 degrees to roll 150."""|||CC|Roger. And in parentheses here, just a comment, it's to avoid gimbal lock during VERB 49 maneuver directly below it.|||LMP|Okay; go ahead.|||CC|"Okay. At 84:35, the VERB 49 maneuver, change the attitude to ""Roll 320, pitch 010, yaw 324."" And we want the high gain antenna angles: PITCH, minus 29; YAW 17. Over."|||LMP|Okay. 320, 010, 324. High gain: PITCH, minus 29; YAW, 17* And that's at - that's for the VERB 49 maneuver at 84:35-|||CC|"That's affirm. And it goes without saying, scratch ou - scratch out ""OMNI Alfa"" there."|||LMP|Got you.||||||||Tape 47/5|||CC|Okay, the next one is at 85:42. 85:42.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|This is just a couple of notes here. The P52 stars we got in the CMS are 16 and 17. Gyro torquing will take 10 minutes 47 seconds, 10 minutes 47 seconds.|||LMP|Okay, the stars will be stars 16 and 17 Torquing will take 10 minutes 40 seconds - 47 seconds.|||CC|"That's affirmative, Jack. Okay, at 85:44, over there on the right where it says, ""LOI REFSMMAT attitude,"" change that - ""roll 064, pitch 135, yaw 005."" Over."|||LMP|Okay, got you. Change is to roll 064, pitch 135, yaw 005.||02 19 58 23|CC|Okay, Jack, and let's take a break here, and you can go ahead and secure the high gain and give me OMNI Bravo, and call me when you're ready for some more of these.||02 19 59 05|LMP|Okay, go ahead.|||CC|"Okay, Jack. The next one is an addition at 86 hours, 86 hours. We just want the following words: ""Manually pressurize SPS."" Over."|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay; did you get that last one, 86 hours?|||LMP|"Roger. 86 hours, ""Manually pressurize the SPS."""|||CC|That's affirmative. And just for your information, that's because we need a couple hours of data on it. Like to look at it a couple of hours prior to LOI. Okay, the next one's at 87:20.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|"Okay. Where it says, ""Manual roll left to 30 degrees,"" change ""30 degrees"" to ""63 degrees,11 63 degrees. Change the roll angle - -"||||||Tape 47/6|||||LMP|All right.|||CC|"-- from ""050"" to ""001."""|||LMP|Okay, that's roll left 63 degrees and the roll is 001.|||CC|That's affirmative. And the new high gain angles will be PITCH, minus 27; YAW, 339.|||LMP|Okay, minus 27 and 339*|||CC|"Okay, just a little bit below that - where -at about 87:27 or 87:30, where it says, ""Manually roll right 30 degrees,"" change the ""30"" to ""63,"" 63. Change the roll to ""064."""|||LMP|Okay, roll right 63 degrees. Roll will be 064.|||CC|"That's affirmative. And scratch out ""OMNI Alfa"" and add ""High gain antenna: PITCH, minus 29; YAW, 17,"" YAW 17."|||LMP|Okay. That's high gain: PITCH, minus 29; YAW, 17.|||CC|Roger, Jack. And the next one is over at 89:03. We've got a comm attitude.|||LMP|Okay, 89:03.|||CC|Okay, that attitude there should - it's pretty close. Roll 165, pitch 060, yaw 338.||02 20 04 08|LMP|Go ahead, Bob.|||CC|Did you get that last - the attitude change there? It's a real trivia change; we probably shouldn't have called it, but it's - -|||LMP|89:03 ... to me.|||CC|- - 165, 060, and 338.|||LMP|89:03; excuse me.|||CC|Roger. Did you get that attitude at 89:03?||||||||Tape 47/7|||LMP|Repeat 89:03.|||CC|Roger. Roll 165 j pitch 060, yaw 338.|||LMP|Okay. New comm attitude: 165, 060, 338.|||CC|Roger. That seems hardly worth it on that, Jack. Sorry on that one. Just one last note, general note on all this we gave you. Everything has been checked in the CMS. You probably figured that anyway.|||CMP|Roger. Always know those fellows are working with us.|||CC|Roger. And, Ron, we've got good data on you now.|||LMP|Is that it?|||CC|That's affirmative, Jack.|||CMP|Okay; thank you, Jack||02 20 05 43|LMP|Bob, Gene just told me I may have confused you on the clouds that I told you I could see near the terminator with a good shadow - and the shadow's on the eastern side as the - the terminator approaches.|||CC|Roger.||02 20 09 40|LMP|Bob, hou do you read 17?|||CC|Read you loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|Okay, I mentioned earlier, I can't remember exactly when, that it looked like the wa - pattern of water in the Ross Sea - clear areas within the Ross Sea icepacks had changed, and I feel more strongly about that now. It looks like it's opened up considerably. The tri - long - elongate triangular areas, two of them that were there a couple of days ago, seem to have merged, and you also have clear water along most of the inner portion of the shoreline of that sea.|||CC|Roger. Must be getting towards summertime down there.||||||Tape 47/8|||||LMP|Well, I'm very surprised that it's changed shape as much as that, and it could be that that triangular pattern was caused by a cloud bank that split what is now open water and made it look as if it was icepack.|||CC|Roger. Understand.||02 20 11 10|LMP|Hey, Bob, can one of the guys there give me a -a hack on when - when the terminator should cross Hawaii?|||CC|Roger. We'11 work it out.|||LMP|Do it in either GET or CST, either one.|||CC|We'll crank it up to you in GET.||02 20 13 43|CC|Ron, we missed a NOUN 05 in there. Can you give us a NOUN 05?|||CC|Ron, Houston. We missed the NOUN 05 on the data -can you give us what your NOUN 05 was?|||CMP|Would you believe five balls?|||CC|Oh, I'd believe that.|||CMP|Okay.|||CC|You can go ahead and torque, Ron.|||CMP|Roger. Roger. We'll torque at 30 - 5^ 30.||02 20 16 17|CC|Jack, Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Roger. We've been listening to the playback of the DSE tape from the ALFMED period, and all three of you sound pretty good on that. Gene is still clearer them the rest, but all three of you sound real clear and very readable.|||LMP|Excellent. That'll make up for my note taking.||||||||Tape 47/9|||CC|Roger. And also, Jack. You had a question earlier about the different response of sea and continental areas when viewed through monocular polarizing filter, and I've got a note here from John Dietrich that kind of explains it.|||LMP|Okay, let's hear what John has to say.|||CC|"Okay. This is pretty much referencing the time you were looking at it, and here it is. ""Ocean scenes near the bright area off Bolivia, which is the spel - specular point, include a high proportion of polarized light. The spacecraft-Earth-Sun geometry now is approximately equal to the Brewster angle which is nearest 53 degrees, where maximum plane polarization due to reflection occurs. Therefore, a high response of scene brightness to changes of filter position can be expected. Continental scenes are dominated by Lambertian or diffuse reflectors, which are characterized by low proportion of polarization in the reflected beam. For such scenes, changing position of the polarization filter produces changes in scene brightness that are near or below the threshhold of detectability."" Over."|||LMP|Okay. That sounds very good. It's sort of like the contrast between the lunar surface response and - the oceans being more like that, I guess, and the - between the lunar surface and terrestrial land surfaces.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|That's very good, very interesting. Thank - thank John for me. I should have thought about that, but I've been away from it too long.|||CC|No problem. Okay; terminator over Hawaii at 73:45 GET.||02 20 19 09|LMP|73:45; thank you.||02 20 25 47|LMP|Houston, 17. How do you read?|||CC|Go ahead. Read you loud and clear, Jack.||||||Tape 47/10|||||LMP|Roger. Gene and I are going to stir your cryos -Gene and I are going to stir your cryos for you.|||CC|Okay, we'll be watching for it.||02 20 29 21|CMP|Okay, Houston; Apollo 17 here. We have canister number 8 in the Bravo.|||CC|Roger; 8 in the Bravo. We got it. You made EECOM happy tonight there, Ron.|||CMP|Okay, and I'm still looking for my scissors.|||CC|For your what?|||CMP|My scissors.|||CC|What did you do, misplace them? Or do you want me to look up and see where they're supposed to be?|||CMP|(Laughter) No. They were stuck in the hand controller number 1. That little thing you're supposed to put the lap belt and things into. It was stuck in there last night when I went to bed, and I got up this morning, it was gone.|||CC|Scissor, scissor, who got the scissor, huh?|||LMP|... waiting for him to get up.|||CMP|Yes.|||CC CDR|Well, I've got a - I've got a feeling they're still with you somewhere. All sorts of things happened on his watch.|||CMP|Yes; we won't talk too much about that.||02 20 35 31|CMP|Houston, are you watching Jack's EKG?|||CC|Say again, Ron; we missed that.|||CMP|Roger. Are you watching Jack's and my EKG?|||CC|Roger. Let me punch the Surgeon here.||||||||Tape 47/11|||CMP|We're doing a little - we're doing a little bit of exercising, now.|||CC|Oh, we can see that in the cryos. We know you're doing exercises. Let me go over and get the numbers here.|||CC|Jack's at 120 on the heart rate.|||CMP|Okay.|||CC|And, Ron, you're about 90.|||CMP|Okay.|||CC|And, Jack - guess you can pass the word to Jack we refined that Hawaii terminator number through the Pacific fleet and called it all around. It is actually at 72:55 GET.|||CMP|Okay. 72:65 GET.|||CC|No, 72:55, 55.||02 20 36 45|CMP|Roger. 72:55 -||02 20 37 56|CC|Okay, Jack. We got you at 130 right now.||02 20 40 51|LMP|Houston, this is the LMP. What was the last number you saw on my heart rate?|||CC|Okay, you peaked at 135, and we had you at 130 for several minutes.|||LMP|Okay.||02 20 42 07|CC|Jack, just for interest, in that time you got banging around so hard there, you caused the heaters in the H2 to shut off. The - the pressure went up until the heater shut off.|||LMP|Well, that's what you wanted, wasn't it?|||CC|That's affirm.|||LMP|Good thing there's not another mission or we'd have to flight plan this kind of thing for your EECOMs.||||||Tape 47/12|||||CC|That's right. Got to conserve at all cost.|||LMP|Who's sitting on your right tonight?|||CC|Got a big Moon over there.|||LMP|He's always there, isn't he?|||CC|Roger.||02 20 44 33|LMP|Say, Bob, I took another picture of the Earth and forgot to give you the GET on it. That was about 15 minutes before the end of the ALFMED experiment, if you can go back that way.|||CC|Okay.|||CC|Let me see, Jack. We - the last thing we had was right about the end of it. We had you in Sierra Sierra, frame 50. And you had four pictures then. Is that before that or after that? Okay, those four were for the ALFMED, weren't they?|||LMP|That's affirm. No, this was with the - the Hassel-blad, the EL camera.|||CC|Oh, okay; got you.|||CC|We had FAO working on matching that one up.||02 20 45 34|LMP|Okay.||02 20 48 28|LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead, Jack.|||LMP|Roger. That weak front that I talked about south of Australia yesterday has moved north, but it looks considerably weaker than it did yesterday even. Just a very thin line of clouds - very thin line of clouds that now is touching the - the tip of Australia, south of Perth.||02 20 51 06|LMP|Houston, 17. I think maybe you dropped out before I said that little weak front moving north-northeast, south of Australia. The western end of||||||||Tape 47/13||||it is just touching the coast of Australia, south of Perth, but it looks much weaker; and I, right now, would not expect very much weather out of it.|||CC|Okay. That - I can't tie up with you on that one, Jack, because my prog doesn't go down that far; it only stays up in the landing area. And my satellite photo doesn't go down that far south either. So, I can't touch up with you on that one.|||LMP|Okay. Well, it - it looked stronger yesterday, and it might have developed. Now there is a larger disturbance at the southeastern end of that front, still south of Tasmania; although, I suspect, unless it stays on a pretty northerly course, it will not affect the weather on the east coast of Australia very much.|||CC|Roger.||02 20 53 05|CC|Jack, just thought you might be interested. I called same friends of yours in Tucson, and everybody's fine there and wanted to say hello and tell you everybody's fine and getting along real good.|||LMP|Thank you very much. Good to hear. They've learned to take care of themselves pretty well, haven't they?|||CC|They sure have. They - they're - they're having a little trouble with the squawk box, and we'll get working on that and it's - they're having trouble reading a little bit, but they're keeping up with us.|||LMP|That's nothing new.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|But try to fix it, please.|||CC|Oh, we'll - definitely on that one.||02 20 53 59|LMP|Bob, Ron got you all - the Earth down there zeroed in in the sextant, and it puts my little binocular to shame. I tell you, it's a fine instrument.||||||Tape 47/14||||||And I'll just confirm that the - that disturbance over the So - Solomon Islands is an awfully tightly wound little storm system. And right now, I finally have see New Zealand for the first time in a couple of days, for sure. And the South Island's got some, probably high cirrus over it. North Island looks pretty clear. That's the end that I can get right now.|||CC|Roger. We saw you looking at Regulus there; we didn't realize you were looking at the Earth instead.|||LMP|Ron's been looking for the booster. And he called me down and asked me to look at the Earth. He's been holding out on me.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Pass the torch of weather forecasting to Ron.||02 20 55 22|CC|Hey, Jack. I also have some words for you and Gene. Got some advice from the home front. The thing to do with Ron in the future is to hook up a Baby Ben and a metal dishpan. It works every time, if you want to wake him up.|||CMP|No. I think that's not a good way.|||CC|Ron, everybody's fine over at El Lago. They are doing great. Listening to every word.|||CMP|Very good, Bob. Thank you very much.|||CDR|Hey, Bob. We got two of those flashers out there. They could be SLA panels. I don't know. They're alike in intensity and pretty regular in the - in the intensity, bright and dim flashes they come out with, and they're widely separated. One is about the position we called at the first time; the other one is - oh, as I'm looking at the Earth, far to the left. Closer to the center window now.||02 20 56 52|CC|Roger.||02 21 01 07|LMP|Houston, 17.||||||||Tape 47/15|||CC|Go ahead.|||LMP|Yes, Bob, what is your - analysis chart, if you have it - surface terms analysis chart show for Hawaii today?|||CC|Stand by on that.|||CC|Jack, according to the - -|||LMP|The reason I ask is that for using your term -Go ahead.|||CC|No, go ahead on that, Jack.|||LMP|I was going to say, using your terminator time as a partial - mark for where Hawaii ought to be, Hawaii ought to be, it looks like that cyclonic circulation at the north end of the cloud bank I described, approaching that area, would be just about on the Hawa - Hawaiian Islands. I'm curious if they're getting some weather down there now.|||CC|Stand by right now; I've got my weatherman right beside me here.|||LMP|Also, that major front we talked about last night as being east and south of Japan has progressed even farther and is, oh, maybe 20 degrees longitude - about 20 degrees longitude from the Hawaiian Islands. And I'm making some guesses on exactly where Hawaii is.|||CC|Roger, Jack. We've got nothing adverse in the Hawaiian area at all. Just a lot of winds, high winds and surface winds and surface roughness, but we don't have any bad cloud area in the Hawaiian area. I'll get the Hickam sequence report here shortly, Jack.|||LMP|Okay, ... a little bit. The - our zero-phase point is now centered just a little south of the disturbance near the Solomon Islands. And I see no distinct change in the intensity of that zero-phase point over what I had talked about a couple hours ago.||||||Tape 47/16||||02 21 04 23|CC|Roger, Jack. The Solomon Islands disturbance and everything is confirmed on this chart that I've got. It's very definitely confirmed in there.|||LMP|Okay. Well, it's a lot more obvious today than it was yesterday; but even then it was showing pretty strong circulation. It is starting to wrap up, look very much like Therese did yesterday.|||CC|Roger. I'm sure of that. The one right off of Vietnam is also pretty tight, isn't it still?|||LMP|Well, we can't see that one yet.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Australia in general is still very clear except in the northeastern portions where it looks like they have got scattered clouds; but it looks like a pretty night - over Australia.|||CC|Roger. Looks that way from the satellite photo from the last couple days. Looks pretty nice down there.||02 21 05 34|LMP|Right.||02 21 07 05|CC|Jack, in looking at the sequence reports for Hickam and Hilo and that area, it looks like they just got their standard 3500 scattered, 4500 broken clouds, maybe a rain shower or two. But just their standard tropical fluffy clouds.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 48/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||02 21 12 35|CMP|Houston, Apollo 17.|||CC|Go ahead, Ron.||02 21 12 45|CMP|Bob, I don't know whether I told you or not, but we ended up with the LMP and the CDRs suit .in the bottom of this suit bag. tty suit is in the top, and I sure don't have any idea how in the world the other crews got three suits in there. I guess they never did because these things are plumb full right now, of suits, ... suit bag. And it's a good thing we lengthened them. I don't have room for anything else inside the suit bag. The water bags and, you know, contingency water bags, and my g-suit, and those flight things are - I found a place to stick them all around the wall on the outside of the suit bag.|||CC|Roger, Ron. Good work.||02 21 13 50|LMP|Bob, you made some comment earlier about the weather. It may have been Hawaii, but you broke up.||02 21 13 56|CC|Roger; I just got the sequence report for Hawaii, and Hickam had 3500, scattered; 4500, broken with minor rain showers; and Hilo had about the same. And basically, it's just their tropical puffy weather out there. The typical nothing. No frontal-type weather - no cyclonic-type weather.|||LMP|Okay. Well, it may be just patterns induced by the - the wind currents, or maybe I don't have the position of Hawaii quite right.|||CC|Well, it's - it's possible. You know they do have high winds out there, and I've seen it, just flying in that area in the past, where those broken clouds get pretty close together at times. It almost looks like a solid overcast. And especially when you look at it from an angle, they all blend together.||||||Tape 48/2|||||LMP|I hope you're going to save all those charts you're gathering together as we talk about it on this outbound leg. Be interesting to compare them and the pictures we take sometime in January.||02 21 15 18|CC|Jack, the Weather just was out here, and they told me that's exactly what they're doing. And if your time will permit in January, they'd like to go through and maybe help piece them all together, but they're going through these transcripts and they're gathering all their satellite pictures and plotting what you're seeing versus the satellite pictures etc., etc. And they'd like to go over it with you when you get back.|||LMP|I'd love to do that. I hope, in general, we're getting the directions right. At least, I know I thought I'd worry about the descriptions, and it's hard to place points on the globe, particularly in the Pacific, if you can't identify land masses near them or have those nice little latitude and longitude lines painted on the Earth.|||CC|Well, that's right We'll - we'll put in a request for some lat - long lines out there,||02 21 17 15|CC|Jack, we're going to have a slight changeover from Goldstone to Honeysuckle at 72 hours, so we will probably break by.|||LMP|Okay. Bob, you know you're just the last turn or so, you started to break up occasionally as if you might be getting a bad mike button or something.|||CC|Okay, I'll check it out,||02 21 22 49|CC|17, Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read?|||CDR|You're loud and clear, Bob.|||CC|Roger. Samo, saao.||02 21 28 15|LMP|Houston, 17-|||CC|Go ahead.||||||||Tape 48/3||02 21 28 23|LMP|I's just playing with the polarizing filter again, and it looks as if - when you have the knob on the filter parallel to the - roughly parallel to the polar axis of the Earth, - you get maximum darkening. And, of course, the opposite 90 degrees to that you get maximum lightening of the globe. And, in the - in the case of Australia, it also appears to lighten and darken, but not to the extent of the - of the ocean areas.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|It could be that in the more desert climate you get finer grain materia.! on the ground and give you the response that John Dietrich had talked about.|||CC|Roger.||02 21 31 02|LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead, Jack.|||LMP|I rechecked that little story I was trying to give you about the ice pack there in the Ross Sea.|||CC|Roger.||02 21 31 16|LMP|And whether I was right a couple of days ago or not - whether I was right a couple of days ago or not in the patterns, right now there is a lot of open water between the ice pack and the inner or, let's say, southern and south - eastern shore of the sea that I don't recall being there the other day.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I don't know whether you have any connections with all the Marines stationed in Antarctica, but maybe somebody knows what the ice pack's been doing the last few days.|||CC|I'll - I'll see if we can find out, Jack. I don't think we've got any gates in Antarctica, though.||||||Tape 48/4|||||LMP|Well, that way you can't lose any.|||CC|Roger. Well, they never stole the continent.|||LMP|Sounds like pretty good duty, Bob.||02 21 51 13|LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go ahead, 17-|||LMP|Yes, I - may have misled you earlier about a storm system south of Tasmania. It's - If there is one, it's just developing, and it's probably 20 degrees of longitude south. As I recall yesterday, there was some indication that a couple fronts were joining forces and moving in that direction. Today, the weaker and more western front appears to have dominated the system, and the only area where there seems to be cyclonic circulation developing is -is that point way south of Tasmania. That conceivably might move up and affect New Zealand in a few, in a couple days, but right now I don't see how it could affect Australia.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||02 22 15 30|CC|17, Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead, Bob.|||CC|I just wanted to give you fair warning, Jack. In case you all feel a bump there when you're about ready to go to sleep there. At 73:17:45, you'll cross that magic line into the lunar sphere of influence.||02 22 15 53|CDR|What's the number, Bob?|||CC|73:17:45.||02 22 16 06|CDR|Bob, do you read us?|||CC|Roger.

I'm reading - reading 17 loud and clear.||02 22 16 33|CDR|Okay, this is Geno. What was that number on the lunar sphere of influence?||02 22 16 37|CC|73 hours 17 minutes 45 seconds: 73:17:45.|||CDR|Okay, Bob. You're a little intermittent. Anyway, what you mean is we start hauling the mail I gue***.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|I guess we hit our slowest point. How fast are we going now?||02 22 17 47|CC|Gene, you're pretty slow today. You're at 2354 feet per second.|||CDR|Yes. That's - that's quite a drop from the 35 K that the S-IVB put us on.|||CC|That's for sure.|||CDR|Say, Bob. What do you hear from my home front? Anything?|||CC|Talked to Tracy a little while ago, and she's listening to the box quite often and enjoying it, and everybody's fine there.||02 22 18 33|CDR|Bob, you're continuing ... We're getting every third word.||02 22 18 55|CC|Gene, do you read me any better on this one?||02 22 19 13|CC|17, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead, Bob.|||CC|How do you read me now?||02 22 19 27|CDR|I think you're still ... off.||||||Tape 48/6||||02 22 19 30|CC|Roger; you're breaking up on us, too. Let's check it through here a minute.|||CDR|Okay.||02 22 19 47|CC|We were wondering who was going to be wearing the headset tonight, Jack. Who's got the duty?||02 22 20 15|CC|17, Houston.||02 22 24 35|CDR|Hey, Bob. You reading us now?||02 22 25 10|CC|17, Houston, did you call?|||CDR|I just wondered if you're reading us now, Bob.||02 22 25 25|CC|Roger. Reading you now loud and clear. I was just off a minute there, talking to Barbara on the phone. Everybody's fine on the home front, Gene.|||CDR|Okay, what did you say Tracy said earlier?|||CC|She just said she's tickled pink and listening -listening on the squawk box.|||CDR|I guess that's the way a 9-year-old daughter should be in a case like this, huh?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||CDR|In case she's not listening, tell her not to forget to feed the horses.|||CC|Roger. Barbara said I should find some nice young female voice around here to tell you she loves you, good night. But I figure we'd better not do that.|||CDR|Okay; enough said. I guess what we don't need right (chuckle) right now is a nice female voice.|||CC|I'm sure of that.|||CDR|We're just happy, health - healthy, hungry, and homesick.||||||||Tape 48/7|||CC|You got a lot of work to do, and you better not say you're hungry. The doctor about went through the overhead over here when you said that.|||CDR|That's a cliche.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Bob, just in general, how is the spacecraft looking to you? Pretty good, I hope.|||CC|That's affirmative. We - we haven't found anything I guess we're - stopped getting those spurious MASTER ALARMs here for a while. So that - that was the only witch hunt we were having right there, was trying to find that.|||CDR|Yes, they disappeared. The ones we've had recently seem to be real ones.|||CC|Roger.||02 22 27 58|CC|Hey, guys, we were just still trying to figure out who is going to wear the headset and got - who has the duty tonight?|||CDR|Oh, I'll wear it tonight, Bob.|||CC|Is that Gene?|||CDR|Yes.|||CC|Okay.||02 22 28 30|CMP|And, Houston; 17.

We can see the Sinai, can see the Red Sea, the Sea of Aden, and for the first time I think we can not only see the Mediterranean, but we can see the - most of the Southern European countries, Turkey and Greece and up into Italy and some of those places, can't quite see Spain because you're just about on the horizon. And for the most part, it looks like the weather throughout the Mediterranean and Northern Africa looks pretty good.||||||Tape 54/2|||||CC|Okay, we're copying that.

We were getting a lot of noise down here, and we seem to think that you guys were prob - assumed you guys were turned away from us or something. But we're with you.|||CMP|No, you might think about that one a little bit. We had a very strong up-link - signal strength, as good as right now.

Your friendly medical officer has all the good words starting with the CDR and the food. Are you ready to copy?|||CC|Ready to copy.|||LMP|Okay. It was a big day yesterday, eatingwise. CDR had sausage patties, pears, and cocoa for breakfast. And a quarter - one-fourth cheese spread, one-half bread, and one-half cereal bar, and one orange beverage. For lunch. Tomato soup, half a hamburger, half mustard, vanilla pudding, and an orange-pineapple drink for dinner.|||CC|Okay, copy that.|||LMP|... 5 hours of good sleep, and two more containers of water.|||CC|Okay, 17, I got the CDRs food and then you broke up, and I got 5 hours of sleep and two containers of water. Was there something between?|||LMP|That's firm, your - his PRD reading, 17032.|||CC|Okay, copy that.|||LMP|And I think, Bob, we're coming around different omni, so I'll wait on the rest of it.||||||Tape 54/4||||03 07 23 59|CC|Roger, That's affirm.||03 07 26 55|LMP|Okay, Houston; 17. How do you read now?|||CC|Okay, read you again; go ahead.|||LMP|Okay, for the LMP, the food eaten - Well, let's see, I guess it's a tossup: eaten versus not eaten, so I'll give you what I ate. Sausage patties, grits, pears, pineapple-grapefruit drink, coffee, and let me make a note that the package of peaches in that pack had been - was broken in the package. Also, chicken - I had chicken soup, ham, bread, orange drink, and four bacon squares. For dinner, I sort of ate some leftovers and grape drink, corn chowder, chocolate pudding. And I've had - Well, stand by. The PRD reading: 24080; and 7-1/2 hours of very good sleep last night. I took a Seconal in order to get to sleep, and I've had 1 and 1 or - 2-1/2 containers of water since last report.|||CC|Okay, copy all that, Jack.|||LMP|Okay, the CMP, the chowhound of the kennel here, had: sausage, grits, fruit cocktail, orange beverage, and coffee. He had ham, cheese spread, peaches, cereal bar, and orange-pineapple drink. Later on, he had tomato soup, half a hamburger, half mustard, vanilla pudding, sugar cookies, grape drink, and tea. And he has a complaint this morning, much like mine, that his apricot package had broken in the bag; and, although not too significant itself, it makes everything else pretty sticky.|||CC|I copy that.|||LMP|Okay, CMP medical is 15031 PRD; he had 7 hours restless sleep, and he'd like a comment from the doctors on how that looked on his biomed; and he had a Seconal, and he's had four containers of water.|||CC|Okay, we copy all that one also. Jack, you guys still going to fit in your space suits?||||||||Tape 54/5|||LMP|If you'd stick around - you'd know we tried those on yesterday.|||CC|Roger; copy. Tried to talk to you guys yesterday morning, but I didn't quite make it, there was a problem apparently some place.|||LMP|That's all right, we're stuffing him with food so he can't sleep.||03 07 30 43|CC|Okay, and the comment concerning Ron's sleep from the Surgeon, Jack, is that he was restless the first hour and had periods of restlessness during the night, but we logged him for about 7 hours of sleep also. But we did see periods of wakefulness, sane of which were maybe up to 10 minutes long.|||CMP|That sounds about right; that's good, thank you. If I can't tell how long I'm awake and, you know, how long you were really asleep.|||CC|I'll tell you, Ron, if you wake up during the night, you might sit there and stare at the second hand then maybe you could count and tell how long you're awake.|||CMP|(Laughter) Okay.|||CC|Okay, we owe you guys a consumable update - update. And on RCS consumables, your RCS fuel remaining is still 1.4 percent above the Flight Plan; that's a slight improvement over the 1,3 percent from yesterday.||03 07 32 19|LMP|I guess everything else is about like yesterday. Is that right, Bob?|||CC|Roger. The consumables are still about the same. And if you guys will wind your watches, we'll consider the postsleep checklist finished.|||LMP|Okay, and Geno has got his null bias check for you.|||CC|Okay, Roger on that. We're waiting.|||CDR|Okay, Bob, made two checks over a period of 100 seconds. One was minus 99-0 and the other was minus 98*9-||||||Tape 54/6|||||CC|Okay, we copy minus 99-0 and minus 98.9? Geno.|||CDR|And - -||03 07 33 21|CC|And we'd like OMNI Charlie, please there, 17.||03 07 35 26|CC|And, Apollo 17; Houston. We'd like to recommend you go SQUELCH, OFF, at this time, if you haven't; and we'll keep calling you the omnis to change as you rotate there. Over.|||LMP|Okay, Bob, we've been flying normally with it enabled; maybe you think that's the problem.|||CC|Stand by on that and, while we're thinking about it, can we confirm that the only medication you've had is a Seconal for you and a Seconal for Ron, and nothing for the Commander?|||CDR|This is Geno, that's right; I did not take any Seconal last night. One thing I wanted to talk to you about though, I - I took one antigas pill after breakfast, I took one after supper, and I took one prior to going to sleep, which were probably within an hour apart. If you've got a better solution than those gas pills, I'd sure like to hear it|||CC|Understand that, Gene. We'll get back with you, I guess, on that later.||03 07 37 20|CC|And, Jack, as far as turning the SQUELCH, OFF, I -they do believe that we're better with that for margins and general management at this distance with the omni. As soon as we plot a PTC and go on the high gain, we'll be much better off.|||LMP|Okay, Bob.||03 07 38 46|CC|And, 17; Houston. You can do without your water dump now. We're in good shape. We'll dump at 94 hours.|||CDR|94 hours. Okay.|||CDR|Bob, does that mean we can go ahead with the urine dump on schedule?||||||||Tape 54/7|||CC|Say again there, Geno, on the urine dump.|||CC|Say again, Geno, on the urine dump.|||CDR|Roger. Can we press on with it on schedule?|||CC|That's affirmative, sir. It's Just that we don't need to do the water dump, that's all.|||CDR|Oh.|||CDR|Okay, fine.||03 07 44 41|LMP|Hello, Hou - Houston; 17. How do you read?|||CC|Roger. We have you back again, 17.|||CDR|Okay. We may play the S-band squelch by ear, a||||little bit. We got an awful lot of noise when you guys drop off the line. So, if that's all right, we'll just use it as required. Also, I'm on frame l63 on the Hasselblad, and I just completed two pictures of the Earth about 5 minutes ago. And there's one that I did not report late yesterday at about 72:30 GET. A set of two pictures of the Earth.|||CC|Copy that.|||CC|Say again that time. Was that 78:30? You were sleeping then.|||CDR|Negative. That was 72:30.|||CC|Okay. Copy that. And part of the reason we had a little problem that - this - this last time, Jack, was we planned to call the omnis and we didn't get the word around down here. And we didn't call the omni to you in time. We're still planning on doing that, and I think we'll be more coordinated next time.|||LMP|Okay. We'll bear with you.||||||Tape 54/8|||||CC|And, Jack, I presume that's magazine November November.||03 07 46 53|LMP|That1s affirm, Bob.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 55/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||03 07 50 24|CC|OMNI Charlie, 17, please.|||CMP|You got it.|||CC|And, Apollo 17; Houston.

Did you catch the midcourse-4 scrub?|||LMP|Yes, sir. Apparently, you're not getting some of our acknowledgements.|||CC|Okay, must be. Captain Young here wants to tell you that it's raining outside; and the paperboy apparently hasn't come in yet. OMNI Delta, please.|||CDR|I'm surprised he didn't get his papers delivered before he came in.|||CC|Roger. I suppose I should apologize to all the paperboys after saying that, but the news is still being put together for you guys. And - stand by.|||CC|And, Geno, some advice to you on the gas pills. I guess - suggestion down here from the Surgeon is that one thing we ought to be sure to do is chew the pills thoroughly. It apparently is - helps in their effectiveness quite a bit; and Dr. Young, beside me, also suggested if you're chewing chewing gum, you might cut down on that a bit because he thinks this might be causing some gas.|||CDR|Thank you.||||||Tape 55/2||||03 07 56 Ul|CDR|I might add that both of those alternatives have been - worked on.|||CC|We thought probably so.|||LMP|Bob, although we're getting close to concentrating our attention on the Moon, it doesn't decrease the interest in looking back at the patterns of activity we can see on the Earth. That storm I talked about yesterday that was in North Africa, looks like it has left that area and has moved in - maybe, if it's there at all, it's just over the - Iberian Peninsula, And maybe Gibraltar and that area is getting a little activity today.|||CC|Okay; copy that, Jack.|||LMP|It does not look very well organized, but - it's not very well organized right now, but - it's right out on the LM, and it's hard to get a good view of it.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|The storm I guessed yesterday - I thought might be moving into the Cape of Good Hope looks like it's dissipating and also staying south of that area. Hie whole of Africa is essentially clear, except in the southern part of the intertropical convergence area where there's scattered patches of - of fairly dense clouds. They're probably getting scattered rain showers of some kind in there this morning. Some of those extend farther south than I've - than we've seen them - down into South Africa. There's a - On one of the earlier revs, although now it's at the terminator, it looked like there was a depression developing about 30 degrees longitude, east of Madagascar in the middle of the Indian Ocean. A little bit northeast of Madagascar, there's also a new area of clouds developed that looks like it's getting organized into a cyclone pattern.|||CC|Roger. OMNI Alfa, please.|||LMP|Okay, you got it.||||||||Tape 55/3|||CC|Thank you.|||CC|Okay. And, Jack, while you guys are finishing your lunch - your breakfast there, excuse me - Are you all on your headsets?|||LMP|Yes, sir. Go ahead.||03 08 00 06|CC|Okay. Let me brief you on a little funny that we we saw last night. And I'll start the briefing by mentioning that, at the present time, it is not a great concern; but just to keep you up to date with what's going on, let me mention it to you. About 70 hours, which was probably about the time of your last exercise period, we saw three funnies with the hydrogen tanks - as I say, none of which is causing any great concern. The first of these was a shift of the limits of the pressure switch, the one that turns the heaters on and off. Remember, there are two of those switches, one on tank 1 and one on tank 2 and they work in series. And one of those switches - we can't tell which, but we suspect it's probably tank 2 because of the other funnies I'll get to in a minute on tank 2 -one of those switches went from a 13-psi range; in other words, a plus or minus 6.5-psi range. It changed its range down to plus or minus 1.5 psi. So it's now - its total range is only 3 psi. The main result of that is that it means that the pressure switches and the motor switch turning the heater on acts more frequently over shorter periods of time. The second thing which we observed following this - and we're not at all sure if there is any correlation between this and the others - We observed a high-frequency pressure oscillation in tank 2. It was about a 5-psi peak-to-peak oscillation, a frequency of about 2 cycles per second. And this lasted about 3 to 5 minutes. A third funny that we observed - and this was in tank 2 - the third funny that we observed was an erratic - and possibly correlated with the high-frequency oscillation - but an erratic total fuel cell currents, and here again we were looking at -oh, peak-to-peak variations of something like 5 amps, or of 5 to 10 amps. And the suspicion is that, coupled with the shift in the limits of the pressure switch, some acoustic vibrations were set||||||Tape 55/4||||||"up in that tank - we may have seen them causing the oscillation of the motor switch, which was then reflected in the fuel cell currents. The - again, these erratic and possibly correlated fuel cell currents lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes. And since then, all during the night, they've [sic] been no further events of this sort; and the pressure switch with its reduced limits has been acting quite normally, just with the reduced limits overnight . As I say again, we're looking at it, people are studying it in great detail, with no real answer at the moment; but there is no great concern at present, And it appears that the worst that can happen is for the motor switch to ""stale"" because of overuse. And if this were to happen, it would force us to go to man - manual management of the heaters on the H2 tank. But that appears at the moment to be the worst, that we can anticipate from this - from this group of funnies. Over."||03 08 03 40|CDR|Okay, Bob. I understand that. You know, I wonder if we ought to stop stirring the cryos the way we've been doing it.|||CC|That - that has been suggested, but - but, again, it's not very clear that any of these things are terribly correlated.|||CDR|Okay. Also, you know, if you want to reduce the activity on that switch - depending on how much you need to have it done during quiet periods, such as eat periods and things like that - we could go to manual operation.|||CC|Negative, Jack, because the switch - OMNI Bravo, please, 17.|||CC|... If you pull out your schematics there, you'll find that the - no matter what you do, the - you can turn the thing off, in fact, and the switch will continue to operate the motor switch - the pressure switch will continue to operate the motor switch off the service module buses. There's nothing you can do. The only thing you'll do if you go from AUTO to MANUAL or OFF is you'll keep the current from going to the heaters, but the motor switch will still operate.||||||||Tape 55/5|||CDR|Okay. Thank you for the education.|||CC|And I've been corrected. The frequency of the pressure oscillation was more in the vicinity of a cycle every 4 or 5 seconds.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|And 7 - -|||LMP|Bob, let me ask a couple of questions to make sure - -||03 08 06 26|CC|Go ahead.|||LMP|Make sure I understand this. You're not sure whether the heater cycling and the pressure cycling were correlated. Is that correct?|||CC|That's affirmative.|||LMP|In a cycle very 4 or 5 seconds, is it possible for the heaters to affect the tank that fast?|||CC|That's not possible, so the only thing that really -we think could - The tank is too much of a heat sink to do it that way. What may have happened was that if you set up an oscillation - a mechanical oscillation in the tank - through - one way or another, that this could then have acted back up on the motor But the motor switch in driving the heaters could not have reinforced the oscillation because the tank is too much of a heat sink.|||LMP|Okay. When did you say this happened with respect to our exercise period?|||CC|That's not well pinned down, 17. We do know it hasn't occurred since about 71 hours; and it did occur at approximately 70 hours, which was about the time of your exercise period. But we haven't been able to correlate that exactly with the start of or the finish of the exercise period.||||||Tape 55/6||||03 08 08 56|LMP|Well, you know you should be able to do that because of the biomed on - at least on me, and Ron was on, too. But, as soon as I started exercising, you should have the biomed data on my heart rate. It was an unscheduled exercise period. We just went into it before an eat period there, I think. Let me check back.|||CC|Okay. And we can check back and inform you more specific on what the times were there in terms of your exercise period, also. I'd like OMNI Charlie, please, there, 17. And we might mention that oscillations like this have been seen on the ground under somewhat different circumstances, but oscillations like this have been seen on the ground in ground tests previously. And I might say, also, that as far as other things in the spacecraft are concerned, everything looks absolutely normal or nominal, as the case may be, and in great shape and emph - I'd emphasize again that we've seen none of this oscillation again since 71 hours. Over.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. That was, as you say, pretty close to the exercise. I can't pin it down in the checklist exactly, but it was somewhere after ALFMED was complete and before we changed that canister. I think we changed that canister a little early, about 70:50 So I think the medic should have pretty good data on when we were exercising. And the reason I say that was because the way we were -I was exercising anyway -I'm sort of running in place against the LEB and conceivably could have gotten an oscillation going in the tank.|||CC|Roger. Understand that.||03 08 13 55|CC|OMNI Delta, 17.|||CC|And, 17, we did a little - a little investigation of times down here. We found that at 71:12 you were exercising at 130 beats per minute, Jack. And we think the exercise period ended about 10 minutes later at 71:22. The H2 tank funnies started at about 71:37 with the pressure switch shift and 71;^2 with the oscillations. Over. So, there it's - oh, at least 15 minutes after the exercise period was over.||||||||Tape 55/7|||LMP|Okay. I just wanted to clear my reputation, Bob. Now it's perfectly clean again.||03 08 14 02|CC|As clean as ever, anyway.|||CC|Okay. 17, I guess we decided we'd let - we'll run the omnis down here instead of having you guys push them all the time. So if you'll select OMNI Bravo at the present time, then we'll take over and run the omnis for you.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. It's not too big a deal. If anytime you think you want to talk to us continuously, go ahead and call them, if we're not busy.|||CC|Okay. Copy that. Let us know when you're ready. I've got a pad here for you guys to copy, but there's no big hurry on it. Finish your eat period and give us a call.|||LMP|Okay. I'll be with you in about 5 minutes.|||CC|Say again there, 17,|||LMP|Be right with you, Bob.|||CC|All right.||03 08 15 36|CDR|And, looking at the Flight Plan, we're going to go ahead and change a canister; and we've got the H2 purge LINE HEATERS, ON. We're going to configure for the urine dump. We'll go ahead and do our -stop our PTC at 83:30, and then we'll do our P52.|||CC|Roger. Copy that.|||CC|And, 17, that P52 at 83:10 was primarily intended for the MCC-4. There's some more following, anyway, before LOI. So we suggest you scrub the P52 at 83:10.|||CMP|Okay, fine. I may just do a little OJT without torquing.|||CC|That's your business.||||||Tape 55/8||||03 08 17 40|CDR|Bob, when we come out of PTC, then you want us to go right to the SIM door jett attitude?|||CC|That1s affirmative, 17.|||CDR|Okay, and you want us to do that about 80 - 83:30, huh?|||CC|Roger. That's affirm.|||CDR|Okay.|||LMP|Bob, what pad are you going to give me?|||CC|Okay, I've got a - coming up, pericynthion - plus-2-hour abort pad here.|||CC|17, Houston.||03 08 21 4l|LMP|Yes, Bob. Here 1s 17. Say, for a while here, why don't you guys go ahead and manage the omnis. I think we can get things done a little better; and when it becomes inconvenient for us to switch, we'll let you know.|||CC|Okay. You want us to call them to you - Is that what you're saying by you manag - we manage the omnis?|||LMP|Yes, we lose 5 or 10 minutes going around here  without comm, and it usually breaks up seemingly when somebody has something to say, either you or us.|||CC|Roger. Okay. That's fine. Stand by.|||LMP|That's up to you guys, but, it seems to me, it would be more convenient.|||CC|Okay; things are good now, Jack. Do you want to copy this pericynthion-plus-2 pad at the present time?|||LMP|Yes, I'm just about ready, Bob.||||||||Tape 55/9|||CC|Okay, give me a call when you get it. And, while you're getting ready there, you might think back to yesterday afternoon just after the exercise period; and the question that's raised is whether you were running the DAC or some other miscellaneous equipment at that time which might have caused some high current usage - or erratic current usage.|||LMP|We'll think about that, Bob; but, offhand, none of us can remember doing anything like that.|||CC|Okay; copy that.||03 08 26 17|CC|OMNI Charlie, 17.|||CC|And, 17, your faithful nigjht shift capcomm is signing off. I'll talk to you on the surface tomorrow. Good luck.|||CDR|Thank you, Robert. Looking forward to seeing you there.|||LMP|Are you leaving us, Bob?|||CC|That's affirm; he's already left,||03 08 28 02|LMP|Boy, he doesn't stick around long, does he? And he wanted to read that pad to me; well, that's too bad. Okay, Gordy, I can take the pad now.|||CC|Okay, Jack. It's pericynthion plus 2; SPS/G&N. Weight is 66373; plus 1.18, minus 0.l4; ignition time is 090:49:55.82; plus 1787.5, minus 1891.7, minus 2396.8; attitude is 237, 126, 332; and all the rest of the PAD is NA. GDC align stars are Sirius and Rigel; 122; 354; 000. Ullage is none. Remarks: number 1, burn docked; number 2, assumes LOI REFSMMAT. Over.|||LMP|Okay. Pericynthion plus 2, SPS/G&N; 66373, 1 -plus 1.18, minus 0.14; 090:49:55-82; plus 1787.5, minus 1891.7, minus 2396.8; 237, 126, 332; rest of pad is NA; Sirius and Rigel; 122; 354; 000. No ullage. Remark 1, burn docked; 2 is LOI REFSMMAT assumed.||||||Tape 55/10|||||CC|That's correct.||03 08 30 49|CC|Need OMNI Delta now.||03 08 31 41|CMP|Houston, 17. Canister change complete.|||CC|Okay.||03 08 35 10|CC|America, switch to OMNI Alfa.||03 08 37 38|CC|America, Houston. I have the morning news at the convenient time.|||LMP|Fire away, Gordo.|||CC|Okay, first of all the weather. It's raining fairly - fairly heavily all night; there's a lot of water standing around. Temperatures here are in the high 50's, but it's supposed to get a little cooler tonight with a low in the 40's. I think you know how the Dallas-Redskin game came out - the only thing additional mentioned here is that chances look good now that Washington and Dallas may meet in the rubber games for the National Conference representative in the Super Bowl. In the other pro game yesterday, a field goal by Don Cockroft was the difference in a 26-to-24 win by Cleveland over rival Cincinnati. Other sports highlights: The Pittsburgh Steelers play the Oilers today in the Dome. Other big games will be Atlanta at San Francisco, Green Bay at Minnesota, and Baltimore at Kansas City. Tennessee State beat Drake University in the Pioneer Bowl 29 to 7. And East Texas State beat Carson Newman in the NAIA football playoffs. The Southwest Conference has pulled out of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Some college basketball scores: The Houston Cougars routed Xavier last night out at Hofheinz Pavilion 114 to 73; and Rice downed George Washington 93 to 89. Geno, you'll be glad to hear Purdue ripped TCU 101 to 70, and it was Texas over Oklahoma State 86 to 66. And SMU over Oklahoma City 106 to 83. We couldn't find any score at Cal Tech, Jack, but -Switch to OMNI Bravo, please. But one final score, Ron, Kansas lost to Iowa 69 to 56. The only thing new on the plane crash Friday in Chicago - it's reported here that the plane was apparently waved||||||||Tape 55/H||||off because another plane was still on the assigned runway. The Democratic Party's stormy session in Washington saw the old-guard Democrats apparently take back control of the Party from pro-McGovern forces. Mrs. Jean Westwood was replaced as Party Chairman by Texas lawyer/businessman Robert Strauss. Former-president Truman appears to be more than holding his own at a hospital in Kansas City. There's a good chance the 88-year-old former Chief Executive may be taken off the critical list. There's been a 1-day interruption in the secret peace talks between Dr. Henry Kissinger and Le Due Tho. The two conferred for over 3 hours yesterday. Both sides have agreed not to talk to newsmen on any substantive matters. In other news highlights, President Nixon has named Daniel Moynihan as U.S. Arabata - Ambassador to India. And Chilean President Allende has flown to Cuba to vis - to visit Fidel Castro. Here's an interesting one. A 45-year-old pilot lost in the Arctic for 31 days has been found alive and well. Three companions were killed. The Soviet Party boss Leonid Breshnev has delayed a scheduled visit to the U.S. It looks as if the visit may come in the fall rather than this coming spring. One last note: The news media says that the flight of Apollo 17 is the smoothest on record so far, and I call that last one pretty accurate reporting. Over.||03 08 42 11|LMP|Thank you, Gordo, appreciate the news. Sounds like things are still happening down there.|||CC|Got some more parochial news here - -|||LMP|Houston, we're starting our -|||CC|Go ahead.||03 08 42 44|LMP|No, we just - I just wanted to tell you we're starting our waste dumps.||||||Tape 55/12|||||CC|Okay. A little more parochial news. I have your oxygen consumable status here. Tank 1 is still running 4 percent below the line; the other two are right on the line; really no news there. Same with the hydrogen; all three are essentially right on the preflight lines. Over.|||LMP|Okay, that's the way like to hear it.|||LMP|We'll bring all of it home if we can.|||CC|Okay.||03 08 44 08|CC|We'd like OMNI Charlie, please.||03 08 48 49|CC|Need OMNI Delta now.||03 08 49 08|CMP|Okay, Gordy. How would you like a hydrogen purge this morning?|||CC|... make sure.|||CMP|Go ahead, Houston; 17.|||CC|17, we do want the hydrogen purge; go ahead.|||CMP|Okay, hydrogen purge is in process. You'd never believe it, dust collection container assembly serial number 5725 developed a hole in it. Fortunately, with a lot of dexterity, I was able to put a piece of tape over the hole.|||CC|Okay. I guess that's why we sent men into space.|||CMP|(Laughter) Right.|||LMP|Gordy, while the purges are going on here, I might mention, a little while ago, I looked at the Earth througih a Polaroid colored glass again and had a full view of Africa. And it appeared as if, in the red and yellow portions of Africa, that the land areas darkened considerably more than those areas that are green or foliated, and that would be the central portion; that is, they darkened with the orien - handle on the lens going in a north-south rather than east-west.||||||||Tape 55/13|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|The land areas, though, still do not show as marked a contrast as do the oceans.|||CC|Roger,||03 08 53 21|CC|We'd like OMNI Alfa.|||LMP|Okay, hydrogen purge is complete. HEATER is going OFF.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Gordy, it looks like the cloudiness and possibly the showers associated with the intertropical convergence over Africa are moving as far south as Johannesburg right now. It's quite a distinct change from even an - an hour or so ago - a couple of hours ago. They're down into an area where, presumably, they're not normally found if vegetation indications are any criteria. And also, in the Atlantic - South Atlantic near Goa Island, there seems to be a possible storm developing as part of what was probably now a fairly weak front. And whether or not that will develop into anything and move in towards Capetown is hard to say at this time.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|It looks as if our old friends at Ascension are enjoying a fairly nice day out there.|||CC|Roger.||03 08 57 44|CC|OMNI Bravo, please.|||CC|Jack, this is Houston. We recall you mentioning the purge complete and the heaters off. We just wanted to be sure that you did leave the H2 purge line heaters on for 10 minutes after terminating the purge. Over.|||LMP|Thank you, Gordy. I'll turn them back on.||||||Tape 55/14|||||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Who's sitting over there reminding me of all these good things this morning?|||CC|Well, that was a combination effort by John Aaron and Charlie Dumis.|||LMP|Wow! You've got a real powerful team there.|||CC|You bet.|||LMP|Hey, you really ought to get them a cup of coffee though sometime this morning.|||LMP|Gordy, also curious who's wa - who's watching Challenger this morning?|||CC|Well, let's see.|||LMP|Not much to see, I realize, but I'm sure somebody's there.||03 09 02 36|CC|We need OMNI Charlie, Jack.|||CC|Well, we've got the first team on - the gold team -your LOI and landing team, and the LM guys are Merritt and Thorson.|||LMP|You cut out on the telmu. Who is it?|||CC|Merlin. Merlin the Magician.|||LMP|I'm sorry, Gordy, you clipped off the first again.|||CC|Merlin Merritt, the magician.|||LMP|Oh, yes; of course. As I recall, he's the only one that really understands Thorson.|||CC|He says he doesn't think anybody understands Thorson.|||LMP|Well, we're sure looking forward to having a chance to make those guys work a little bit.||||||||Tape.55/15|||CC|They say - well - Merlin says he is, too. I don't know about Thorson. He's out of the room at the moment.|||LMP|He's probably spilling coffee in SPAN.|||CC|Roger.||03 09 06 31|CC|We need OMNI Delta now.||03 09 08 44|LMP|Gordy, for some reason, it's a lot easier to tell the difference between the Antarctic Continent and the icepack.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Maybe the glancing Sun is picking up the breaks in the icepack and giving it a different appearance.|||CC|Roger.||03 09 09 32|LMP|The continent itself - all you can see are very -what appear to be very gentle differences in - or subtle differences in shading, possibly indicating rolling relief due to a photometric dark beam along the - as a function of local phase angle.|||CC|Copy.|||LMP|And except, maybe, for the area just - well, no -even there, I didn't the ... - it looks like the whole visible continent is clear of clouds this morning. Possibly some clouds just east of the Ross Sea, which is just coming into view, I think.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I know we don't have many listeners in Antarctica, but it looks like they're having a - exceptionally fine day over the portion of the continent we can see.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 55/16||||03 09 11 20|LMP|That weak front I mentioned in the South Atlantic stretches from the apparent storm center around Goa Island -I'm not sure about that pronunciation either - up just to the coast of South America from Brazil, where it reaches its maximum eastward extent.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Our sub - our zero-phase point of the spacecraft is in the middle of the South Atlantic. And it's moderately bright, although there is no central bright point at all - a fairly large area, but moderately bright. The seas down there might be moderately choppy or rough this morning.|||CC|Okay.||03 09 l4 26|LMP|Houston, 17.|||CC|Go.|||LMP|"Okay, Gordy. You might say ""uh"" before you - you start your sentences because you're clipping your first word.

You say we are GO to jett the SIM bay down a little early, huh?|||CC|Well, stand by. I think we're backing down here. Stand by 1 second.|||CDR|Okay.||03 09 31 39|CMP|No. I checked it at one frame.|||CDR|Might check it.||03 09 31 46|CC|Okay, America. Once again, you're GO to jett the door, and you can do it early, if you wish.|||CDR|Okay, Gordo. We'll do it on - on Ron's mark down there.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|Hey, Houston. You know this attitude - this attitude has the Sun right into window 5- It's probably going to be on the lens of the camera. I'll - I'll try to shade it the best I can, but I don't have an awful lot of hope for these pictures.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|I think we're probably stuck with it, Jack, because we need to be in.this right attitude, for the clearance and -||||||||Tape 56/3|||CMP|Okay. SIM door jett 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -||03 09 32 51|CMP|JETT. Oh, I got a good bang. You see it, Jack?||03 09 33 00|LMP|Houston, there it goes, I got it out the hatch window and it looks like it was a clean Jett. It's rolling and pitching and yawing, slightly. There is a lot of garbage that came out with it.|||CMP|Can you take a picture, Gene?|||CDR|Let me see it.|||CMP|Ah - ah (laughter).|||CDR|You take a picture. Yes, there it goes.|||CDR|Hello, Houston. How do you read?|||CMP|It's really - -|||CC|Sounded good.|||CDR|Okay. Did you get the word we got a clean jett?|||CC|That's right, Geno. Sounds good.||03 09 33 56|CDR|Okay. The door's moving - the door's moving directly away from us, mostly rolling. And it looks like it was a very clean - clean separation.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|Yes. Boy, we got a good bang out of it. You could hear that - that pyro going, I think. It's rotating at about 5 - or 1 revolution per 5 seconds.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|And it's rotating - what, about the long axis? Yes. Rotating about the long axis.||03 09 34 58|CDR|Houston, the garbage that I said went with it was just a small amount of debris, I'm sure around the sea]ant pyro area. There was one, oh, about a 4-foot-length piece of, oh, 1 or 2 inch tapelike material that also went out with it.||||||Tape 56/4|||||CC|Roger, Gene.|||LMP|(Laughter) Okay. What do we do with these LOGIC POWER switches? Don't they go back to OFF now?||03 09 35 28|CMP|DOOR JETT's OFF, down.||03 09 35 32|CMP|Okay. You go on to the DEPLOY/RETRACT on number 1.||03 09 35 35|CMP|DEPLOY/RETRACT on number 2.||03 09 35 43|CDR|FUEL CELL REACT VALVES are NORMAL. I'm sort of glad we had those in LATCH.|||CMP|Yes, me, too, because that's a pretty good bang.||03 09 36 25|CC|You've loaded the wrong pitch angle there in NOUN 22.|||CDR|Well, I'm - I got 10 degrees loaded; that's what we've got copied down here in the change.|||CC|Maybe there's some mistake. Let us check here, Geno.|||CDR|Okay, we got 320, 010, and 324, and before I go into the muver - maneuver, I'll roll right about 12 degrees,|||CC|Bad call, Gene. Our error; you're right.|||CDR|Thank you, sir.|||CMP|Okay, and the UV SPECTROMETER is going to go ON here.||03 09 37 32|CMP|MARK it.|||CC|Roger. Mark the UV.|||LMP|Okay, and the IR will be OFF on your cue.|||CC|Okay, Jack, that'll be 12 or 15 minutes from now.||||||||Tape 56/5|||LMP|Okay, just give us a call.||03 09 39 4l|LMP|Okay, the 100-WATT O2 HEATER circuit breaker's coming OPEN.|||CC|Okay, Jack.||03 09 40 14|LMP|Okay, 02 HEATERS 1 and 2 going to AUTO, and 3, OFF.|||CC|Roger.||03 09 4l 51|CDR|Okay, Gordo. We'll wait until 50 past the hour and pick up the LM/CM DELTA-P; we're still reading 0.6.|||CC|Roger. That sounds good.||03 09 42 09|CDR|And we're in the process of maneuvering and I guess I'll start to see if I can't get you some biomeds.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|I don't know whether you were watching the LMP on the door jett, did you see a jett on my heartbeat?|||CC|Well, we'll check this data here, Jack.|||LMP|I guess I was remembering erroneously 15*s comment that it was very quiet, but I - of course, Ron reminded me they were in the suits.|||CC|Okay, Jack. John Young was talking about the same thing here, but we didn't see anything on your EKG.|||LMP|How stable could you get?||03 09 43 29|CMP|And Houston, 17 here. Mag Bravo Bravo is indicating 20 - let's see - indicating 76 percent now -76-percent full.|||CC|Okay, Ron.|||CDR|And, Gordo, we are watching the 8-ball.||||||Tape 56/6|||||CC|Roger. We're keeping an eye on it, too.||03 09 53 05|CC|America, we'd like the HIGH GAIN to AUTO, please.||03 09 53 15|LMP|Okay, you've got it to AUTO. I think we may have a new discovery about microphones up here.|||CC|Oh, is that right? What's that?|||LMP|Well, Gordy, it looks as if you could improve your voice quality by putting fingers over the end of the mike booms. At least that works on the intercom.|||CC|How about that.|||CC|America, Houston. We're ready for the IR to OFF.|||LMP|Okay. IR's coming OFF -||03 09 55 31|LMP|MARK it.||03 09 57 l6|LMP|Hey, Gordy. Who's operating in the trench in front of you today?|||CC|Okay. It's the LOI and descent team, Presley, Green, and Deiterich.|||LMP|They're a trio of musketeers, if I ever heard of one.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|All they lack is a French accent.|||CC|A New York accent is about the best they can do.|||LMP|I wasn't going to exercise any value judgments, Gordy.||03 10 00 57|CC|Jack, this is Houston.

We've been reading you. I think you're on VHF, however. Would you like us to reacquire on the high gain?|||CC|Stand by. I'll check on that.|||CC|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to try the HIGH GAIN at a PITCH of minus 29, YAW 17, MANUAL and WIDE.||03 11 34 27|LMP|Okay, Gordy, we're on the HIGH GAIN.|||CC|Okay, Jack.|||LMP|How do you read?|||CC|I'm reading you - I can read you, but there's still a lot of background noise.|||LMP|Like VHF would sound, but I'm not sure I believe it.||03 11 35 29|CC|Jack, we just commanded NORMAL voice.||||||Tape 57/2|||||LMP|Gordy, did we end up somehow out of NORMAL voice?|||CC|Jack, we'd like you to try a NORMAL acquisition. Go AUTO and NARROW on the HIGH GAIN.||03 11 35 5if|LMP|Okay, that peaked it up, AUTO and NARROW.|||CC|Okay, you're loud and clear now.|||LMP|Okay, Gordy. You said that you had to command NORMAL voice. Did we get a spurious command in there some way?|||CC|Okay, we had - we did all that ourselves to establish voice through Ascension; no problem. Over.|||LMP|Okay, Gordy. How did you reach us when you finally started calling?|||CC|Stand by.|||CC|Jack, we didn't do anything to cause the problem there, we were up-linking through Madrid and downlinking through Ascension. Did you see anything on board that could have caused the loss of lock?|||LMP|No, sir. We had good signal strength. It wasn't peaked for the high gain. It was more like an omni signal strength, about 70 percent. And we called you several times after the switch in lines, and then finally you came through clear, but with some background noise and sounded like VHF. I presume it wasn't, now. And when you called, I went to OMNI Alfa, with no change in signal strength, still about 70 percent, and you were still coming up the same way and apparently didn't hear us. And then the high gain - with high gain acquisition, it's been pretty clear.|||CC|Okay, that's the way - that story's the way it sounded to us. And we're looking around here to see if we can figure out a reason for loss there.||03 11 38 31|LMP|Okay, and I'm ready to pressurize the SPS, if that's what you want.||||||||Tape 57/3|||CC|Okay, let me make sure here.|||CC|Okay, Jack. We're ready for it.|||LMP|Okay, you want me to just use SPS HELIUM VALVE 1?|||CC|That' s affirmative,||03 11 39 35|LMP|Okay, Gordy. We're going to ON with SPS HELIUM VALVE 1. We checked the circuit breakers, they're IN.|||CC|Okay.||03 11 39 46|LMP|Okay, pressure's com - pressure's up; FUEL PRESSURE is stable at 175 and OXIDIZER at 175, and the light is out. And we're back to NORMAL on CAUTION AND WARNING. And the VALVE now is back to AUTO.|||CC|Roger. And looks - looks good here. We're reading 184 oxidizer and 185 fuel.||03 11 40 47|LMP|Hey, Gordy, this is the LMP. I got a question for you.|||CC|Shoot.|||LMP|I'm just wondering if - I'm showing about 85 amps, and is that a good normal power load with - I presume the 0g HEATERs are ON now.|||CC|Just a second, we'll check that.|||LMP|I'm just trying to reestablish my references here for LOI.|||CC|EECOM says the HEATERs are ON and that's the normal load.||03 11 4l 33|LMP|Okay.

We can go to wide dead band, if you want, if you'll remind me to go back to narrow again when we need to.|||CC|Let me check on that.|||CMP|Might save a teacupful of fuel.|||CC|Ron, we suggest just staying where you are on the dead band; there's no problem on fuel.||03 11 44 53|CMP|Okay. Mighty fine, Gordo. Thank you.||03 11 47 4l|CC|America, Hou - Houston. We just finished a site handover. And we're seeing some excessive counts on the UV.

After your handover, we heard your statement that you handed over and then hadn't been able to contact you after that. I just hit a COMMAND RESET.|||CC|Okay, Jack, that was a problem here on the ground.

Right?||||||||Tape 57/5||03 11 55 40|CC|That1s affirmative.||03 11 56 07|CMP|Houston, 17*|||CC|Go ahead.|||CMP|Gordo, just an interesting observation on my part. I don't know why, but all the air bubbles in the beverage packs - you know, none of the air bubbles will come together at all. If you get it a small air bubble, it stays in a small air bubble. And they'll never co - come together. However, in my chicken and rice soup package here, I had a whole bunch of small air bubbles and now it's all one great big air bubble in the middle.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|Most of the - most of the spoon bowl packs you know - or wet packs, whereas the juice bags won't do it.|||CC|Okay, that's interesting. I sure don't know why either.|||LMP|We're just trying to keep your day interesting here, Gordy. Now that you won't let us look at the Earth anymore, we'll start looking in the cabin.|||CC|Okay, while you're looking in the cabin, I've got a new hydrogen cryo configuration for you to minimize the pressure cycling and cut down the wear and tear on the motor switch. If you're ready to do it, I'll read it.||03 11 57 52|LMP|Go ahead.|||CC|Okay, on Hg TANK 1 and TANK 2 HEATERS, both of them, OFF. On the FANs, TANK 1 FAN's ON, TANK 2 FAN's OFF. I think they're there already. And TANK 3 FAN's AUTO. Over.|||LMP|Hey, there's a new configuration. Okay, H2 HEATERs 1 and 2 are OFF.

Window -the - the north has got to be on the right as I look at the limb of the Moon opposite the Sun. Because when we go into retrograde attitude, it's got to be over there.

I'm with you, and I'm getting lots of advice here.|||CDR|"Okay. Okay. I'll bet you are. But I - I think I got it oriented. You can literally watch yourself fall down in. As we get closer, if we're going to have a view like this, it's going to be pretty dramatic. Because we're calling the way you climb on out of the Moon when you leave it, if you can see. And I remember remarks at that time, ""Gee, if we could see it like this when we came back in, we'd have to close our eyes."" If we can see this thing coining in like I think we may be able to see it at 50 miles, it isn't going to look like very much."||||||Tape 58/2|||||CC|Roger. We agree.|||CDR|And we're even considering the win - putting -Gordy, we're consider - Gordy, we're considering putting the window covers up.|||CC|You're chickens, huh?||03 12 32 21|CDR|It's going to be one of those high - high - angle energy conversion roundouts.|||CC|Roger. From our information here, if you're looking at the Moon so that the - the dark limb is up, then north should be to the right.|||CDR|Yes. I - I concur, and that's the way it is.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|The horizon is just steadily growing bigger.|||CC|Does it look about the same as last time?|||CDR|"What do you mean, ""last time?"" Couple years ago?"|||CC|Right.|||CDR|Gordy, we never saw it coming in a couple years ago. We saw it, as I recall, a day out, and we saw just a - a shadow of the limb. But we - to my best re - recollection, we never saw it this close. As a matter of fact, we went into darkness prior to going into LOI, and this time, much to my amazement, we don't. But I see now that we won't, and I see why. I'll tell you, everyone who's seen that view leaving knows how fast you climb out. And by golly, the closer we get to it, the faster we're coming in.||03 12 33 56|CC|Roger.||03 12 39 28|CDR|Gordo. The - the widest-most part of the convex horizon probably covers a good couple of degrees. I can now see relief on the - on the horizon itself against the dark space.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 58/3|||CDR|And the rim of Korolev is readily visible standing out by itself in the - in the darker or the unlit part of the - of the Moon. I can see the central peaks or mountains very well lit up.||03 12 40 50|LMP|Okay, Gordy. This is Jack. Is there any reason not to start the checks at about 87:43?|||CC|Stand by.|||CDR|Okay, Gordy. What I - what I called a - a central peak or range in there must undoubtedly be that inner ring, but it - the way it was lit up in the sunlight gave you a definite impression that it had an enlongated central range.||03 12 4l 46|CC|Roger. And for Jack, no problem starting early on the checks.||03 12 4l 56|LMP|Okay. They're in work.||03 12 43 36|CDR|Okay, Hous -|||LMP|..., Houston. Going to put the UV COVER OPEN. How long?|||CC|Okay, Jack. And we'd like 5 minutes of operation with it OPEN.|||LMP|Okay.||03 12 43 57|LMP|MARK it, OPEN.||03 12 45 40|LMP|Okay, Houston; 17. I've started the secondary glycol pump, and it - I neglected to make a check on the evap OP temperature. Do you have that, and did we get a decrease?|||CC|Stand by. Looks okay, Jack.|||LMP|Thank you.||03 12 48 13|LMP|Okay, Gordo. There's NOUN 05.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 58/4|||||LMP|And you're looking at the torquing angle.||03 12 48 58|LMP|Okay, Houston.

UV COVER is CLOSED.||03 12 49 55|LMP|Okay, Houston. Going back to SPS PRESSURE INDICATOR 1.||03 12 50 02|CC|Okay.||03 12 52 31|CC|America, Houston. We - we still see the UV door open. Have you closed it yet?||03 12 52 51|LMP|Okay. It's now CLOSED, Gordy.|||CC|Roger.||03 12 53 31|CC|America, Houston.

Fifty miles above target, I'd like to add.|||CC|Okay. That sounds good.|||CDR|The limb is, of course, still growing and a little more rapidly. And what I can see of the - of the limb that's not blocked out by the Sun, it's getting obviously much larger in the window.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 58/6|||||CDR|Now I guess it depends on the shadowing of the Sun as to whether or not we're going to see too much. I think retrograde, we ought to see quite a bit once we get over the terminator.|||CDR|Gordy, there's enough of the lighted portion of the Moon where you can see the relief - not just a shadowing relief, but the actual relief of several craters as they stretch across the terminator, both to the north and to the south. I can see even more definite relief now on the horizon, just to the north and behind Korolev - on the black horizon against space.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|The - the unlit part of the Moon, as you might expect, is just as dark from here as is deep space itself.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|It's black, I might say at this point.||03 13 03 58|CC|America, Houston. For your information, your altitude is about 3000 miles now.|||CDR|Okay, 3000 miles.|||CDR|Gordy, the - the limb has much more three-dimensional relief now. Towards us, you can - you can get the feeling that the horizon - the litted portion of the horizon definitely does flow in our direction. And although you can't see the unlit portion of the Moon, you get a feeling that there's a great deal more of it a lot closer than that which you can see.|||CC|Roger.||03 13 05 52|CDR|Okay, Gordy. The pre-SPS burn aim prep is complete.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 58/7|||CDR|And I'm going to give my buddies a chance to look at it now.|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|I never thought I'd see a geologist speechless at his first near - near shot at the Moon, but I haven't heard a word from him yet.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|This geologist turned engineer for about an hour.|||CC|He's probably speechless, because there's no clouds to talk about.||03 13 08 08|CDR|Gordo, everything's looking good on board. We're just waiting for about 88:05. We'll be in our maneuver at that time.|||CC|Okay. Everything looks good here also.|||CDR|Okay. And is your LOS of about 45 still good?|||CC|I'll doublecheck that.||03 13 10 14|CC|America, the Plight Plan is correct on LOS. To be exact, it will be 88:43:40.|||CDR|43:40. Thank you, Gordo.|||CDR|If - if you guys could get an idea down there of the needle you're threading when you shoot for 50 miles at a quarter of million, you'd be mighty proud of yourselves, I'll tell you, we are.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR.|I guess I really ought to wait and tell you that at 89:16:29.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Hey, Gordy. Do you have any idea what our relative speed is to the - to the Moon at this time?||||||Tape 58/8|||||CC|Yes. It's 5000 feet per second. You're presently 2660 miles up.|||CDR|Okay. I assume T, P. is there, and I guess John is, too. I don't know if John saw this coming in on 16, but I know they can recall what we saw leaving on 10. And other than the fact that you can't see as much of the Moon, it's Just as impressive.|||CC|Roger. I was just talking to John about it a couple of minutes ago. Their view on 16 was -they didn't have any sunlit Moon, but they did have some pretty good earthshine.||03 13 13 59|CDR|Well, he - he knows what I'm talking about then.||03 13 16 59|CDR|Gordy, it's an unbelievable view through the monocular now. You can really see down in the depths of some of the larger craters and with a great deal of clarity. And you can see the - some of the higher ridges actually rolling right over the horizon as they go away from you.|||CC|Roger, Geno.||03 13 25 32|CDR|Hey, Houston. As much as I hate to, I think we're going to have to maneuver out of this attitude.|||CC|Roger. As you take your last look there, you're presently 20 - just a little over 2000 miles up, and you're coming down about 4500 feet per second.||03 13 25 59|CDR|Yes. You'd better believe that.||03 13 29 33|CDR|Gordo, there's only one better view than this.|||CC|What's that, Gene?|||CDR|Right at the moment anyway. Right at the moment anyway, is to be out there and watching this spacecraft maneuver in attitude and - and watch it burn over the lunar surface. I get the feeling someone is watching.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 58/9||03 13 31 07|CC|Give us OMNI Charlie, please.||03 13 33 25|CC|Apollo 17, Houston. We just had a site handover.

It's the only thing I noticed that was offnominal. It -it bounced ground a lot, in bouncing arou - it was initially for about a minute - around - oh, 1.8 decrease, then it gradually started to diverge from that to a more decrease, down to about 2.5 or make that 3 decrease. And I went to DECREASE on the switch; and about the time of crossover, I had it at - oh, about 1 decrease and it crossed over and stabilized at zero, and I went to NORMAL and it stayed there the rest of the bum - until just near the end, it started to go decrease again.|||CC|Okay, we copy that, Jack.|||LMP|Okay, Gordo, did you by any chance get the S-IVB impact?|||CC|We're - Okay, the new impact time for that is 89:39, so we haven't quite got there yet.|||CDR|Okay.

Five seconds later, I put on band B, the chamber pressure rose to 90 - about 91 -somewhere in that area. And then, throughout the bum, chamber pressure increased, which you'll see on the strip chart. But I was sure surprised at only 87 percent when we started it. It looked like the velocity gained versus time was correct throughout the burn, though. The maximum the chamber pressure ever got to was about 97 percent, and that was toward the end of the bum.|||CC|Roger, Ron.||||||Tape 59/4||||03 14 46 10|CDR|A little disappointed here, Gordo.

There is no obvious ray pattern or secondary pattern outside of that blanket around Picard.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|I see no loops or obvious alignment that would be related to that crater. There are blocks - look like great big blocky areas on the rim.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Do they want the 80-millimeter lens on these terminators now?|||LMP|There's Taruntius, Ron.|||LMP|Yes, I guess that's right.|||LMP|I've got to get another magazine on it.||03 14 55 12|CC|Roger. Can you verify the position of the P - PU valve at this time for us?||03 14 55 19|CDR|Roger. It's in NORMAL.|||CC|Okay.||03 14 55 45|LMP|Macrobius, Macrobius, my friend.|||CDR|No, it's Microbus [sic].|||LMP|Okay, I'm loaded up for your terminator, Ron. What's - is it not out of 105, or what? Is it -Okay, 80-millimeter or -|||CMP|80.|||LMP|80 - -|||CMP|... Millimeter ... f/ll at 1/500 ...|||LMP|Okay.|||CMP|8o-millimeter.|||LMP|Okay.||||||||Tape 59/7|||CMP|f/11 at 1/500.|||LMP|Five frames over the terminator, huh?|||CMP|12 frames.|||LMP|12 frames. Very good. How soon do I start?|||CMP|Well, about -|||LMP|Okay.|||CMP|||03 14 56 37|LMP|Okay, in about 5 minutes. All right. Gordy, you'd be interested - there's a - crater that just on the - on the west rim of Crisium. Relatively fresh rim - fairly crisp rim, but no strong ray pattern. There's no ray pattern apparent at all. It looks like it's pre - the plains material around it - that - since they come right up over the -right up to the edge of the crater in one spot. That is Posidonius. That's right. That's what I'm looking at.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Not Posidonius, Proclus. That's what I'm describing. You know I - You're looking where?|||CDR|... 4l.|||LMP|Infamous Proclus. Okay, give me a mark when I'm -Hey, look at the - -|||CDR|Okay, I'll give you a mark, Jack.|||LMP|At the Cauchy Rilles here. Man, is that neat. Let me see. Going to have to -|||CDR|One right there with the shadowed peak in there. Right? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And that's out of this window, huh? I'm not - sure I'm seeing it yet.|||LMP|Manischewitz! Look at those terminators.|||CDR|Shadows.||||||Tape 59/8|||||LMP|There's the mare domes for the central craters. They're certainly obvious. In - northern part of -Let's see -|||CDR|The lineations that trend to the northwest through this entire - entire section - they go through the -mostly through the highlands.|||LMP|I can get the pictures. Is it directly out of window 5? Okay. We've got about another minute and a half. I'm going to proceed here at 4l.|||CMP|It'll be right underneath the groundtrack. It's right under it.||03 l4 59 36|LMP|Well, that's the way we're going. I'm taking them east-west.|||CMP|Okay. I ...|||LMP|0 - yes. Okay.|||CDR|Hey, Jack, we're at - coming up on 40.||03 15 00 07|CC|... about a minute to PRO on P20.|||CDR|Yes. We're at 40 - Okay, I'm with you, Gordo. Thank you.|||CMP|Okay, you got it.|||LMP|Okay.|||CDR|Don't forget to PRO, Ron; you've got - you got 8 seconds.||03 15 01 02|CDR|MARK it - 4l. Okay, I guess you can - -|||LMP|Goes. With the usual FA0 flight planning, that was a good time.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Hey, you can even see horizon in the - earthshine out there.|||CDR|Boy, you sure can. You can see an earthlit horizon out there into the dark part of the Moon.||||||||Tape 59/9|||LMP|Can you see the landing site? I think it's going to be in the darkness.|||CDR|No, I - it - The shadows are so contrasting here, Ron, that I -|||CMP|Give me that thing a minute.||03 15 02 00|LMP|Donius [sic]. There's le Monnier, the landing site. I can't -|||CDR|No, it's just - it's just dark.|||LMP|Isn't it a little north of track?|||CDR|No, I think it's right below us, Jack. I think it's right smack below us in darkness.|||LMP|Yes, I yes, it is. I can't - I think I'm looking at Littrow right there, right below us. But I can't quite tell.|||CDR|If I could see Vitruvius, I'd have a better handle on it.|||CC|A reminder to go to f/4 and 1/250 on the last six pictures.|||CDR|Roger. That's Posidonius all right, le Monnier; we're here early.|||LMP|Boy, I tell you, there's no question that right at the terminator you - you pick up relief that you normally would not believe is there in the mare. I remember Bill Anders talking about the appearance of a sea swell within the mare itself and that's certainly clearly shown right at the terminator. Unless you start to see the shadows from all the very small craters that otherwise don't show up as much more that just little depressions, if that.|||CC|Okay. We need ACCEPT so we can give you a landing site REFSMMAT.||||||Tape 59/10||||03 15 03 45|CMP|Okay, you have it.|||LMP|Yes. Okay, I think that will do her. Okay, Houston. I cheated. I took three extra pictures, and those were at 2.8 and a 250th at the end.|||CC|Okay, Jack.|||LMP|And, your - actually your times might have been a little off, because I was just about ready to lose the terminator because of the maneuver - are we maneuvering or have we?|||CMP|Yes.|||LMP|But, I think we got a good set going up to the terminator.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|Plus a couple of shots - a few shots on the CEX mag Quebec Que - No, mag Kilo Kilo as we came around the Moon and that number's now on 20. Kilo Kilo is 20, and Quebec Quebec is 42.|||CC|Okay, we need the IR, ON, now.|||LMP|Okay, back to work.|||CC|It's your computer; the up-link's in there, and you can go back to BLOCK.|||LMP|IR going ON -||03 15 05 33|LMP|MARK it.|||LMP|Yes, enough - enough tourist activity.|||LMP|Warm in here, isn't it?|||CC|America, a couple of items. Would you verify the S-BAND AUX TV switch is in the SCIENCE position? And one other thing, we think you were in LOW BIT RATE during the bum.||03 15 06 34|LMP|Okay, it's in SCIENCE and we very definitely were in HIGH BIT RATE during the bum by the checklist.||||||||Tape 59/11|||CC|Roger. We may have a problem there because it looks like LOW to us on the data. We'll check further.|||LMP|Hey, Gordy, there was - Ron questioned - brought up the question or possibility of not having gone to COMMAND RESET; but, just before we left you, you'll probably be able to see that I went COMMAND RESET and turned on the tape, because I remember seeing the tape motion.|||CC|Okay, Jack. We're discussing it - what happened there.||03 15 08 35|CC|America, you can go back to BLOCK.||03 15 11 52|LMP|Okay, Houston. How do you read 17?|||CC|You're loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|Okay. Before we really got concentrating on the bum, and I had an opportunity to - we all had an opportunity to look at Korolev, at a very low grazing Sun, one of the striking things was the -to me was the extreme absence of relief, the very smooth surface that existed in Korolev, independent, of course, of the craters that are penetrating that surface. And it looked like there was a ring in the floor - outsi - next to the wall about maybe one-sixth of a crater radius that was somewhat brighter at the low grazing Sun, suggesting it may have had a different slope. And I believe I'm correct in saying that the inner floor may be slightly raised. We'll try to make other observations this next time around on that one, but there was just a very smooth floor. The light plains material in that crater is very smooth.|||CC|Okay; understand. One quick word from FAO's - -|||LMP|And, of course, that's independent - -||||||Tape 59/12|||||CC|- - film watchers here, has to do with optional photographs. We'd rather you take the optional photographs on either 00 or PP and reserve KK for the scheduled photographs. And, as it stands now, we've got to reserve 80 frames on either 00 or PP for scheduled photography. Over.||03 15 13 42|LMP|Okay, you have to keep track of that. We need -I was hoping we had an optional capability on our first rev, and we'll work it out.|||CC|We do. We just want to put them on 00.|||CC|That's right; just stick them on 00.|||CC|Jack, the problem on the high and low bit rate there was a synchronization problem between you on the burn checklist and us on the ground on our pre-IX)S command. No hardware problems, and I don't think it will be a problem in the future.|||LMP|Okay. But you did lose the high bit rate. Is that correct?|||CC|That's affirmative. We just had low bit rate during the bum.||03 15 15 19|LMP|Okay. I may have jumped the gun on you there a little bit. But I thought we were supposed to do that just before we went AOS - LOS. I think I did it about a minute before.|||CC|Okay. It was almost identi - simultaneous with our sending the command. You've got about 4 minutes to start looking at Copernicus coining here.|||LMP|Okay. Thank you. We're just - Sun's Just setting.||03 15 16 08|LMP|Okay, I have a visual on Copernicus.||03 15 17 06|CC|And by the way, the S-IVB crunched in on time, and it's been ringing the ALSEP seismometers like mad for some time now.||||||||Tape 59/13||03 15 17 42|LMP|VOX, and that's VOX. How do you read the LMP, Gordy?|||CC|Loud and clear, Jack.|||LMP|Thank you. Okay, good. All right, I've got a visual on Eratosthenes and Copernicus. The - there are obviously different-age craters in this ligjht. You can see the ray patterns in Copernicus moderately well. You can even tell that they do cross Eratosthenes. Stadius shows up as a very clear dark area to the southwest of Eratosthenes. Now, one of the things that we mapped on the southeast and south rim of Copernicus were dark albedo areas within the ejecta. And those are apparent here, very clearly. And also, within -on the upper portion of the rim and on the benches, in that quadrant. The walls - there are the dark spots - lower albedo material that we mapped. They are - form linear patterns along the benches, apparently. Although the bench - the topography is not too clear. But the dark spots are in arcuate linear arrangement parallel to the rim. And they appear to have - be elongate along radius - along the radius of the crater.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|This is in the southeast - southeast quadrant I'm referring to. Copernicus H is also very obvious as a dark-rimmed crater, relative to the albedo of the ejecta blanket. And the northwest quadrant, which we mapped as a smooth floor material and somewhat darker albedo, is just as apparent here, although all the contrasts, of course, are less. The main thing that you can pick out in earthshine are albedo distinctions. Now - now we - we - I remember that we also, at one time - and I can't remember whether it made the final map or not -mapped an arcuate fault structure, based on the change in albedo. And this was on the southwest quadrant of Copernicus. And that crossed the southern rim, more or less north-south, went down and curved across the floor and up the southwest rim, and that is a very clear arcuate pattern in this lighting. Darker albedo than the rest of the||||||Tape 59/l4||||||crater. And along the arc, there appear to be a couple or three even darker spots - much as we thought we saw in some of the early photography.|||CC|Roger.||03 15 21 24|LMP|There is a general streaking - radial streaking -within that arcuate dark area that radiates radially from the crater, and if I had to project, the dark area would, - north - whose northeast terminus is the arc in the crater, I'd project it off to southeast about crater diameter and a half, maybe. Now there's - I'm getting - essentially directly overhead, and again the dark spots within the crater wall are still apparent, and the streaming or the radial elongation of these spots is clear. Now, on the lower wall - that's below the first bench - I can see four of these dark areas, and on the next wall above that, above the first bench, there are two - two obvious ones and a couple that are somewhat more subtle.|||CC|Okay - -|||LMP|In the middle of the - -|||CC|- - Can you see anything of the - that stuff we were wondering about in the central peaks?|||LMP|No, Gordy, I can't. The - there's very little indication of relief in earthshine end particularly at this high Sun ang - high Earth angle, pardon the expression.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|The central peaks do stand out, though, as a much lighter albedo area within the crater. It looks to me like the best thing you can do in earthshine is work with albedos. Knowing the general topography from the - from the pre - earlier photography. We're coining up on Kepler now. Copernicus is out of my view in window 5- Maybe Ron sees it. Do you, Ron?||||||||Tape 59/15|||CMP|No, it's out of ny view now, too.|||LMP|Okay, we, we - -|||CDR|Can you see Reinhold over there?|||LMP|Reinhold, I was not conscious of. Yes, I can see Reinhold. Reinhold is one of the craters just like Copernicus that may have contributed ejecta into the Apollo 12 soil. Do you see anything - -|||CMP|An S - an S-IVB - l6's S-IVB hit out there to the south, I think.|||LMP|Well, I don't -|||CMP|No, I don't think you1d see it.|||LMP|I don't see anything that would indicate that. Reinhold is an Erat os theni an Age crater, as you may recall. It's crossed, very obviously even in this light, by the Copernican rays, which is prime - the main way we determine the age, other than it doesn't have any rays itself. Although, on the good photography we now have, we know it has secondary crater patterns around it.|||CDR|You're not looking at the same crater I am then.|||LMP|Reinhold is right down here, Geno.|||CDR|Where are you looking ...|||LMP|Well, it's south of Copernicus.|||CDR|Okay, I'm looking up here.||03 15 24 53|LMP|South and a little west.|||CDR|I don't have the same view you have.|||LMP|Okay, I can see Lansberg now. And I'm afraid I can't shed any light, pardon the expression, on the old question we've had about the age of Lansberg relative to the mare.||||||Tape 59/16||||03 15 25 17|CC|Okay.|||LMP|Kepler ray pattern is very striking in this light -an anastomoting - mosing series of - of bands which only average being radial. In most cases, they're a little off radial, but by joining together, they give you a general radial pattern.|||CDR|I just wanted to see a -||03 15 25 51|LMP|Okay. Out the window 4, I have an excellent view of Kepler. Once again, albedo differences, such as the - are very clear - such as the distinction between the wall - light - or brighter wall materials and the rim which, in itself, is brighter than the surrounding mare. We can look right down some of the rays, and the rays are not completely linear. I'm looking now to the northwest. Gene, you can see Aristarchus way up there in the northwest. See it?|||CDR|Yes. It1s coming into ...|||LMP|You ought to have a good view of Aristarchus. Very bright, up in the northwest part of our field of view.|||CDR|The inside of that crater almost looks as if it's backlit.|||LMP|That's right. Well, it should be (chuckle). Strangely enough.|||LMP|And - but I want - these rays when contrast to the - maybe the feeling one would have that they are - once they get started, they form a linear pattern across the surface. They don't seem to have done that. As a matter of fact, they're quite strikingly curved along their pattern. They'll break from the general radius they're out on, curve away and then curve back. Some - all -let's see, there are one - one, two, three, four -four rays that go from out to the northwest of Kepler, all of which show that nonlinear characteristic.||||||||Tape 59/17|||CDR|Yes, they're all radial, though-|||LMP|They are radial, in general. But when you look at them in detail, only portions of them are radial. And a single ray, which you can follow continuously, will bend and then curve back.|||CMP|The - it's unique. We've got rays from - I guess those must be Copernicus over here - those long ones out to the right, which you might not be able to see. Kepler and Reiner are all - all intermingling up here.|||LMP|Yes, this is the area now we're going over where the gamma ray work on 15 indicated a relatively high radioactivity. And - not yet, it's -|||CMP|Houston, America here. Do you see the torquing angles?|||LMP|I was going to look for the Hortensius domes near Copernicus, but got sidetracked with Kepler and missed them.||03 15 28 37|CC|Okay, ... torquing angles, Ron,|||LMP|They are not obvious, though, in looking in the general direction -|||CMP|Okay, I'll torque it to 845.|||CC|Roger.||03 15 28 58|LMP|Okay, we're getting out into Procellarum - Oceanus Procell arum proper now and, before long, should pick up the medial ridge that makes that mare so distinctive from the other mare. Actually, the ridge that stretches something like 2000 kilometers north to south, if you want to tie a vari - a number of things together. And, probably is the lun - the Moon's closest analogy to an oceanic ridge, which has - which have been in the news over the last decade.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 59/18||||03 15 29 49|LMP|Once again, the topography of the Procellarum Mare is not clear in this light. It's just not quite enough light to give you strong, distinct shadows, at least not yet at this Earth angle.|||CC|Okay. And as you get the camera set up for the orbital science pictures of Galois would want to change and use magazine 00 instead of KK. That's listed in the Flight Plan at 90:20.|||LMP|Okay, we'll - we'll do that.||03 15 30 32|LMP|Okay I'm - out of the window 4, I'm able to see some of the Rima Gamma materials, and it's - awful hard to say more than just the fact there is a very clear light-colored pattern off to the north -of our position at any rate. I think all I can say is that I've seen it. I can't give you much information on it.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|We can see the area where Marius Hills should be, although it's not an obvious topographic feature in this light. Still see Aristarchus off up there shining like a star, if the Moon could have stars.||03 15 31 40|CMP|Okay, Houston. I'm going to torque those cos -coarse align errors out at 1, 2.|||CC|Roger, Ron.|||LMP|And - -|||CDR|You squared away?|||CMP|It's good to be able to see some stars out of the telescope. It's the first time I've been able to see any.|||LMP|Gordy, we have a - a very clear zero phase point for the earthlight. It's certainly not a strong contrast for the Sun, but it's out there. And within it, again, the fresh craters tend to brighten - quite a bit more than the surrounding||||||||Tape 59/19||||mare. Still looking at Oceanus Procellarum. And now, out window 3, up to the northwest, Grimaldi is starting to show up - a very obvious dark area within the highlands of that part of the Moon -and one of the darkest mare regions that we have seen on the - on the Moon. It's comparable, at least in the photographs, to that of Tsiolkovsky.|||CC|Roger.||03 15 33 25|LMP|Normally, of course, we think of the dark mare as being the younger basalt flows that - on the Moon, but in our case, of course, young means something on the order of 3 billion years or older.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 60/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||03 15 33 44|CC|Roger.|||LMP|For our interp - If we can extrapolate from the samples returned by other missions.|||LMP|Amazing how far over - now the highlands to the west of Procellarum are - still are bright, and the contrast between fresh craters and the normal highland are very - are very obvious still in earthlight, particularly along the zero phase point with respect to the Earth. Rima Gamma now is - is coming a little bit closer to our oval track in the horseshoe in the - larger and more western end of it; the dark horseshoe is quite clear in this light. It's a west - or northwest-pointing horseshoe, as is the complete trend of that strange feature. I think Ron is going to have an excellent chance to study these light-colored swirls within the mare and other parts of the Moon. We had some good views of them and Mare Marginis and to the east of Crisium - Mare Crisium, and he should - if there is anything to be seen, he should be able to see it for - during the next few days.|||CC|Okeydoke.||03 15 35 50|CDR|Say, Gordo, something I Just noticed here in working with the GDC what-have-you. I - looked at the Pc gage, and in the Pz - Pc position, there is a continuous bias on it now of about, oh, 7 percent, and if I switch to ALPHA, it goes to zero. We never saw that bias before this last burn.|||CC|Roger, Gene.||03 15 36 35|LMP|Hey, Gordy, I'm looking right up the western edge of the Procellarum mare where it contacts the -the - the high - western highlands of the Moon, and we're just about to fly a little bit south of Grimaldi. That edge is very irregular. There is no obvious indications that it - there are large basins that have been flooded by mare that have formed that edge, but, again, the topographic dis-* tinction's possible in this lighter small. Now I'm starting to see that there are shadows in the craters.||||||Tape 60/2|||||CC|Roger.|||LMP|That's the small craters. There, in the Mare Procellarum closest to Grimaldi, there are two arcuate rilles. Look like they are probably V-shaped in their cross section. I'm sure we've seen those on the photographs much better than I can see them here. Those - the rille patterns, though, do seem to project over into the highlands.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|To the north of that - to the north of that bay of mare. Just interrupt.||03 15 38 09|LMP|Hey, I just saw a flash on the lunar surface!|||CC|Oh, yes?|||LMP|It was just out there north of Grimaldi. Just north of Grimaldi. You might see if you got anything on your seismometers, although a small impact probably would give a fair amount of visible light.|||CC|Okay. We'll check.|||LMP|It was a bright little flash right out there near that crater. See the crater right at the edge of Grimaldi. Then there is smother one north of it. Fairly sharp one north of it is where there was just a thin streak of light.|||CC|How about putting an X on the map where you saw it.|||LMP|I keep looking occasionally for - yes, we will. I - I was planning on looking for those kind of things. Starting to see the edge of Orientale, Gordy. Way off to the west. Hey, just yell, Gene, anytime you - -||03 15 39 46|LMP|Gordy, to the north of Grimaldi there is a large basin that is about the same size but only incompletely filled with mare in its northeastern quadrant. The rest of it looks like a fairly irregular and hummocky floor material of some kind.|||CC|Roger.||||||||Tape 60/3|||LMP|But it's almost the same size as Grimaldi. It even looks like it is a little bit deeper, but, of course, Grimaldi has considerable fill. Grimaldi on its eastern edge has some of the graben, or it's rim, if you will, is cut by three or four anastomosing grabens that make it look like some of the bench areas in the larger basins.||03 15 4l 00|LMP|Okay, the first ring of Orientale is showing up. The inner - next ring in is extremely obvious; got some very bright east - east-facing slopes.|||CDR|I'll turn off the intercom.|||LMP|It has some very bright east-facing slopes, and you can see the bands of mare that are filling the -both the first bench area and the inner bench.|||LMP|Any time you need us, Gordy, just interrupt me.|||CC|Okay; we'll do that.|||LMP|Now, as I look north along the first bench, that's the first bench from the outside, one inside the Cordillerian ring. I better check that; I may have my names mixed up. Got Orientale, there - handy? See it. Should be on there. Yes, this is what I need. What's the name - they got a name on that ridge, there? That's Rook Mountains. Yes, the Cordillera. Yes, that's right. Looking just west of the Cordillera on the first bench, as I look north, in this light, which is casting some shadows now, Gordy, over in the area, it looks extremely smooth. Now this is not mare; it's lighter albedo, lighter reflectivity than the mare, and, although there are patches of mare in the lower areas in it. But looking along that plain, in fact, a lar - long linear plain, it - it looks quite smooth with only some very broad undulations that appear to be roughly radial to Orientale itself. The more -closer we get to it, the more I see minor relief showing up. I start to see the shadows, I guess. And that relief seems to bring out a hummocky texture in - in addition to the craters you would expect to see there.|||CC|Roger.||||||Tape 60/4|||||LMP|I won't try to give you a trend on the hummocks because I think the shadows are biasing my view; they do appear to be north-south trending, but I think that is because of the shadow patterns. This is a spectacular sight, you guys; you ought to take a look at Orientale. One of the largest fresh basins on the Moon. It still is probably 4 billion years old, or 3.8 at any rate, if our dating criteria are any - any good. It has the outer Cordillerian ring and the inner ring called the Rook Mountains - very, very nicely shown. There are massifs on that inner ring, the Rook Mountain ring; there are massif complexes much like what we'll be studying at Taurus-Littrow. There are low areas, nonmare areas, that are comparable to some - to the Taurus - the valley that we'll be landing in. And, all in all, I think we'll find that our ring in the Taurus-Li11row area around Serenitatis is comparable in many regards to this Rook Mountain ring around Orientale. You want - did you interrupt, Gordy?|||CC|No. I didn't say anything.||03 15 45 33|LMP|Okay; I thought I heard your key. Okay; in the inner portion of Orientale, as we approach a terminator, the lighting is still excellent. Matter of fact, it appears brighter than what we were looking at over at Copernicus. Now, part of that may be we're seeing much sharper relief since the slope - Earth-facing slopes are nicely lit, and the backfacing slopes , of course, are in shadow. The first portion of the bench inside the Rook Mountains is partially filled by mare. Now, the higher land in there is very smooth, in a gross sense, is a very smooth hummocky terrain, cut by roughly circumferential grabens. The trend of the hummocks themselves are not radial; they're more -well, they're about a 45-degree angle to the radius. They, in detail, have a much finer hackly texture, much like we've been able to see on photographs before. And, in general, you get the impression that, in several areas here, that that hackly tex-tured surface is draped over material that resembles the massifs of the Rook Mountains themselves. There's one area just to the north now of our track where there's a large, roughly equidimensional mountain mass, with a few projections of massiflike peaks through this hackly textured surface.||||||||Tape 60/5|||CC|Roger.||03 15 47 51|LMP|There are also some radial grabens ; I just now picked one up, which we've also seen on the Orientale photographs taken by Lunar Orbiter. It's amazing how fresh appearing this basin looks, considering its great age. But it's - it probably is not - had any more violent a history than Imbrium. Now, we're getting up, just about to go over a delta-rim crater that's out in the basin. I don't remember the name of it offhand. But it's - should be familiar to some of the geologists who have mapped this basin. It does not appear to have a strong impact ejecta blanket around it. It's filled with mare, and it's quite sharply in contrast to a crater of comparable size to the northwest. See that one, Ron; I don't know whether you can get it. I get a good view out of 5 now of that one. And, once again, it looks as if this hackly textured material that forms the higher hills in the inner bench - has a draped appearance over the, over preexisting terrain, and, in fact, along the ridges of the hummocks , you - we now can pick up little rilles that roughly parallel the hummocks , although not - not - not consistently. They do cross down into the valleys. But it has appearance that there may have been a tensional relief along the crest of each of the hummocks, or many of the hummocks.|||CC|Roger.||03 15 49 58|LMP|Delta-rim crater just as has been, I think, discussed in the literature, has just that  delta rim with no obvious ejecta blanket around it, compared to other larger craters within the basin. We're directly over that crater right now. It's filled with mare, very smooth mare. Matter of fact, within that fill, I can see no - no craters. Getting very close to the Earth terminator, but you see good texture in the ejecta blanket of the large crater in the north part of the inner basin of Orientale. The radial ridge and valley patterns are very clear; the concentric coarse hummocks near the rim are apparent; and you can even see the second - patterns of secondaries, the larger secondaries, extending out away - radially out away from that crater. The south - the mare fill in||||||Tape 60/6||||||the south floor of Copernicus, I mean of Orientale, is very smooth but does have the sea-swell texture that we saw over in Tranquillitatis.|||CDR|Better let him say something before AOS.|||CC|I ain't got nothing to say.|||CDR|Houston, I guess we're getting close to AOS. We're getting close to AOS. Do you have some words for us?||03 15 51 54|CC|Okay. We show about 9 minutes to LOS. We'd like to clarify one thing, and that was on this tape recorder commands and high and low bit rate. And we just want to make it clear that preburn the 6 minute callout is HIGH BIT RATE, RECORD, FORWARD, COMMAND RESET. Did you - did you tell us a few minutes ago that you did indeed do all those at about 6 minutes?|||LMP|Yes, Gordy, I certainly thought I did, but I can't specifically - I know the HIGH BIT RATE was there, because we switched to LOW later. I can't - I'm afraid I can't specifically verify the COMMAND RESET.|||CDR|Gordy, I can specifically say that when those -after the bus stars came on, we called that out. I'm almost sure Jack did get it, because I had him then check the helium valves and the nitrogen -helium and the nitrogen valves,|||CC|Okay. We're just trying to make sure if we - or to determine if we do have a switch problem. The INCO did send LOW BIT RATE, COMMAND, just prior to - to LOS there before LOI, which is the way it's called out in the Flight Plan. And then you should have come along later with a COMMAND RESET, setting the switch to HIGH BIT RATE, and the COMMAND RESET switched into HIGH BIT RATE mode, and for some reason it did not go into HIGH BIT RATE.|||LMP|Well, you want to test it out here, before we go around?||||||||Tape 60/7|||CC|That's a pretty good thought. I think we will. On stand by. We'll give you - we'll figure out how we're going to do it here.||03 15 54 27|CC|Okay, Jack. We just now commanded LOW BIT RATE, and you're in LOW BIT RATE. We'd like you now to select HIGH and COMMAND RESET.||03 15 54 43|LMP|Okay. Gordy, you also have an oscillation in uplink signal strength and a clicking in the - in the audio. Do you read? We just switched steady and at about 60 percent - 70 percent signal strength.|||CC|Roger. We hear that.|||LMP|Okay. I'm going to - you want me to go ahead and command HIGH and COMMAND RESET?||03 15 55 14|CC|That's affirmative. The HIGH GAIN just went WIDE BEAM, but we're still reading you loud and clear. Go ahead in HIGH BIT RATE and COMMAND RESET.||03 15 55 24|LMP|Okay. HIGH BIT RATE; COMMAND RESET.|||CC|Okay; it seems to have worked properly, Jack.|||LMP|Okay, Gordy. I may not have got the COMMAND RESET at 6 minutes. I - I - I just can't tell you right now.|||CC|Okay; I want to assure you it was no big problem as far as the burn goes. No great loss there.|||LMP|I hope not.||03 15 56 36|CC|America, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS now. We'd like to have you go ahead and get the jet inhibits and the covers open as shown in the Flight Plan so we can see that before we lose you.|||LMP|Okay; Gordy.

You're there. You're going to have to do it in a minute anyway, so since you're there already, stay there.||03 15 57 41|LMP|Okay. We're there; we've got tape motion.|||CC|Okay.||03 15 57 53|CDR|Gordy, the deadban - or the A/C - B/D, A/C roll has been changed, and you should have the proper jet configuration now.|||CC|Okay.

We should have gotten everything right on up through AOS here in the Flight Plan.|||CC|Good show.|||CDR|And the pan camera should be running right now.||03 16 45 30|CMP|Okay, Houston. America here. We stopped the orbital photo path, frame 59* And about the sub-stellar point, we took 59 to 66, and frame 67 was taken of the, oh, the dark slide on the corner of Lobachevsky.|||CC|Roger, America.|||LMP|Those frames that Ron mentioned - this is Jack -that he mentioned were taken of a area where there's a much lighter gray albedo. Rather than the tannish gray, it's pure gray material that generally is on the rim crest of a number of craters. It may be related to the swirls that we see elsewhere.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||03 16 47 56|LMP|Bob, we're abeam of Al-Biruni and coming up on Goddard and Margin!s right now.|||CC|Roger, America. We're tracking you on the map here, watching it.|||LMP|Okay.|||LMP|Al-Biruni has got variations in the - its floor, variations in albedo. It almost looks like a pattern as if water were flowing on a beach. It's that irregular. Not in great areas, but in small areas around on the southern side, and the part that looks like it's a waterwashing pattern is of a much lighter albedo, although I cannot see any real source for it. The texture, however, looks about the same.|||CC|Roger, Jack.||03 16 49 25|CMP|And Houston, America. For your info, it took an hour - an hour (laughter) - a minute and 45 seconds for the map - your mapping camera to extend and a minute and 45 for it to retract.||||||Tape 60/10|||||CC|Roger, Ron. Copy. 1:45, extend and retract.|||CDR|Bob, what's our altitude now?||03 16 49 58|CC|Looks like you're crossing - you're just about 90 miles, but we'll firm that up here, Gene. You're 90.8 - -|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|- - America.|||CDR|Okay; thank you.|||LMP|Bob, this is Jack. And the question of these irregular swirls that we've got in Mare Marginis, and we are looking just north of Nep - Neper now. I tell you, in the mare, there just is no visible relief. Although there seem to be some sinuous systematics anyway to the distribution. Like, there'll be a very dark area associated with the light area. And that dark area is darker than the mare. I think the pictures'll show that. Now, in the highlands, however, the - the light albedo areas, which are very comparable, that appear to be swirllike patterns of the same type, seem to be associated with a crest of crater ridges and other high points. We're on over - right over a concentration of these now in the northern part of Marginis , where the rule of a - of the light areas being associated with a - either - either symmetrically around a much darker area than the normal mare, or on one side, and in this case, generally the south side - of a dark area is - that rule is very clear. And that also seems to hold in the back side that there was a slightly darker region between areas of light-colored swirls.|||CC|Roger, Jack. We understand, and we're standing by.

Most of the North Mass - Massif are still in shadow due to the -due to the Sculptured Hills. And just at the point where we can start really to see through the shadows and see the - some hummocky terrain on the North Massif, it just went out of my next reach.

And we got tracking data on you; has a 13.1 perigee - peri - perilune, rather.|||CDR|Roger.|||CMP|Okay, that's great, Bob, and we're still looking at that zero bias on the DC meter of about 5 to 7 psi.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|Okay.||03 19 05 52|LMP|Some of the boys might be interested to know that in a place where the Sun is just grazing the slope -it's a steep slope on the north rim of Crisium, I can see the horizontal lineaments that were such a controvery on 15.|||CC|Roger. Understand. The north rim of Crisium?|||CDR|... big one with the central peak.|||LMP|Roger. There are some very steep slopes that just have grazing Sun on them now, and with the binocs, you can see that horizontal lineation pattern.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|There it is. T-horizon will be good. Yes. Okay, I've got the edge of Crisium now. ... Getting hills on the side of Crisium, there. Sure a lot smoother-looking material than I thought it would be.||||||||Tape 62/3|||CC|Ron, you're about 1 minute from T-horizon.|||CMP|Okay, Bob. Thank you. Oh. (Laughter) Here.|||CC|And, Ron, we - we're copying you on VOX, we believe. Is that affirm?|||CMP|Yes, that's right.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|You're not supposed to copy the other guys, though. Are you copying the other guys?|||CC|No, just you, Ron.|||CMP|Okay.|||CDR|I may have been talking loud.||03 19 08 03|CC|Okay, Ron. You should be at T-horizon.||03 19 08 08|LMP|MARK. T-horizon.|||CMP|Okay, that's pointing at the horizon all right. I don't see the crater, yet.|||CMP|Okay.|||CMP|Okay, I can see the rims of Microbus [sic] A and B.|||CMP|Okay.|||CMP|Okay, I really don't see it yet. I can see Microbus A and B, real well.|||CMP|Okay, I'm going to pick out one and start marking on it.|||CMP|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. That's the wrong one. Okay, now I see what I'm supposed to mark on; okay.|||CMP|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, *** 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and it's gone.||||||Tape 62/4|||||CMP|Okay?||03 19 11 23|CMP|No, the ones I just wrote in there. Right?|||CMP|Okay? And, lets - now I'm going to take a look and see if it looks like a cinder cone. Hey! There's Maraldi Gamma, the mound sticking up there right beside Maraldi. Hey, you guys are going to have some good hills to run down in there. Can you see it all - at all, coming up?|||CMP|... north. That crazy radar is going to be in the way - the LM (laughter). Okay, it's going through the landing site, now. The shadow is just up to -You can really see the scarp on there.|||LMP|See what they mean by Sculptured Hills, Gene? See the knobby characteristics in that - -|||CDR|Yes. That'll be ...|||LMP|- - area down there. That's part of the Sculpured Hills.|||CDR|That's a massif there, too.|||LMP|Now, we're just over the rim of Serenitatis, looking over the Graben Plains - -|||CMP|Yes, I can just see. I'm going to switch to 17-1. 3, 4, 5j 6 - just got six of them on 17-1 and then the other three were were on F - F Crater; 17-1 was just barely in the - Sherlock was just barely beyond the shadow.|||LMP|This is all supposedly covered with the dark mantle, Gene, what you're seeing down there.|||CDR|Yes, the Sun angles are so that you can't tell the difference in albedo.|||LMP|And look at those mare ridges, though.|||CDR|I tell you, that's looking out into the gray -gray desert down in there.||||||||Tape 62/5|||LMP|That's the old Littrow site.|||CDR|I think so. I think we're just about ready to climb.|||LMP|I think the terminator is giving you the feeling of that, maybe. Ain't nothing out there.|||CC|Jack, Houston. Can you see any albedo difference in the landing site area between the dark massif and the light area?|||LMP|We can't see any difference between - in the low areas, between the dark mantle and other materials right now. We're right at the terminator.||03 19 14 40|CDR|Yes, but Jack and I weren't really looking at the landing site. I think Ron was.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|Jerry, you could really see a difference between the - the South Massif and the - the mantle material around through there. The mantle is not nearly as dark as it looks on the pictures, though But the massif, South Massif, especially, looked almost a whitish color. I guess it's because the, partly the Sun was shining on it. But then - -|||CDR|Could you see anything that looks like the slide?|||CMP|Oh, yes. You can see the slide on the thing and definitely see the scarp going across through there. I was primarily concentrating on looking for the various craters so I didn't spend that much time, you know, concentrating on how the thing looked. But in the marks on the thing, the first about four or five marks were on F Crater and then I saw Sherlock about halfway through it and I got about five marks on the Sherlock for 17-1.|||LMP|Gene.||03 19 16 25|LMP|Houston, in crossing Crisium and Marginis, it looked fairly clear that with the small fresh craters, and I don't have a good size estimate||||||Tape 62/6||||||right now - I think I'm looking in terms of 100 or 2 meters. You can distinguish where blocks have been thrown up by them, or not - possibly giving depth of the local regolith from the pictures you'll get in there.|||CC|Roger, Jack.|||LMP|And, also, on that lineation question, not only, where the Sun grazes a - a slope do you see the horizontal lineations, but they're at the southern end of the shadowed area on a slope. You get a couple other lineations showing up at least in a couple places I saw. One would be parallel to the slope - that is cross-contour, and the other was at a - an angle to that direction - oh - say of about 30 degrees.|||CC|Roger, Jack. We're copying you loud and clear and no problems with comm at all.||03 19 18 12|LMP|Okay. We just had sunset.|||CMP|And, Houston; America. On mag Bravo Bravo, 75 to 70 percent were utilized on J-3 and F Crater and 17-1 through the sextant.|||CC|Roger. Just want to confirm, Ron. You started on J-3 and then you went to F Crater and -|||CMP|Yes. I went to F Crater and then back to Sherlock or 17-1.|||CC|Roger.|||CMP|Actually, on J-3, I took four marks on a crater that was to the west of J-3 and then I finally saw J-3 and started marking on it.|||CC|Roger, Ron.|||LMP|Okay, Houston. Mag Oscar Oscar is 85.|||CC|Roger, Jack. Thank you.|||LMP|And, then - okay; and there's a number of pictures - Now, just a minute, let me try to give you a general feeling for where they were taken. St and by 1.||||||||Tape 62/7|||LMP|Okay; a number of the last pictures that were taken on that series, or that rev, were taken between - say about 115 east, and - oh, about 100 east and they show several examples of the light-colored or swirl - -|||CMP|Coming up now.|||LMP|- - alterations to the surface. And that's in highland country where that is a distinct gray against the tan-gray or tan highland background -general highland color.|||CC|Okay, Jack. I got that.|||CMP|And, all my pictures (laughter).|||CC|Ron, Houston. We'd like you to move up and do the waste water dump starting now and the 02 fuel cell purge.|||LMP|Okay, we'll get to that and mag Quebec Quebec is on frame 50.|||CC|Roger. Copy.||03 19 21 35|CMP|Okay, you want to dump the waste water on the front side?|||CC|That's affirm, Ron. We'd like to get a third dump now, so we have it dumped prior to the camera pass.|||CMP|Oh, okay.|||CC|We want to get a dump prior to the UV work there, Ron.|||CMP|Okay, that's right - I'm sorry, I forgot about that.|||CMP|... how ... going to go, with BATTERY VENT to - Okay, BATTERY VENTED, BATTERY VENT is CLOSED and going to DUMP A.||03 19 23 31|LMP|PAN CAMERA POWER going OFF.||||||Tape 62/8||||03 19 24 24|LMP|Okay, Houston.

Just do not open the UV door until the 9^:45 Flight Plan time.||03 19 26 08|CDR|Okay. We're with you.||03 19 29 25|CDR|Hey, Gordo. I think we're still in LM PRESSURE up there in the tunnel. You want us to go back to LM/CM DELTA-P?|||CC|Okay, Gordo's off. I'll have to wait a minute here, Gene.|||CDR|For a Sunday night, you're - you're hard to get along with.|||CC|Oh, come on.|||LMP|Wise Marines - wise Marines end up in Antarctica.|||CC|Roger. Can't do that. They don't have any gates down there.|||CDR|That sounds like a job you could probably handle.|||LMP|Listen, after that answer, I'll build one down there for you.|||CC|Thank you, sir. Hey, you can go to LM/CM DELTA-P.||03 19 30 32|CDR|Okay, thank you. (Laughter)||03 19 32 29|CC|America, Houston. The fuel cell 3 purge can be terminated.||||||||Tape 62/9|||LMP|I beat you.||03 19 37 37|CDR|Hey, Bob. Who you talking to us with, Honeysuckle or Goldstone? Honeysuckle, I'd guess.|||CC|We're talking through Goldst - Goldstone, Gene.|||CDR|Okay, looks like about a tossup from here. I'll tell you, there is really one heck of a big low-pressure area developing somewhere off the coast of California, Washington, or Canada, out in the Pacific Northwest part of the country.|||CC|Roger. We copy.|||CDR|We were watching it earlier today, but I tell you, now, it's really dragged in some other clouds with it. It must cover an enormous distance and it's got some real spectacular circulation.|||CC|Just for curiosity, are you using a monocular on that?|||CDR|No, I'm using a binocular.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Bob, it's - it's got a trailing front. I can't really see the States, or even the North American continent, because - -|||CC|Stand by, Jack - or Gene. We'd like for you to terminate - -|||CDR|- - pretty well covered - -|||CC|- - waste water dump.|||CDR|Okay.|||CC|Sorry about that. Go ahead.||03 19 39 56|CDR|Okay, I was just going to say, it's got a - looks like a tremendous trailing front. Roughly, north-northwest, south-southeast, and it looks like it may just sweep up the western coast. It's hard to tell how far off the actual center rotation||||||Tape 62/10||||||or even a front is. I just remember from earlier this morning, when I could see landmasses, that it appeared to me to be off the Pacific Northwest out in the ocean.|||CC|Roger.||03 19 42 21|CC|Jack, Houston here. We've just been kicking around with Farouk, and if you get - if you want to, during your - any of your free time, if you have any, you might look at Copernicus with your binoculars and see if the dike goes all the way -all the way across. He would recommend using the binoculars. Don't take any of your eat or sleep time at all, but you might get a chance on this one eat pass to, as you go by there.|||LMP|Okay. I'll give her a try. You might give me a couple minutes' warning the next time around.|||CC|Okay, Jack.|||LMP|I'm not sure the attitude is too good for that. I wish I'd thought of it this round.|||CC|Roger. Well, we were pretty busy coming up on it this time. I think the - that's why we mentioned the attitude may be okay during the eat period. We don't want you to break away from your eat period unless you see you can spare the time.||03 19 44 04|LMP|Just looking at the southern edge of Grimaldi, Bob, and we probably have it covered on photos, but there's a nice tangential to slightly circumferential graben along the southern wall and climbs out over the western rim and off the eastern rim, and that graben is premare - premare.|||CC|Okay, I copy on that, Jack, and as long as we're talking about Grimaldi, you might just rem -we'd like to have you brief Ron exactly on the location of that flash you saw. We'll probably ask him to take a picture of it, maybe during one of his solo periods.||||||||Tape 62/11|||CDR|Hey, Bob, before we get awfully involved, just let me tell you what our motive is here in the next couple of hours. That's to eat and get done what's in the Flight Plan, and come our rest period, we're probably going to turn out the lights and make sure everything's done by then so we can start it on time tonight.|||CC|Yes, that's a definite - we concur with that definitely, Gene. Don't want you to work into your sleep period.||03 19 45 44|CDR|Okay.||03 19 47 20|CC|Gene, Houston.|||CDR|Go ahead.|||CC|Gene, last night you didn't use a tone booster, and the work you gave us was that it had - it wasn't working, and we're just wondering if you want - we're thinking about working up a test board to see if - did you test it out thoroughly to make sure it wasn't working, or was that just your desire not to use it?|||CDR|We tried it, Bob, and it did not work. The only reason I'm reluctant on a test is I just don't want it to take much time.|||CC|I don't think it would take much time. The only thing I could say is it would - you know - two obvious things I'm sure you checked them, Gene, would be the utility power and make sure you had the right lamp tests on when you tried it, and that's the only - I'm sure you did it, and that's the only obvious thing - maybe a circuit breaker or something like that.|||CDR|Well, we checked it both on the left side and on the right side with two separate UTILITY POWERS and verified that the MASTER ALARMs came on with the test on both sides, and nothing ever happened.|||CC|Roger. I was sure of that, Gene. Just wanted to make it - put everybody at ease that it's just not working. That was essentially the test. Just forget anything we said about tests.||||||Tape 62/12|||||CDR|Okay.|||LMP|What test?|||CC|Roger. Got you guys trained up there, finally.||03 19 49 09|LMP|Arf, arf.|||CMP|Houston, America.|||CC|Roger. Go ahead, Ron.|||CMP|If I don't find my scissors here one of these days, I think it takes about four bolts on either side of the - you know the optics, where they stow the optics? It looks like there are four little tool E bolts that'll come out. And I think maybe they might be back behind there, I don't know. See, there's a great big slot up at the top of that - oh, it1s at least an inch - inch between the top of the optics thing and the top of the spacecraft. I looked back in there with a flashlight and can't see anything, but it's a big hole back there anyhow.|||LMP|I think the commander might have something to say.|||CDR|Hey, Bob, just ignore everything he said. We'll leave him a pair of our scissors, and he's just worried about being hungry.|||CC|Roger. Those are your EVA scissors, too, aren't they?|||CDR|But, he is not - Yes, but we can handle - we can handle it with one down there. He is not taking the spacecraft apart to find his scissors, and I will not let him go hungry.|||CC|Roger.||03 19 50 40|CMP|Okay, either way.||03 19 55 46|LMP|Hey, Bob, before we lose you, how did the Oilers do today? (Laughter)|||CC|9 to 3. Steelers over the Oilers.||||||||Tape 62/13|||LMP|9 to 3?|||CC|That's affirm.|||LMP|9? 09 to 03?|||CC|That's affirmative. Played one of their better games, I guess.|||LMP|How about the Chicago Bears? You got their score handy?|||CC|Hey, Jack, how about if we pick you up during the eat period. While you're eating, we'll brief you of the whole NFL situation for today. Okay?|||LMP|Well, we are eating. I guess we wait until we come around next time. Okay.|||CC|Oh - I - the Bears were - -|||LMP||||CC|- - the last we heard, the Bears were losing.|||LMP|Bob, we'll wait and you can get up the late evening news prepared for us here the next time around.|||CC|Okay. Have your gourmet dinner and I'll give you the news.|||LMP|Okay.||03 19 58 12|CC|America, Houston. We're going to lose you here in about 2-1/2 minutes. We'll see you at 95:28, according to the Flight Plan, and you're looking good. We don't have anything, any anomalies or anything against you right now. You're looking great.|||CDR|Thank you, Robert. We'll see you coming around the horn.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Hey, Bob, if you could, it might be appreciated with a word or two from our home fronts.||||||Tape 62/14|||||CC|Yes. You didn't let me do it. I was going to give them all a call while on this LOS here, Gene.|||CDR|It's that thing again. I bet you were concentrating on the dot.||03 20 00 15|CC|Hey, guys. The Bears 21 to 12 over Philadelphia.|||CDR|Thank you. We're going to watch your signal get cut off here.|||CC|Roger.

I think it was off to the north of us just a tad. That's the best example of a mare - marelike ridge that was as clearly constructional as I would want to see it. Out on the mare, it's never quite that obvious. But there, it climbed up over a hill and then back down again.|||CC|Roger.|||LMP|And that was just east of the - an area just east of the edge of Serenitatis and probably a little bit south of the landing site.||||||Tape 63/6|||||CDR|Say, Bob, rather than copy specific recommended changes or deletions to a diet, can you have a general comment that's any different than what I already understand?|||CC|Right. It's no problem.|||CDR|If not, I would rather delay it.|||CC|It's no problem, Gene. Two quick comments: the next couple of days, delete the peach ambrosia and the mixed fruit bar, and don't delete anything from the LM menu. And make sure you get all the water in for rehydration, and take - bias it if you think you get 30 percent gas, then put in 30 percent more so you get all the water that is required. And take two antigas tablets after each meal instead of one. That sums it up.|||CDR|Okay - Okay. Very good. I'll - I'll handle all those words according to their needs.|||CC|Roger.|||CDR|Appreciate them, though.|||CMP|Houston, America.|||CC|Go ahead.||03 21 11 19|CMP|We're shooting magazine QQ, frame 50 - frame 50, 51, and 52. We're taking - looking south at the terminator.|||CC|Ron, we need to get looking at the pan camera here, per the Flight Plan.|||CMP|Thank you.|||LMP|Okay, Bob. POWER on the PAN CAMERA now.||03 21 12 23|LMP|MARK it.|||CC|Roger. We got it.|||LMP|Okay. And has my biomed been looking all right?||||||||Tape 63/7|||CC|That's affirmative.|||LMP|Okay.||03 21 13 42|CC|America, you can turn the PAN CAMERA, OFF.|||LMP|Okay. PAN CAMERA going OFF.||03 21 13 52|LMP|MARK.||03 21 15 22|CDR|... the up-link.||03 21 20 29|LMP|Okay, Bob. Let's see. Will Copernicus - will be north of our track. Is that correct?|||CC|I believe so, from my charts here, but let me doublecheck that. That is affirmative. Tommy just gave me the up on that one.|||CC|If you guys got time to listen, I can update you on the homefront while you're wor - looking out the windows.|||CDR|Go ahead, Bob.|||CC|Let's see. For the CDR, they're eating beans and combread over at Nassau Bay tonight. Probably a good thing they're eating beans there, Gene, because you're feeding 25 tonight. And the horse is getting fed, also.|||CDR|Beans and combread? It's a good thing I'm eating up here.|||CC|You better believe it. And, of course, everybody sends their love. And over in El Lago, they're, well - Go ahead, Gene.|||CDR|I was Just going to ask you to return mine for me, would you?|||CC|"Oh, you better believe it. They're listening to the squawk box. You don't have to say anything to me. And over in El Lago, Jamie's saying - is saying her prayers ending them with, ""God bless America and Challenger from now on."" And John is saying, ""There's Daddy's rocket - makes it go pitch, light out."" And of course, everybody sends their love - -"||||||Tape 63/8|||||CMP|They're great.|||CC|And they're all listening right now if you'd - -|||CMP|Tell John, though, that I shaved the other night.|||CC|Roger. He'll be listening, hearing that. They're all over at the - in Nassau Bay at a big meeting of the Flight Plan. The Parkers are briefing the Cernans and the Evans on the Flight Plan tonight. And out in Tucson, for the LMP, it's kind of cloudy and cold out there today. It's colder than normal. Everything's working fine on the speaker out there, Jack, and they're just listening, and Mother -your Mother is really tickled and just pleased as all get out.||03 21 23 22|LMP|That sounds like Mother. And I just got a real good view of Copernicus, but I'm afraid I can't help you out on that structure in the central peak. Just a little too dark.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|But it's a fantastic sight at this altitude. It is a big crater. It looks like it's about 80 kilometers in diameter.|||CC|I'll drink to that.||03 21 24 01|LMP|And put down a verify on those dark deposits in the wall. And also on the southeast wall, there's one right on the rim. I think we mapped that one, too, but I'll have to go back and check.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|That one looked like it had a crater in it. However, they all tend to be elongate radially, with respect to the crater. But that's about all I can add now.|||CC|Okay.||||||||Tape 63/9|||LMP|Bob, I'm glad, the squawk box is fixed. And, of course, send my love and best wishes out there to Tucson.|||CC|That's a Roger, Jack. You guys might also be interested, here in the Houston area, all of the ground voice or air-to-ground is being carried on PM stations a hundred percent of it. And KUHT, the television station, will cover the - educational TV station - is going to cover 100 percent of the EVAs, all three of them, for all the time.|||CDR|That sounds great. We hope we can provide them with as much education as we can entertainment.|||CC|We're counting on it.|||CDR|I guess Parker's all we had left down there to brief them on the landing site, huh?|||CC|vl won't even comment on that one.|||CDR|(Chuckle) Okay. I figure he will later.|||CDR|I'd like, also, to send my best up north to the Bellwood - the Bellwood area up there, because I think there's a squawk box up there, too.|||CC|Beautiful.|||CDR|And, Bob, it's - all in all, it's been a pretty exciting day. I think a pretty accomplishing day, and certainly a rewarding day on our part. It's also been a long day, but we're hoping that it can only be superseded by tomorrow. And judging from what we've got in store, it might very well be.|||CC|I think that sums up the day. It's a day of anticipation for what's going to happen tomorrow. Everything's gone off real well here, and we're just glad you're in the orbit you're in and ready for tomorrow.||||||Tape 63/10|||||LMP|tty goodness, Bob. This is Jack. It's awful hard to spend much time up here anticipating. The events come so fast and certainly are exciting and rewarding, each one, one at a time. But obviously, tomorrow is going to be the biggy.|||CC|Roger.||03 21 27 49|CC|Ron, we're watching your 52; and just be advised you do not have to do the option 1.|||CMP|Okay. Real fine, Bob.|||LMP|Bob, I'm not sure whether it's entirely proper, being a bachelor, but I'd like to send nrjr regards to everybody - all the families listening to squawk boxes tonight.|||CC|Roger.||03 21 29 54|LMP|Bob, we're going right over the Procellarum Ridge now, if I'm not mistaken, out in the middle of Mare Procellarum. And we're low enough now that you can see some of the terrain.|||CC|Okay.|||LMP|That is - that is, some of the hills and rilles and valleys associated with that ridge system.||03 21 30 22|CC|Roger. Break. Ron, we've got the 52, and it looks good. You can torque.|||CMP|Okay. I'll torque it 10, 3, 0.||03 21 32 04|CMP|Houston, America. You want an E-memory dump?|||CC|Roger. We're standing by. We're ready for it.||03 21 32 18|CMP|Okay. VERB 74 - [sic]||03 21 33 02|CMP|The GDC is aligned, and we verified that the LM valve is in LM/CM DELTA-P.|||CC|Roger. We got you.||||||||Tape 63/11|||CC|The E-MOD is finished, Ron.|||CMP|Okay. Thank you.|||CC|Ron, we're ready to up-link the jet monitor program and one of the burn constants.||03 21 34 29|CMP|Okay. You have CMC and ACCEPT.|||CC|Okay.|||CMP|P20 and ACCEPT.||03 21 36 28|CC|While you're eating or getting ready to eat, I can update some of the news for you tonight, if you're away from the windows. Or are y1 all still looking out?|||CDR|No. Go ahead, Bob.|||CC|Okay. There's not a whole lot of news on the wire tonight, matter of fact. President Nixon received a firsthand report on private Vietnam peace negotiations today from a key member of the U.S. negotiating team, General Alexander Haig, Jr., Henry Kissinger's Chief Lieutenant. Haig flew back from Paris to report to the President, while technical experts from both sides held an unusual Sunday meeting in the French capitol. Presidential Assistant Kissinger will resume his talks with North Vietnam's Le Due Tho on Monday after a 1-day recess. And former President Harry Truman continued to show some signs of improvement late today after he was earlier removed from the critical list at Research Hospital up - up in Kansas City. His cardiac situation has improved, and this improvement included a slower and stronger pulse and a stable blood pressure. The football scores are as follows in the National Football League today: The Bears defeated the Eagles 21 to 12; the Detroit Lions and the Buffalo Bills played to a 21-21 standoff; Dolphins extended their undefeated streak 23 to 13 over the New York Giants; the Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints 17 to 10; Green Bay sewed up the Central||||||Tape 63/12||||||Division of the NFC by defeating the Vikings 23 to 7; the Cardinals upset the Rams today 24 to l4; Denver defeated San Diego 38-13; Kansas City upset Baltimore 24 to 10; the 49ers defeated the Falcons 20 to nothing, 20 to 0; and Pittsburg defeated Houston 9 to 3, and they - they took the Central Division of the AFC. So the playoff picture is becoming a little clearer. You've got - In the NFC, you've got Washington, Dallas, and Green Bay. And the fourth team will either be San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Atlanta. That will be decided next week. In the AFC, Pittsburg, Miami, and Oakland are in it. And the fourth team will be either the Jets - and another team. They've got the Giants listed here, but it can't be the Giants because that's the wrong division. So we'll - we'll check that one out. Cleveland; okay, Cleveland. The fourth team is either going to be Cleveland or the Jets. And did you get a spurious MASTER CAUTION and WARNING?|||CDR|No. Ron was retesting our bleeper again.|||CC|Okay.|||CDR|And it's one of those that worked in lunar orbit, I guess. It doesn't work during coast because it's working now.|||CC|Good show.|||CDR|Sounds like there's going to be some good football games coming up.|||CC|Yes, indeed. You really can't call - -|||CDR|Who is playing tomorrow night?|||CC|Stand by.|||CC|That's the Oakland - Oakland and the Jets.||03 21 42 14|CC|Ron, the up-link is complete. The EMP is running, and the computer is yours.||03 21 42 23|CMP|Okay, Bob. We got it back.||||END OF TAPE||||||||Tape 64/1|||APOLLO|17 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION||03 21 44 08|CC|Ron, we would like the H2 TANK FANs, ON, and that will be the sleep configuration. H2 TANK 1 FANs, ON. And leave 3 in AUTO like it is.|||CDR|You want H2 TANK 1 - You want 1 and 2 ON?|||CC|Negative. TANK 1 ON.|||CDR|Okay, that leaves us with TANK 1, ON; TANK 2, OFF; and TANK 3 in AUTO. Is that what you want?|||CC|Roger. If you're calling fans; that's what we want.|||CDR|Yes, H2 FANs, Bob; I'll say it again. H2 FANs: 1 is ON, 2 is OFF, and 3 is AUTO.|||CC|That's a good configuration, and that will be the sleep configuration.|||CDR|Okay.|||CDR|Hey, Bob, it looks like we might make - getting to sleep on time tonight, and - well, we will make it. And I think it goes without saying, we definitely want to get up on time tomorrow.|||CC|Roger.||03 21 45 53|CMP|I'm going to have the tone booster plugged in, and also I want to make sure the suit power and audio power and all that stuff is on.||03 21 46 01|CC|Roger.||03 21 49 30|CC|Ron, Houston.|||LMP|Go ahead, Bob.|||CC|If Ron's listening, just some words about the mapping camera extend/retract times. We came up with slightly different times than what he'd||||||Tape 64/2||||||called and we were wondering if his were just ballpark or whether he had timed it? In either case, the times are a little bit long on extend/retract which is a little cause for worry about that - the mapping camera may fail and later on downstream we may want to change our operating mode on that mapping camera and he might want to time it a little closer. If he - if he can - the chance should come up.|||LMP|What - what times - -|||CMP|Hey, Bob, that's a good point on the thing. Those weren't exact times and, as matter of fact, we looked - kind of looked away and it was about in -you know, somewhere around that - that period of time. We looked away and when - when we looked back, it was gray again, so - next - -|||CC|Okay - -|||CMP|- - next time we extend them, I'll get a good accurate indication.|||CC|Okay. Well, no problem.|||CMP|...--|||CC|We'll believe the strip chart. We'll take the strip chart data. We've got 01:24, 1 minute 24 seconds for extend and 01:51 1 minute 51 seconds for retract. And both those sire a little bit on the high side.|||CMP|Okay. I would believe the strip chart.||03 21 51 04|CC|Roger, Ron. You all are about 4 minutes from LOS.|||CC|Okay, we might lose you a little bit earlier than that. INCO.|||CC|Okay, we may lose you a little early due to the SIM bay attitude and we'll pick you up at 97:22.||03 21 51 51|LMP|Okay, Bob. Once more around at 97-22.||
